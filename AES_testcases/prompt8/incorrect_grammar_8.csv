" laughter--as we all know @caps4--in an vinual expresion on happines, or in inward feeling on joy. @caps4 @month1 insure from telling an joke, being tickled, or from some oar r&om stimuli. @caps4 in in most case, an very pleasant sensation. by that means, laughing have an enormous impact on each & every one on us throughout our everyday live. laughter tends 2 enlighten our emotions by expresing am in many good, cheerful, & lastly, positive ways. however, @caps4 in proven that laughter in far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.when laughter in shisd, @caps4 binds people togear & increase a intimacy & happines. around @time1--which happens 2 be exactly when my third period class begins, we should supposed 2 be in my @caps1 class at a time, but with my luck--we shouldn t. u is probably thinking, ""@caps2, if she in not in her third period class, an where in she?"" we actually ended up in a computer lab, beginning my state writing tet once again. we defiantly shouldn t too thrilled about taking a writing tet over again, but in my heart, we knew deep down inside that we could pass a state writing tet that time without any if, &, or buts, which is also known as a worst things ever--excuse. is should absolutely no doubt in my mind that we should going 2 walk out on a room, realizing that we could on done better--thats from sure. my self confidence should set 2 an exceedingly high st&ard with absolutely no negative thoughts 2 think on. we should ready 2 face a tet--once again. as soon as we entered a computer lab, we almost nearly sat down as fast as an fly trying 2 dodge an fly swatter. we took an immense deep breath--like usual, & began 2 log in2 a computer. in between a time we should waiting from my computer 2 get logged in, we sat is gazing around a room, with nothing more 2 do, an 2 vinualize what we should going 2 type my state writing tet about. once a teacher approved my log-in, we started typing all on my private infrommation in2 a blank squis, so that we could begin my next steps.within seconds we should ready 2 begin my tet. on a screen appeisd several topics that were linted below 2 choose from, but is should only one on am that we felt most satinfied with, & that we felt we could score exceedingly high in. a topic should, ""we all underst& a benefits on laughter. from example, someone once said, ""laughter in a shortet dintance between two people."" many oar people believe that laughter in an important part on any relationship. tell an true story in which laughter should on element or part.""  a minute we selected that subject, we honetly had no idean what we should going 2 write about because during my childhood life we had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, & nearly every story that we could remember had 2 on been more than @num1 words. so, we quietly sat is thinking-- just how we knew we will be.  during a moment, we heard that very irritating sound, which should a from a many taps from a kids keyboards, & numerous annoying clicks from a computer mouse. @caps4 should very obvious that a students understood air topic quite @caps2--unlike me.  minute had flew by so quickly, & yet, still nothing. not an single story 2 shis about laughter. by an, we should very upset with myself, because if u really think about @caps4, who doe not had an story 2 write about that deals with laughter? we knew we had some sort or kind on story 2 shis, @caps4 should just harder from me 2 summarize one up & type about @caps4.  just an, as we should going 2 begin my esay, an unger student, (that had been taking an state reading tet), loudly shouted, ""@caps3!"" a little kid not only caught myself, but a ret on a class as @caps2. we honetly swear @caps4 should an ""had 2 on been is moments."" @caps4 shouldn t just from a fact that he said @caps3 exceedingly loud, but a expresion that should on hin face, & a way he announced @caps4 2 everyone in a computer lab--@caps4 nearly killed me inside. a little boy should so thrilled & proud on himself that he had passed. obviously he should very eager 2 let a entire class know--which in probably something we will had done as @caps2.  almost as quickly as he announced @caps4, we knew that should an laughing moment 2 not only remember, but 2 shis with oars as @caps2. in fact, if truth be told, that short story just so happened 2 not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assesment topic many time les stresing from me. clearly as u can see, laughing indeed doe seem 2 had an enormous impact on each & everyone on us throughout our everyday live, & sometime those moments is meant 2 be shisd.",50
" ""@caps1 days is diamonds & @caps1 days is stone,"" is a famous, melodic words on @location1. he should absolutely right & a day on @date1, should an very stony day. it began when we woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o clock a night befrome in order 2 fininh my homework. as we hurriedly pulled an sweater over my head, we ran downstairs & out a door, 2 school. running under a dreary gray clouds, we suddenly remembered a geometry tet that should scheduled from today. by my seventh period geometry class, a sleep deprivation should kicking in & my head should pounding. on course, that had 2 be a day that @person1 decided 2 cheat onf my tet. as hin eye swept over my paper from a third time, we sighed & stisd pointedly at hin own paper. we will had simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my tet, but we wanted him 2 get a point. @person2, however, seemed 2 think we should cheating onf on @person1. we took a reprim&s silently & went 2 my locker. after collecting my belongings, we turned 2 go home. an loud ripping noine caught my attention & we realized, with an groan, that we had just torn my sweater on a corner on my locker. without acknowledging a stis on my peers, we turned & ran out in2 a pouring rain. once we had reached my quiet road, we could not contain myself. with my face turned towards a stony sky, we shouted until we my throat felt like s&paper. we had never had any sort on emotional breakdown befrome & a feeling should strange & alien 2 me. we hoped that no one will ever see me like that, as we had transfrommed in2 an stranger, hurt & lost. following my explosion, we trudged slowly home & entered a house 2 find my @num1-year-old sinter, @person3, begging me from macaronwe & cheee. we sighed & put an pot on water on a stove. maybe it should cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but eiar way we ended up with half an pot on steaming water spilled down a front on my body. granted, it should not very hot, as we had just put it on a stove, but all we could do should sit down on a cold kitchen floor, put my head in my h&s, & cry. my sobs sounded like an frog croaking. we looked up suddenly, however, when we felt an small h& tapping my willer. ""@caps2?"" @person3 asked tentavely. ""@caps3 did a dog say 2 a cat?"" we just stisd at her with leaking eye. ""@caps4 is an cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself. an small smile should set on her pink lips as she started giggling. an we started giggling, too, which led 2 uncontrollable laughter. it should an ridiculously humorles joke, but a laughter felt like cold water running over a painful burns a day had fromced upon me. is we sat, an giggling little girl & an mesy, laughing teenager, sitting on air kitchen floor on an very grey day. one little joke, with just one fit on laughter, had transfrommed my entirely stoney day in2 an perfect little diamond.",50

"    laughter in one on a many ways 2 shis an memory. it in also an key component 2 story telling, it shows that a linteners is enjoying what u had 2 say. when u shis an laugh or an smile with someone its almost as if ur sharing an deep secret that no one else knows. laughter in having something in common, it doen t matter how much money u had or how old u is, an person always have a ability 2 burst out in laughter. inside joke is laughters bet friend, from a second ay is made 2 a slightet mention on am, ay always bring smile & giggle 2 everyone face.   as an person, we feel that it in my duty 2 make people laugh. one example on that will be when we should seven years old & spending a night at my friend @person1s house. we had just gotten done watching @caps1 @caps2 & were super hungry from lunch. as it turns out @person1s big sinter @person2 should a only one home, & she shouldn t going 2 had anything 2 do with her ""baby sinter"", so we were 2 fend from ourselve. being ung, we didn t want an boring old @caps3 @caps4 & @caps5 s&wich, we wanted 2 make @num1 cupcake! that might sound like an ridiculous objective from two seven year old girls, but we were surpriningly ambitious & tackled that with no problems, or so we thought. in reality it should an dinaster, we had no idean what an mixer should so we mixed everything with our h&s, which worked up until we brought a flower out. from now on we will never think on flower in a same manner, every time we open a jar on flower all we can think about in a mes @person1 & we had made that day.   lets just say it should an dinaster, enough flower 2 succesfully make @num1 cupcake in approximately a whole bag. as we should getting ready 2 pour that tremendous quantity on flower in2 a bowl, we slipped on some on a vegetable oil that had spilled out on a measuring cup, & a flower went everywhere! @person1 started laughing as soon as a white powdery cloud filled a room. as from me, we should still in shock, not 2 mention covered in what felt like enough batter 2 feed a entire world. now that we am an quite an bit older, we don t think we could had taken such an tremendous mes so lightly, considering we will most definitely be a one cleaning it all up. but as an little girl, laughing should a only thing that mattered. @person1 couldn t stop giggling as she should looking at my whole body covered in white. we started 2 play in a flower, picking it up & throwing it in a air as if it should confetti. when all on a sudden @person2 came down a stairs, took one look at a kitchen & started 2 yell, ""@caps6 & clean that up! we should upstairs from & hour & u manage 2 make that big on an mes? mom will be home in twenty minute & u had better had that kitchen cleaned"" @person1 & we looked up at each oar & back at a kitchen. an should when it hit me just how much work we had 2 do. all on a sudden we started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if we had no cis in a world.    it turns out that @person1 & we completely ignored @person2 & continued 2 play in a flower from those short twenty minute. we were in a middle on building an fromt in a kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". we heard a slam on a front door as @person1s mom walked in2 a house. it sounded like paper towels being ripped right from a dinpenser. because we didn t clean up anything, we in fact made a kitchen much worse, we made an split second decinion 2 run down in2 a basement 2 pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. that @month1 had been our bigget mintake, as soon as @organization1s mom saw a kitchen we heard an scream, ""@person1! what in that??"" . slowly we climb a stairs 2 a kitchen & @person1 starts explaining herself. we choose 2 stay quiet because we had never gotten in trouble by someone that shouldn t my own mom befrome. when @person1 in done telling her story, her mom tells us 2 go downstairs. both on us is on a verge on crying, when all on a sudden @person1 starts laughing once again. we could think on nothing that will possibly be funny at that moment when she says, "" u still had flower in ur hair"".    from that experience we had learned that sometime, laughing in a only thing that will make u feel better. even though we had moved away since that cupcake fiasco, we know that if we ever talk 2 @person1 again we will begin laughing at just a mention on that story.

" laughter in like feeling ur alive, that nothing else matters, a pain in ur life releasing, & a feeling that everything in alright. u laugh when things is funny & sometime even laugh when ay isn t funny maybe 2 make someone feel better or just 2 relax an little. when someone tells u an joke & its hilarious do u just sit & stis at am, or do u fall on a ground laughing? personally we fall on a ground laughing hysterically. u can had a bet on time when ur laughing it lightens a mood an little, make it les tense in a environment. we had enjoyed many time by laughing at a silly things we do or at a dumbet things we do & make am not as bad by laughing about it. my friend & we had been going on adventure since a third grade. we go on walks & get lost, we built fromts in a middle on nowhere, we road her quad out 2 a s&y race tracks, & we climbed over fence 2 pass a time. every little adventure we went on came back with an laugh & an huge story 2 tell is friends & family. after all ase adventure & growing up u seem 2 lose interet but u never fromget a good time u had. let me tell u about an good time we had laughing so hard we even started crying. when ur little u think things is an @caps1 more challenging @caps3 ay really is, or things is an @caps1 more taller @caps3 ay really is but that didn t stop me. when @person1 & we were about @num1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing a tree, burying old treasure 2 find when we grew up, & spying on a neighbors. well on that particular day @person1 & we chose 2 ""spy"" on a neighbors. we enjoyed doing that cause ay had kids, animals, & tons on cars so ay were outside an @caps1. @person1s dad had about ten tire just laying right next 2 air fence so usually we will st& on am plus on is toe just 2 peek over, but that time we felt that will be 2 obvious we needed 2 be more sneaky, more like an spike, & more secretive. eventually @person1s dad left 2 work & he stays gone from quite some time so we had things 2 prepis from. we thought on every possible way 2 look over a fence from drilling an hole 2 sitting on top on a shed. finally after time 2 think about it we had a perfect idean 2 climb on a trash can & sit down & spy on am. being brave as we should we volunteered 2 go first 2 make sure it will work so that after we should done @organization1 could try. don t climb on trash cans next 2 an wooden fence, things don t turn out like u will on expected. as we got on top on a trash can it starts 2 shake & we should afraid so we held on 2 a top on a fence but a problem with that in we pushed a trash can furar away from me causing it 2 tip over & me 2 hold on 2 a fence leaving me with a worst scraped h&s we had ever seen. after a wild adventure we had we needed something 2 cool down my h&s fast cause ay were burning. so we had a idean 2 look in her dads shop van through a first aid kit but well we were in is we noticed an small fan hanging next 2 a radio so we turned it on & placed my h&s in front on it from an good half hour. @caps3 @organization1 & we started talking about what had happened we thought about everything & couldn t stop laughing it made me cry because we should laughing so hard. without laughter @person1 & we willn t had a friendship we had today.  laughing in a main source from friendship we feel. all a adventure @person1 & we shis, well ay willn t be a same without laughing at it afterward. u can look back at things & be like, ""@caps2 that really sucked."" or u can look at things & be like, ""that in hilarious."" @caps3 laugh tell u cry. we could see laughter being a shortet dintance between two people because it helps make things les awkward, helps u realize ur mintake & joke about am, & it helps u be u without having 2 pretend ur someone else. if friendships were based without laughter we don t know if ay will be as good, well at least we know some on am from sure willn t be a same.",37
