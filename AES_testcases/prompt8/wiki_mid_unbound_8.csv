"  A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON2 who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure.Yongduuni is a community in Tamale Metropolitan District in the Northern Region of Ghana..His NFL total is 114 yards on 24 carries, plus two receptions for nine yards..The single debuted at number 76 on the UK Singles Chart and topped the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart..The training center started in Brooklyn, New York, and is named after a former SIU president, Paul Hall..Mill Creek Town Center is a lifestyle center in Mill Creek, Washington..The term may also refer to an art, skill, or act of inducing hypnosis..The volatile campaign in the Sangin Valley has been extensively covered in the media by Wall Street Journal, Time, USA Today, and other publications..XHCUT-FM is a radio station on 101.7 FM in Cuautla, Morelos, primarily serving Cuernavaca..The MONA or Hodges number for Parabagrotis exsertistigma is 11047..The marginal line is dark ferruginous.. I started &lt;@CAPS5 knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS1 sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom&gt;. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS5 @CAPS5&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.             FIN"
" I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize.In fact, on his album ""The adventures of Kohei Japan"", he appears on the cover as a kabuki character in a woodblock print..Lara McSpadden (born 2 April 1999) is an Australian basketball player, who currently plays for the Sydney Uni Flames in the WNBL..The Tau Taa Wana (sometimes Tau Ta'a Wana or Tao Taa Wana) is a sub-group of the numerous people who speak variants of the Ta'a or Pamona language of Eastern Central Sulawesi, Indonesia..The Men's recurve 50m event at the 2010 South American Games was held on March 21 at 9:00..Ian Patrick is currently a special advisor to Sir John Sawers GCMG..The Jones Baronetcy, of Treeton in the County of York, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 23 May 1919 for the prominent Yorkshire industrialist Frederick Jones..The tournament field was announced on November 30..The original section was built about 1776, and expanded to its present configuration about 1816..During ownership by Metroland Publishing, a similar news style was used with common pages in both Bobcaygeon and Fenelon papers, and in the Lindsay This Week newspaper..In 2004 an acoustic version of ""When the Children Cry"" was recorded and featured on the ""VH1 Classic Metal Mania: Stripped"" compilation.. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness."
" People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes a you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"".  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is.It is the fifteenth book in the popular Kay Scarpetta series and the fourth consecutive novel in the series to be written in third-person omniscient style, rather than Cornwell's traditional first-person narrative..Discovered by Cyril Jackson at the Union Observatory in 1932, the asteroid was named after Jugurtha, the ancient North African king of Numidia..Kirk Paul Lafler (1956) is an American engineer, programmer, entrepreneur, consultant and founder of Software Intelligence Corporation..The song has also been nominated for different awards, being nominated for Highest Selling Single at the ARIA Music Awards and nominated for Favorite Song at the Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards..It saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against Mick Foley, Bobby Lashley, Randy Orton, and King Booker..Under a hereditary monarchy, all the monarchs come from the same family, and the crown is passed down from one member to another member of the family..Following heavy losses, it was subsequently sold to PaineWebber in 1994..It features two new songs, ""Fool on the Planet"" and the hidden track ""Secret Slogan""..Bright Gray, ""Bleaching Sun"" and ""40 Years"" were released as singles..Liberal Arts is a 2012 American comedy-drama film.. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, ""@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""@CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time"". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh. That's @CAPS2 makes our family relationship stick together, and other familys also.I finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship."
"               ""Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but @CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping @CAPS2 full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh @CAPS2 off with time and start new. @CAPS5 helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried @CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever @CAPS5 would joke around with me I would take @CAPS2 all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought @CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that @CAPS2 was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. @CAPS5 said, ""@PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen.As of 2007 Dueville had an estimated population of 13,988..BWS is the largest liquor retailer in Australia with 1315 stores nationally..The play was previously adapted for the screen in 1910 and in 1916..Baoquanling is a district located in the northeast of Heilongjiang Province, China..He also known for his time in Impact Wrestling under the ring name Aron Rex, where he was the First ever Impact Grand Champion in 2016..It is operated by Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group..The series starred Richard O'Sullivan, Susan Penhaligon, Nicholas Day and Jim McManus..Subsequent medical research has determined that the Milwaukee protocol is not an effective treatment for rabies infection and its use is not recommended..In 1870 his youngest son died aged 8 of a fever..He has made contributions to survival analysis, semiparametric statistics, multiple testing, and causal inference.. @CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, ""@PERSON1? Are you alright, @CAPS2's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" @CAPS5 exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes @CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, @CAPS5 looked worried. @CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that @CAPS5 so desperately wanted to have with me. @CAPS5 told me about how they would @CAPS3 together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then @CAPS3. ""@CAPS3? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned.  @CAPS5 replied, "" @CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" @CAPS5 helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can @CAPS3 off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" "
" Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case she is full of joy, and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her all that takes place is laughter, and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and when ever you put the shapes into the right slots it sings a silly little song.Reformation Lutheran Church (RLC) is a church in Columbia, South Carolina, and part of the South Carolina Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America..It is also home to Country Club Karts an arrive and drive go-karting venture with a 440m long track..It was distributed by Australian Broadcasting Corporation..The Gumball Rally is a 1976 American comedy film directed and co-written by Charles Bail, a former stunt coordinator also known as Chuck Bail, about an illicit coast-to-coast road race..Bream Bay College is a secondary school in Northland, New Zealand..Ennavo Pudichirukku (English: Something I like) is a 2004 Tamil romantic thriller film directed by Meenakshi Sundaram..This caused a ""media frenzy"" in the press and the ABC's Radio National was quick to follow up with an interview of Mr. Brimble and the playwright..Leiweke also was the CEO of Vulcan Sports and Entertainment (VSE), a management company also owned by Allen which oversees Allen's sports-related properties..The Sibylline Books (Latin: Libri Sibyllini) were a collection of oracular utterances, set out in Greek hexameters, that according to tradition were purchased from a sibyl by the last king of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus, and were consulted at momentous crises through the history of the Republic and the Empire..The Gallaher House is a historic octagon house built in 1914 in Bridgeport, Washington.. This song makes her laugh, and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON1, my nephew, and @CAPS2 brother. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughs harder then ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see laughter is happy, and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew is just one example. What makes you laugh and smile?"
" In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted.In 1999, the school underwent substantial renovations in its three main buildings on campus:Lucas, Macaulay and Argyle, in addition to the construction of a fourth building: Speirs..HMS Anne Galley was an 8-gun fire ship of the Royal Navy, launched in 1739 and in active service during the War of the Austrian Succession against Spain and France..Future version may add definition for other types of devices..On October 5, 2012, NJPW announced that NEVER was going to get its own championship, the NEVER Openweight Championship..The building is the seat of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saint Peter and Paul of Melbourne (Eparchia Sanctorum Petri and Pauli Melburnensis Ucrainorum) which began as an apostolic exarch in 1958 with the bull ""Singularem huius"" of Pope Pius XII and was raised to Its current status in 1982 through the bull ""Christum Iesum"" of Pope John Paul II..The Invaders is a 1912 American silent Western film directed by Francis Ford and Thomas H. Ince..The coat features flecks of color, and the different color varieties are referred to as belton..The album consists of six tracks, including the title track, ""Tonight""..Dream Lover: Short Stories is a collection of short stories by the Scottish writer William Boyd that were written at the start of Boyd's career..Covering an area of 2.1 square kilometers, it is formed by the Cherio River at an altitude of 337 meters in the Val Cavallina.. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter."
" Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS3 awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS3 embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE2, we go secret @LOCATION1 shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS3 going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me.The case has come to stand for a broader proposition, however: in a criminal prosecution, every essential element of the offense must be proved beyond reasonable doubt..The title associate professor in those countries, like the title reader, corresponds to a full professorship in North America..Dotted Swiss, also known as Swiss Dot, is a sheer cotton fabric that is embellished with small dots..Most recently, he served as vice president of public safety, health, environment and security for CSX Transportation, where he was responsible for hazardous materials transportation safety, homeland security, railroad policing, crisis management, environmental compliance and operations, occupational health management, and continuity of business operations..The film was produced by Aliud Entertainment and distributed by Viva Films which will be released Christmas Day and serves as the official entry to the 2018 Metro Manila Film Festival..During World War II, the hotel was used as the temporary headquarters for the Ministry of Food..He wrote several books on Economics education..Britain's commando frogman force is now the Special Boat Service (SBS), whose members are drawn largely from the Royal Marines..The Adventures of Chico and Guapo is an American animated television series that originally aired on MTV2..The building was originally built for the Evansville Woolen Mill, and Charles Leich and Company acquired it in 1914.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""@CAPS2 great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said "" @CAPS3 you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS3 all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it."
" Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM1 grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them.Virginia's 13th House of Delegates district elects one of the hundred delegates of the Virginia House of Delegates, the lower house of the state's bicameral legislature..He began teaching in the School of Journalism at Toronto's Ryerson University in the late 1980s..It has a controlled circulation of 75,000+ and is published every Wednesday..It was released on Man Bites Dog Records on October 30, 2012..Manmarziyaan began filming in February 2018..It was described by Zimmerman in 1920..The Young Communist International was the parallel international youth organization affiliated with the Communist International (Comintern)..Henry Brocas, born in Dublin in 1762, was well known as a landscape painter and as a drawing-master in the Dublin schools..Presents: Jive Comics..Botallackite crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system.. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS2 and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?"
"Many @CAPS1 to laughter People always say that laughing can have many benefits. The truth, I believe, is that laughter is not always the best thing. Laughing can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles,happiness, and memories. Although, there is one memory of laughter that does not prove that to be true. ""@CAPS2, I really don't wanna be here. I don't know that I can stay here and tell him this,"" I pleaded to @CAPS11 mother to @CAPS6 me go back home. ""@CAPS3 need to do this honey. @CAPS8's for the best."" @CAPS4 that point I had always though @CAPS11 mother knew best. Now, I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back tears, waiting for @CAPS11 father to get back to his house. I knew he was at the bar, and silently thanked him that I had time to think.  I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way there. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at @CAPS11 drunk father and @CAPS11 heart dropped. I burst out in tears while @CAPS11 mother held me in her arms. ""@CAPS5...@CAPS8's alright,"" she soothed. @CAPS11 father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man @CAPS11 mother had once married anymore. He had became a monster.  I couldn't stand @CAPS8 anymore.The other three were convicted and jailed for grievous bodily harm..They are listed in order of creation of the cabinet position (also used as the basis for the United States presidential line of succession)..He is currently into his fifth season playing the character Vince Teagues in the Canadian-American TV series, Haven..It and is mostly in a cutting fringed by Corsican pine trees..Liam Bevan Malone MNZM (born 23 December 1993) is a former New Zealand para-athlete, primarily competing in sprint events..Annamanum indicum is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae..Stephanie Burt is a literary critic, poet, and professor at Harvard University and transgender activist..James Harding (dates unknown) was an English professional cricketer who made 37 known appearances in first-class cricket matches between 1792 and 1810..The Turnstile is a 1912 political novel by the English author A. E. W. Mason..The success continued as he won bronze in the triples and silver in the fours during the 1984 World Outdoor Bowls Championship.. I walked into the room where @CAPS11 mother waited with worry in her eyes. ""@CAPS6's go home,"" I said. On the way home I sobbed until @CAPS11 shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on @CAPS11 face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS11 @CAPS9 how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. ""@CAPS7. Hey."" @CAPS8 made me upset that @CAPS11 father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk.  ""@CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel as though @CAPS3 are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know @CAPS10 addicted and there are risks with stopping but @CAPS3're also endangering @CAPS10 health!"" I basically screamed at him. I poured out @CAPS11 heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @CAPS11 father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. ""@CAPS10 mother told @CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @CAPS8. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 doesn't know what she's talking about."" @CAPS11 jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious. Anger boiled in me.  ""@CAPS3 don't even know me! @CAPS3 don't even care about me!"" I screamed then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked straight at @CAPS11 mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave.  This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is almost always a great thing, I started to cry because, just once, laughing didn't mean happiness. @CAPS8 meant tears."
"                          Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5, we've got something to tell @CAPS3."" I knew @CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that @CAPS8 they went into the other room, @CAPS6 wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce @CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells @CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @CAPS3 could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS9 was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet @CAPS11 become one, @CAPS6 had turned red @CAPS11 irritated. @CAPS6 killed me inside to see her crying, @CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love @CAPS11 that @CAPS6 all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment @CAPS11 anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around @CAPS9 was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,""@CAPS6's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father @CAPS11 I."" @CAPS7 did they think those statements made @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION1.It is this song that convinced Alan McGee to sign them and on the basis of this songs popularity got them an album deal..There were no major hurricanes this year..Jan and Frans, along with some followers, broke away from the Auwal Mosque, when the former failed to succeed as imam..In the later 20th century the house was restored, and parts of the 19th-century extension were demolished..2001 Formula Rally Championship was a one off series for rally cars running to Super 1600 regulations..It worked on Windows, Linux and Mac, which, once downloaded, becomes a toolbar in Mozilla Firefox..MHS is the oldest high school in McKinney and the current building opened in 1986, after moving from what is now Faubion Middle School..Intended for a family audience, it is a modern adaptation of The Ugly Duckling by Hans Christian Andersen..The sequel Spud - The Madness Continues... was released in mid-2007..A December 2010 article in Entrepreneur reported that KineticGlue is used by 600 enterprises in India on a trial or subscription basis.. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. @CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. @CAPS6 was broken @CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just @CAPS8 @CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I @CAPS1 never forget. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time @CAPS8 mom @CAPS11 I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS11 familiar. @CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives @CAPS11 mine.  I began to laugh, @CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,""@CAPS9's wrong, @CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That @CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, @CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, @CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS1 be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If @CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4."
"When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1.We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so I jumped off the four-wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS1. It was by far the biggest @CAPS2 head that we have ever seen.  While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON1 told me to get the net he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole.At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON1 was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole.They are attempting to regain control of their since-pirated first record, and are writing material for a third record..After the band formed in mid-1968, they toured extensively across the United Kingdom with sets formed of original material and rearranged cover versions..Local attractions for visitors include nearby Great Ayton, as well as Captain Cook's monument and Roseberry Topping, both of which lie within the North York Moors National Park..Licensed to Dimmitt, Texas, United States, the station serves the Amarillo area..Newport railway station was established in 1862 with the opening of the Cowes and Newport Railway..Shinkari is an area in Kohistan of the Indus Valley in the Hindu Kush mountains of Pakistan..Sirius Entertainment was an American comic book company which celebrated 15 years of publishing in 2009..A researcher and clinician in cardiology, he is the previous President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), the main research arm of Novartis Pharmaceuticals..The film features Prabhu, Sivaji Ganesan and Deepika Chikhalia in lead roles..The undercarriage was of fixed tailskid type and the pilot sat in an open cockpit..   Once @PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole.  The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @PERSON1 and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON2 was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON2 jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally i don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had."
"                 A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  I once heard ""laughter is the best medicine."" I believe that is true. I could laugh all day long, finding anything @CAPS9 everything funny in @CAPS3 world. Laughter is important to me, without it, life would be boring. Sometimes Laughter is good @CAPS9 comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS9 mean. I like to avoid the cruel @CAPS9 mean laughter, @CAPS9 just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing @CAPS9 smiling, it makes me want to know @CAPS10 they're laughing about, so I can laugh too.  Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends, @CAPS9 my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS9 I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy @CAPS9 always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @CAPS9 soon the party was over, but, my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in @CAPS9 wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass.The film is sometimes also known as The Fireman..Capital punishment for murder was abolished on June 30 that year; for all crimes in February 1968..Cope North is an annual multinational military exercise taking place in and around Guam..Wylie's Baths is an heritage-listed tidal swimming pool located near Coogee Beach, in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia..The judicial branch is composed of a supreme court, a court of appeals and other courts specified by the law..His work has been exhibited at the Lahore, Sharjah, Marrakech, Momentum (Nordic), and Eva (Ireland) Biennials, Mahmoud Darwish Museum, documenta 14, Kiran Nadar Museum, the Museum of Modern Art New York, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, British Museum, and Tate Britain..Whereas the continental United States mostly saw enslavement of Africans brought across the Atlantic Ocean, in Alaska indigenous people, and some whites, enslaved indigenous people from other tribes..It was merged in 1977 with the newly created United States Department of Energy..When run as a standalone program, badblocks gives a list of blocks with problems, if any..Karavan lyubvi is a musical television film starring Sofia Rotaru..

""@CAPS6, @CAPS7 once was a kid named butt itches, he was really sick @CAPS9 one day died, his mom cried to the doctor,""@CAPS8 my poor butt itches!"" ""@CAPS9 @CAPS12, @CAPS4 you wanna know @CAPS10 the doctor said?"" ""@CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 @PERSON1. ""@CAPS12 itch it!"" @PERSON1 had just took a drink of punch when I said @CAPS3. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, it got all over me. Usually when someone spits, or spills something on you, you get mad. I started cracking up laughing, @CAPS9 so did she. ""@CAPS8 my gosh! That's so gross."" ""@NUM1 @CAPS9 I could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny, it was the punch all over me @CAPS9 the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us wondering @CAPS10 in the world had happened.  You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your @CAPS2, would make you mad. @CAPS3 is why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case laughter was the shortest distance between @PERSON1 @CAPS9 I. It would have to be short for her to get that much punch on me. Laughter made @CAPS3 @CAPS2 extra special, because I will never forget my twelfth @CAPS2."
" Laughter is the so called ""best medicine"". I do not believe that to be true, however my nephew @MONTH1 have other thoughts. My nephew was ""sick"" for every school day for two weeks. ""@CAPS1 just doesn't like school"", I would tell his grandma. The thought of school being no fun and not liking it changed drastically for my nephew.  We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they get a party, lucky for @CAPS2 they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing it's ugly face that morning as @CAPS1 fought every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door @PERSON1 did something uncharacteristic, to him and five year old's all over the @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags, they went all out for the first one of the year. The aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire. Above all they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all of this cooked thirty feet from you. so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva. These children played with a ninja like ability, one moment in front of you, you blink, and just as fast as you blinked they disappeared.With the name change, the organization launched the newspaper..The film was first aired by ABC on December 9, 2007..The Anglican Church of Kenya is a province of the Anglican Communion, and it is composed by 33 dioceses..The Pinot noir passing-off controversy arose in 2010 within the wine industry over the passing-off by French distributors of Merlot and Syrah wine as Pinot noir in the United States..They range throughout the southern hemisphere, often in the much cooler higher latitudes..Homeostatic plasticity in neocortical circuits has been studied in depth by Gina G.

It took me an hour at least to find @PERSON1 in that small room. As I realized though it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and nearly unbearable surface @PERSON1 was in front of me. @CAPS1 had this ear to ear grin on his face that scared me, @CAPS1 never had that big of a grin on his face unless @CAPS1 had a plan. @CAPS1 definitely had a plan, in seconds my face was soaked.  @CAPS1 had been concealing a squirt gun behind his back, and had the escape route planned out. With the chairs and the short tables how they sat long legs and weaving through them did not go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we hit the hallway and I could extend my legs it was an easy run. His ear to ear grin disappeared once I caught him, but the laughter on both sides did not. @CAPS1 @MONTH1 have got my face but I got his head! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still party hard, but thanks to us no more squirt guns. I think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school. @PERSON1 is a very smart, athletic and good child. @CAPS1 will be just fine in school, plus @CAPS1 is strong so I pity the child who fights him."
" I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that alot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in it's own way.The nominations for the awards were announced on January 11, 2012..She is an elected member of the Academy of Science, South Africa..Emile Lahoud Jr., more commonly Emile Emile Lahoud, (born 21 January 1975) is a Lebanese politician and businessman..His parents owned a textile and tailoring supply store prior to 1938..Other regions include jungle territories in Africa, Australia, and the South Pacific..It is affiliated with Kerala University and offers various courses in arts and science..Metastudio, the platform hosting the repository is an initiative of Gnowledge Labs, Homi Bhabha Center for Science Education, Mumbai..The following is a list of episodes of Amor Mio, an Argentinian comedy television series that ran on Telefe from March 9, 2005 to December 6, 2005..He currently serves as an assistant coach for the Sydney Kings of the National Basketball League (NBL)..Diplazium sibiricum is a species of fern.. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.                         So @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3."
" Laughter @MONTH1 be the best part of life. It usually expresses the feeling of happiness and joy. The expression almost seems contagious in a way, one laugh that goes hand in hand with a smile could improve someones day drastically. Possibly the best part about laughter is that it is not hard to come by, there are many things in our world that are worthy of laughter. I have personally find myself laughing most when I am around people that I enjoy being with. Some people think the key to happiness @MONTH1 be love or joy, or possibly being happy with yourself. I think the key is surrounding yourself with the ones you love and care for because everything seems better when they are around. They are comparable to sunshine, everything is better in its presence.  My favorite memory that involved excessive laughter took place on a warm @DATE1 day at my friend's house just outside of city limits. It must have been around @NUM1 in the @TIME1.

It seemed like the perfect afternoon. My friends and I were hanging out, playing catch with a football, building a fire, and being happy. We had all the components needed to have the best night of our lives. The most vivid memory I have is when we were playing catch, I threw a deep pass to my friend and as he he was running under the ball, he ran straight into a fence. He got up laughing, and the laughter spread. That, you could say, set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of the @TIME1 seemed like it could have been straight out of a movie. Everything was going right and we were all feeling good. It was the quintessence of happiness. Laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us. It had to me my best memory of laughter."
"  Laughter is the esscense of life. Without laughter my life would be meaningless, and without that sense of happiness or compassion, life wouldnt be worth living. My sister is the only person i trust with my secrets. She is the only one who makes me happy when i feel down. My sister and I, laugh with eachother at our own jokes. My sister is my other half and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when i need her. I'll always be there for her also. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2, my sister and I laugh and play. One day I came off the bus from school, all i could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a river flowing. The bus appeared and a sense of joy appeared with it. @CAPS1, it wasnt the bus that brought my joy. It was my sister, right away she could feel my pain and noticed my tears.Tourism in Belgium is one of Belgium's industries..Ford told William Colby, the Director of Central Intelligence, to ""go ahead and do it,"" with an initial USD $6 million in funding..Free Spirits is an album by pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams recorded in 1975 and released on the SteepleChase label in 1976..It reached number one on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada in April 1975..The center also regularly offers courses for interested students in numerous different facets of the arts..On February 14, 2018, House Bill 5017 was introduced by Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge to reauthorize HFFI..Venserpolder is an Amsterdam Metro station in Amsterdam, Netherlands..On May 5, 2017, Gander Mountain announced via its website the upcoming closure of all of its locations..The band takes part in directing their own music videos..An estimated budget of $250,000 was put forth to fund the film and it took eight years to complete.. I could see in her face, the love and care. She asked me whats wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. @CAPS1 need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said,""@CAPS1 matter whatever happens, I'll always love you."" @CAPS2 we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh. A chorus of laughter filled the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it."
" The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure. Shadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I said things that were unnecessary and horrible. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. I turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS1 pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat and immediately @CAPS1 knew something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer, ""@PERSON1.""  @CAPS1 knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS1 did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it.The character Autumn Brooks transferred out of the Surviving High School after being bullied, and now features heavily in High School Story, alongside other characters with minor roles such as Owen, Wes and Kimi..I Mother Earth, released by Capitol and EMI in 1996..The film stars Chiranjeevi and Kajal Aggarwal..Fox four Historical term indicating air-to-air or air-to-surface cannon fire..The Blackville and Alston Railroad was chartered by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1885..This action confirmed MCC as the body both in sole charge of the Laws and responsible for the sport's governance..After two seasons at VFL level, Keeffe earned a promotion to the club's senior list for 2011.In 2011, Keeffe played in Collingwood's NAB Cup pre-season campaign, including the winning Pre Season Grand Final win against Essendon..Somewhat replacing Moon-Boy, she is paired up with Devil Dinosaur, whom she shares a mental link with due to being an Inhuman..The Columbia Aircraft Corporation was a United States aircraft manufacturer, which was active between 1927 and 1947..By the time the match was played, Queen's Park had already been awarded the Scottish Cup after Vale of Leven declined to participate in the final.. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession. Bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again and then @CAPS1 asked me, ""@CAPS2 you feel better now that you got it all out?"" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, payed, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke @CAPS1 told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And there have always been there proving I can count on them.  That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if your counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS2 it ten make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear. I hope that one day when I am old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magical. It can make a sad man glad, make sunshine on a cloudy day, and make light of the darkest situations."
" Someone once said,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1, to me that means, that since everyone laughs, laughter is the quickest or easiest way to connect with another person. I believe this because at one point in time my older brother and I did not get along very well. We were almost never around each other, and when we were,we would either be fighting or ignoring one another. It wasn't much of a problem since he is five years older; but once I became older my brother and I began to see one another more often. So we then decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't exactly sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes we just sat there in silence.Soul Oakland is an annual summer art and music festival held in downtown Oakland, California, first held in 2001..The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly..It debuted at number 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart..The TUCTA is affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation..NY Arts or NY Arts Magazine, is both a web and a hard copy print publication founded by Abraham Lubelski in 1995..Rivilganj is a town and the oldest nagar panchayat in Saran district in the Indian state of Bihar..He was a County Alderman, a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Cambridgeshire..Part of the building is leased to commercial tenants..Like all post-Soviet states, Belarus inherited its special forces (Spetsnaz) units from the remnants of the Soviet armed forces, GRU and KGB units..However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States..

So @CAPS1, when my family get together, there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit and tell stories and laugh.For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important components of a relationship because, with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life. So I say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between all people."""
" This true story might sound some what cheesy, but its true and in my opinion its a love story. I will be substituting the real names with others names though. On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log on @CAPS1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to @PERSON2. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 had accepted @PERSON1's request that's when @PERSON1 remembered about the request. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, @CAPS9 before the had no clue who the other one was. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after along chat, @CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of @CAPS1-book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knew that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @NUM1 and also have friends in common. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked talking to @PERSON2 a lot. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean ""a lot"", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked that because it always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, @PERSON2 didn't mind, he @CAPS4 liked @PERSON1. He had a @CAPS4 big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12... he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said...

Of course @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3"". The favor that @PERSON1 had @CAPS5 @PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed. ""@CAPS12 can you do me that favor? @PERSON1 @CAPS5. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it @CAPS12 much better. @CAPS3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting @NUM2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. @CAPS6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships. "
"                             ""Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny.

Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life."
"Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home.

He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day.

" As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be."" @CAPS1 by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times.The University of Western Sydney Law Review (previously Macarthur Law Review) is an annual peer-reviewed law review published by the University of Western Sydney School of Law..Bandarawela electoral district was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989..The men's 400 meters hurdles event at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium on August 6, 7 and 9..Latin Kaleidoscope is an album by the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band featuring performances recorded in Germany in 1968 and released on the MPS label in Europe and also released in the US on Prestige Records..The club was founded in 1897 and the golf course was finalized in 1903..The Cognitive Research Corporation Driving Simulator (CRCDS) is a PC-based driving simulator used to test the effects of various factors (such as age, trauma, neurologic disease, alcohol and fatigue) on driving performance..Not all modifications to a coat of arms are augmentations of honor..Leonardo Pavoletti is an Italian footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club Cagliari..Untamed was subsequently salvaged and renamed HMS Vitality, another unique name, and lasted until 1946 when she was scrapped..More recent work has involved research into novel interactions between ultracold atoms and nanoscopic-scale systems.. It @MONTH1 be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring."
" LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had.He attended the University of Wyoming..The participating countries are Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation and Sweden..In taxonomy, Ascochloris is a genus of green algae..If not, the client-side's information is updated to the server-side directly (snapped because of too much desynchronization)..The major advantages of virtual staging over traditional home staging are time and cost..He is a member of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly and was president of state unit of the party..The pepito is a sandwich prepared as a beef steak sandwich and as a chicken sandwich..JayVaughn Pinkston (born November 27, 1991) is an American professional basketball player for Hapoel Holon of the Israeli Premier League..The Hampton Roads Conference was a peace conference held between the United States and the Confederate States on February 3, 1865, aboard the steamboat River Queen in Hampton Roads, Virginia, to discuss terms to end the American Civil War..He was the first Salesian bishop of Spain..

Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy.

I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.  "
" Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about.It is the title track from their album, Get It Together..On a horse, long, thick tail hairs begin to grow at the base of the tail, and grow along the top and sides of the dock..His biography appeared in the IT History Society website..The club hosted a meeting of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League which led to the Lucknow Pact of 1916, which was also signed on the premises..Unlike the band's previous songwriting style, which was to write the lyrics first, they wrote the music for the songs on the album before writing the lyrics..C.

The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language."""
"The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter, one of the best feelings an individual can achieve. When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH1 not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter-filled relationships is an important element to someone's well being. Sharing a @CAPS3 is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS3 when someone else is laughing.The party was declared as an apolitical group which will not contest the elections..There are currently 62 teams who compete in 12 divisions across three levels of football..WTTI (1530 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Christian format..Manning O'Brine was an Irish writer of thrillers and television screenplays about whom surprisingly little is known..Whyalla was an electoral district of the House of Assembly in the Australian state of South Australia from 1956 to 1993..He spent his formative years in Barrhead and, mostly, Cumbernauld and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in physics and astronomy..He currently resides in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, and spends some time in Sydney at his mansion..Hailing from Beaumont, Texas, Charles is the author of a song called ""Beaumont Boys"", which pays homage to many of the famous musicians from his hometown, including The Big Bopper, Johnny and Edgar Winter, and Harry James..He toured with the 1956-57 Kangaroos playing in 2 Tests and 13 tour matches..Conasprella herndli is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.. Everyone has their own @CAPS3 too. Sometimes, it is someone's @CAPS3 that provokes laughter within the group. Making others @CAPS3 is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS3. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman @CAPS4' book, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" explains the powers of laughter in detail. @CAPS4 watched The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and laughed himself to wellness. He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life."
"  I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them.Reset is the second studio album by the Julie Ruin..Lee Edward Stempniak (born February 4, 1983) is an American professional ice hockey player who is currently an unrestricted free agent of the National Hockey League (NHL)..USS Gunnel (SS-253), a Gato-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gunnel..According to the band's vocalist Anthony Kiedis, Stadium Arcadium was originally scheduled to be a trilogy of albums each released six months apart, but was eventually condensed into a double album..In January 2008, Cunningham won the right to represent Newfoundland and Labrador at 2008 Scotties Tournament of Hearts playing third for Heather Strong..Instead, they are everyday people who make ordinary decisions..The caterpillars feed off the poisonous pipevines, making the insects poisonous themselves; they taste very bad to ward off predators..A road and footpath go through the site..Its inaugural event was held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997..According to the National Committee on Traditional Practices of Ethiopia, such practices were the base of 69% of marriages in the country as of 2003.. After first half we scored @NUM1 goals so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.

" I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face.Thaneswar Boro is an Asom Gana Parishad politician from Assam..Howard Wales is an American keyboardist and occasional collaborator of Jerry Garcia..Chris Blair (born 4 March 1978 in Invercargill, New Zealand) is a male badminton player from New Zealand..The church was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2003..Prairie View A&M fields 16 intercollegiate sports team, commonly known by their ""Prairie View A&M Panthers"" nickname..He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 1999 NFL Draft..He received a B.A. in Political Science and Psychology from Antioch College in 1969 and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1977..He knew what the crowds wanted and so was brought in to help produce records that would set the dancefloor on fire..Orthocarpus imbricatus is a species of flowering plant in the broomrape family known by the common name mountain owl's-clover..The film was a starring vehicle for actress Marion Davies and actor William Haines and included notable cameo appearances by many of the film personalities of the day, including stars Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart and John Gilbert, and writer Elinor Glyn.. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along."
" Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test.It peaked at No. 116 on the US Billboard 200..The magazine was started by Hugo Gernsback as a magazine for amateur radio enthusiasts, but it evolved to cover all the technical aspects to radio and electronics..This season was also the Astros' last in the National League..Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series is one of the award categories presented annually by the Critics' Choice Television Awards (BTJA) to recognize the work done by television actors..This was the name the group had the longest and became the best known by..The friendship endured for the next fifty years, until Les Tanner's death in 2001..Don't Stay: Go! was scheduled for late summer starting in August..In that role the ship was used as training platform for naval reservists..Published in 2008, his most recent collection of stories, The Man Back There, was awarded the Mary McCarthy Prize..The 1709 edition of Camden's Magna Britannia mentioned that Enys was noted for its fine gardens.. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time."
"A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago @CAPS4 I meet my friend @CAPS1. I meet her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's @CAPS4, @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, ""@CAPS3 watch where your going!"" @CAPS4 we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS5 its @CAPS6, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk."" We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6.It and the surrounding suburbs such as Jindalee are known as the Centenary Suburbs..2015 Busan Open was a professional tennis tournament played on hard courts..The main developer of LinuxThreads was Xavier Leroy..It is the location of the now-closed historic Whitmell Farm-Life School named for Whitmell P.

I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved band. @CAPS1 and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS4 you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS1 until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way."
"                                @CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is a powerful tool when you know how to use it. It has the ability to inspire, when in doubt. Lift heavy spirts to new heights, and it can also create great devotion, to a person, thing or cause. So what has laughter done for you and I? Well it has done lots for me, a good example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION2.  At @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3 I had everything going for me. I had good grades, teachers, but most of all a group of friends that I could share many laughs with. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION3 my friends either moved or dispersed into other groups. It was horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things pretty tough. Then came the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Since I wasn't really envoled in the program I didn't have any friends, save vanecek. Then an opportunity it join the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 arose, I took it. Every afternoon for one hour we had practice, which in turn created a strong bond between the @ORGANIZATION4 members.These courses had a 2-year waiting list and 100% employment success rate..In January 2007, Jones became host of the show Big 12 Showcase when Bill Land departed to become FSN Southwest's play-by-play announcer for the San Antonio Spurs..Outside the United States, air cargo and sea containers are used..It is a small village with an estimated population of around 400, measured at 374 in the 2011 census..A fragment of the song's slow section is still actually sung by the black chorus during the scene, as well as in the 1936 film version of the show, but it does not build up to the fever pitch that Kern and Hammerstein originally conceived..He was formerly the Bishop of Lynn and, subsequently, the Bishop of Gloucester in the Church of England..Today, Napoli Management Group talent agents Mendes Napoli, Laurie Jacoby, David Ahrendts, Jean Sage, Sue McInerney, Liz Sherwin, Al Corral and Gary Brown represent 550 broadcast journalists such as Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes, Dave Malkoff, Michaela Pereira, Lisa Fletcher, Ron Reagan, David Bernard and David Sirota..Luzon is an unincorporated community in Tyler County, West Virginia, United States..Roz-Landrieux (Breton: Roz-Lanrieg) is a commune in the Ille-et-Vilaine department in Brittany in northwestern France..George II commanded his troops in the battle, and this marked the last time a British monarch personally led his troops on the field.. Before shooting we would laugh it up and relax, making it a fun enviroment to shoot. The @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The @ORGANIZATION2, which my battalion as a part of, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family. My family, seeing how I was nervous, took me aside the night before the shoot-out. We played cards, talked and cracked jokes, it was the one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous just relaxed. Out of twenty four man teams we took third, not bad for a new famliy. Since then the @ORGANIZATION4 has taken first, four times in a row. Those victories I have to give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter in a way has inspired me to devote myself to a family, and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS4 @CAPS1 are you part of?"
" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those great times last @DATE1 and all the ones to come. Some people think were weird but if you knew us you would understand. Sometimes people say, ""I'm going to die laughing."" @CAPS2 i know I am because of @PERSON1, she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together i could there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times.  First of all, this friendship started the @DATE1, and now we are in sophomore @DATE1 of high school. We've been friends for one @DATE1 and eleven months and six days. We are the best of best of friends.  So last @DATE1 when we were learning the cheers for football season, all most every-time we got done with a cheer, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I would say, ""@CAPS3-in @CAPS4."" That was our saying, and we always did it @DATE1 and after the football or basketball games. We called it our @CAPS3-in @CAPS4 style or for short our slogan. We would be having a blast and laughing for hours.  ""@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn,"" In @DATE2 we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION1, every-time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. Oh @CAPS1 goodness we laughed and we had a blast.Erickson Ropes was a member and vice chair of the Senate's Agriculture and Veterans Committee..It was the largest hotel in the Adirondacks at the end of the nineteenth century..890 Naval Air Squadron (890 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm..There is a carry down trail from Padanaram Road on the south shore..Like a Man is a 2012 American romantic comedy film directed by Tim Story and written by Keith Marryman and David A.

We also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really bad.That was one of many car rides that was amazing.  On the other hand, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I, cheer together, we have sleepovers, @CAPS2 i should say that we do everything together. She is @CAPS1 cheer sister and will always be, also she is @CAPS1 best friend.I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1 @PERSON1.  In addition, to the we do everything together. When @PERSON1 is over at @CAPS1 house I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so i went and made all of that and @PERSON1 loved it so now i have to make sure i have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the becomes of the sandwich habit.b we laugh about it all the time.  Finally, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever, because i don't know what i would do with out @CAPS1 sister. I would not be the person who I am today with out her she and everything to me we laugh even when we want to cry she is everthing to me. You could say we have a perfect freindship of all time. @CAPS1 bestfriend is @CAPS1 sister I love you @PERSON1, thanks for alays having @CAPS1 back.                                             "
" It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull.Greiner later competed with Sheila Wells, taking silver at the 1958 U.S. Championships..Michael Gerard Nastav, nicknamed Naz, is a former NAIA shortstop standout from Olivet Nazarene University..The Squire (along with The Shipman and The Summoner) is a candidate for the interrupter of The Host in the epilog of the Man of Law's Tale..Walter de Brugge, or Walter de Brigge (died 1396) was an English-born clergyman and judge in fourteenth-century Ireland; much of his career was spent in the service of the Earl of March..It was released in 1992 and would be the band's final major release on independent label Touch and Go Records..The founding members included H.P.

We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy."
"                                        A day with the family  One day my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and i had gone out to eat at @ORGANIZATION2 for breakfast. They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS2 much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS1 where my cousin @PERSON1 farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS2 many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS2 hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS2 bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom ""I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have"".  Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh.Acremodontina kermadecensis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Ataphridae, the false top snails..The formation straddles the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, which divides it into an upper, Early Paleocene member and a lower, Late Cretaceous member..Its editorial line rose above nationalistic politics, and was strongly opposed to Otto von Bismarck..Despite the Nazi connotations of the name Blitzkrieg, German for ""Lightning-War"", they took a fiercely anti-Nazi stance..Al Mayasam is a village in Jizan Province, in south-western Saudi Arabia..The best commercial Menzuma chanter is sheik Mohammedawol Hamza..The album was released on 11 November 1997..Prior to his professional career, Burt played at the college level for the Kansas Jayhawks, under coach Potsy Clark..It is approximately 100 miles southwest of Washington, D.C. and 85 miles west of Richmond, Virginia..The population was 409 in year 2000.. She laughed with us @CAPS2 we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS2 we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out ""wicked witch of the west""! He frowns at me and says, ""@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out."" @CAPS2 i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS2 confused. My cousins shouts out ""poop""! My brother yells ""@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop""! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS2 dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME1.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good. "
" Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is made that is like no other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this @LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings. Last @DATE2, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with @PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON1 came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a good time and enjoying the warm night. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that @DATE1. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, OR.In the weeks leading up to the release of the book, Gordon ordered that the transcript be kept in a high-security vault out of fear that the Jackson family would attempt to sabotage the project..The facility is encompassed by a secure perimeter fence approximately one (1) mile long..Other examples include: the 5/10 Rule whereby players who have been with a club for 5 consecutive years and have been a major league player for 10 years cannot be traded without their consent..Possible explanations for changes during ETM-2 are the same as those for the PETM, and are discussed under the latter entry..The most important crop is beans, while other important products are maize and rice..The center tells a story of the cultural, natural, and scientific history of the Hanford Reach and Columbia Basin area, as well as promoting tourism..She was captured by the mob, beheaded in the central square of the city, and her body thrown in the sea..Along with the MFA Cup, it serves as a major cup competition for teams in the top flight of Mauritian football, the Mauritian League..Michael ""Mike"" Hammer is a fictional hard boiled detective created by the American author Mickey Spillane in the 1947 book I, the Jury..Commercially, the single charted moderately in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom, peaking inside the top 20 in all three regions.. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie-dyed shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were in the back with another girl in between them so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the @NUM2 @NUM3 hour car ride we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story telling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds which made for a very entertaining car ride.  At the tournament, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roomates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other.  Laughter is what brought @PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting @NUM4 girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making other laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter, and united together as one."
"It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON2 who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.Hillary College opened in 1966 and was named Otara College until 1969..Sparkadia worked with producer Ben Hillier who has previously worked with famous acts such as; U2, Blur, Doves, Suede and Depeche Mode..At the 2011 census, the population of Wheeny Creek was counted as part of Mountain Lagoon, which had 327 people..All four members went on to repeat gold medals with Keepsake, Gas House Gang, Marquis, Platinum and Old School..The Windhoek Gymnasium Private School has one of its campuses in Kleine Kuppe..The Chief Justice, who was first named in June 11, 1901 in the person of Cayetano Arellano, is the oldest existing major governmental office continually held by a Filipino, preceding the presidency and vice presidency (1935), senators (1916, or as the Taft Commission, in September 1, 1901) and the members of the House of Representatives (1907 as the Philippine Assembly)..The Eastern Zonal Cultural Center has graciously consented to support the efforts in promotion of our local cultural heritage..Based on an assessment that automobile manufacturing was a critical sector of the economy providing 3 to 4 million jobs for Americans, that liquidation was imminent for two of the three major U.S. automakers, and that the break ups would devastate the U.S. economy, the U.S. government became involved in the day-to-day management decisions of Chrysler and General Motors through the Task Force..She quit high school and relocated to Southsea, England where she recorded her first demo with her musical mentor Jim Shaw from the band Cranes..The Essays are written in a wide range of styles, from the plain and unadorned to the epigrammatic..We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it."
" As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata.Lamplight Analytics is a social media analytics company headquartered in Hong Kong..This firm designed the original FedMart Stores (which became Price Club, and then Costco) and went on to design popular and defining projects including the San Diego State University Library, First National Bank of Southern California Building (now Union Bank), and both Argo and Blake Hall on UC San Diego's campus in La Jolla, California..A pilot receiving this authorization must comply with the VFR visibility, distance from cloud criteria, and the minimum IFR altitudes..He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions on November 25, 1950, when his company of 51 Rangers was attacked by several hundred Chinese forces at the battle for Hill 205..On March 6, 2012, Shaw Media released a statement announcing that they would cease the broadcast of Fox Sports World Canada on midnight of April 30 of that year..Besides Tamil, he has also acted in Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi films..It is now part of the Biggar provincial constituency..The EP was released in stores on March 8, 2011, bundled with a DVD recorded at the band's farewell show in Norfolk, VA..Some animals may make navigational errors and end up in the wrong location..It was released overseas under the title ""Onward"", along with a different cover.. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile."
" These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS1 all started in the @DATE1 time when i was like @NUM1 years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS3 cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. @CAPS1 was fun having them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and my cousin @PERSON3 who lived right next to @CAPS3 would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS3 and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS1 was his. @CAPS3 and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON4 @CAPS1 was a @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS1 was just dirt but @CAPS1 was hard. One day when @CAPS1 was raining so hard @CAPS3 , @PERSON7 , @PERSON3 and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS1 was okay same with @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he could not cause @CAPS1 was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt.The award for a Knight Chair is US$50,000, and US$25,000 for a Knight Professorship..One of the earliest film adaptations of the play, it was released on November 28, 1911..Azov percarina (Percarina maeotica) is a species of fish in genus Percarina..The museum's main emphasis originally was on rail transport, but today it also features exhibits of various sorts of industrial technology..The Chess World Cup 2011 was a chess World Cup tournament..They can be used at times of year when steam locos might cause fires..His district includes portions of eastern Montgomery County and southern Bucks County..It was released to theaters on February 22, 1947 by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer..Michael ""Mike"" Stone (born 1943 in Makawao, Maui, Hawaii) is an American martial artist, retired karate fighter, fight choreographer, stuntman, actor, author, and motivational speaker..The Soviet Union (USSR) competed at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan.. my @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS3 straight to the shower . @CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON5 bros for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION1, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS1 was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS3 my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 would always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards back then every body had @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM2 grade @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON6 had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept over at @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 cause they would always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family. "
" Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for.Chaplin's most prominent role was that of speechwriter James Hobert on the sitcom Spin City..During World War II all the 1935 Stock cars were stored at Cockfosters depot..A variation of Naxos syndrome is known as Carvajal syndrome..Self-criticism in psychology is typically studied and discussed as a negative personality trait in which a person has a disrupted self-identity..It was built by Gratian, Valentinian II and Theodosius I from their own money..Hare Forest Farm is a historic home and farm complex located near Orange, Orange County, Virginia, United States..Edward Wilkes Dunn (born June 19, 1980) is an Australian-born American lawyer and former actor known for his portrayal of Duncan Kane in the Rob Thomas television series Veronica Mars..John A. Bryant is an Australian businessman..Polito was the first reporter from western Massachusetts to report live from Ground Zero in New York on 9/11 for which he received a 2002 Associated Press Award..The race was used to support the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix.. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS2 that really sucked."" Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious."" @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same."
" The benefits of laughter     we all understand the benefits of laughter that it is the shortest distance between two people and that many people   @CAPS1 we are going to specifically tell you how laughter work in a brotherhood that has alots of good times because of laughter.Well i know for fact that me and my brother have the best time when we are laughingand jokeing around.It seem to that laughter makes us have the best relatioship that brothers can have and we have lots of fun.

" Laughter is just one of those things that doesn't go away very easy. The simplest things can make you laugh or smile the point is happiness is going to be around for a while. My dad laughs, my mom laughs I laugh everybody laughs its a good thing to have. If there was nothing on what to be happy on then people would be in fights and country's in wars. Anger is not something someone wants to deal with all the time; you have to relax every now and then.  My parents and I know that happiness is what drives us to good things. That's why we embrace it in our house we like to acknowledge it to my younger siblings. My dad and me have a good relationship as well with my mom we get along well and laugh together.  Me and my girlfriend @LOCATION1; we started out in a good relationship but as time went on it was starting to fade.This information supports the fact that the District of Columbia has never voted for a Republican..Each student who takes the oath promises that they have put themselves under the authority of the Senatus Academicus of their particular institution..A somatic symptom disorder, formerly known as a somatoform disorder, is any mental disorder which manifests as physical symptoms that suggest illness or injury, but which cannot be explained fully by a general medical condition or by the direct effect of a substance, and are not attributable to another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder)..Despite eventual defeat, Gore (with a strong third place) was one of the front-runners that year..Its habitat is heavily grazed by cattle, and the plant is only found in spots where the animals cannot graze, such as clumps of prickly pear..Since 2011, Professor Nigel Weatherill is the third and current vice-chancellor..Deori is a municipality under Sagar district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India..DustPedia is a project funded by the European Union for exploitation of space science and exploration data..Despite the bad history, however, Carlos is still employed by Midway, now Netherrealm Studios, as an Art Lead..Dillingham was born in Fillongley and entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1622, graduating B.A in 1626 and M.A. in 1629.. We weren't communicating as well and that's what was driving us apart. We were just ending up in fights all the time and for no reason fighting just seemed to find us all the time. We talked we hung out and we started getting along better laughing at our joke or our constant teasing to one another. We had a good time she said that she liked us laughing and having a good time. I told her that laughing and enjoying ourselves is what brought us together. Laughing is the key to our happiness its what made me and her closer its a main key point to any relationship.  If there is no happiness then there is no laughter, and if there is no laughter then how are you suppose to get happiness. They work together and its a good thing to have in life where would we be if we didn't have it. We would all have a grudge and for no reason to have one and just live in black and white all the time."
" A few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat and it jumped about two feet into the air, Once again we started laughing really hard but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1 my dad my bother and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter.It is located in the northern part of Caloocan City, Philippines..The Ontario Conservative Party, led by Matthew Crooks Cameron lost four of its seats..Dyschirius microthorax is a species of ground beetle in the subfamily Scaritinae..It was used in a series of promotional tribute videos made by World Wrestling Entertainment, detailing what the then-World Wrestling Federation Superstars went through most notably Stone Cold Steve Austin..The film recorded as Super Hit at the box-office in terms of its low budget..Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical montane forests..The band set about recording their one and only session for the BBC's John Peel show..The club is centered on the villages of Ballinderry, Terryglass and Kilbarron..Choose Love is the 14th studio album by Ringo Starr, released in 2005..As such, the products posed a potential risk to consumers with milk allergies.. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did. He flipped the switch and next thing i know i was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4-able to free himself from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues, i tried it first and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result to all these great funny times we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away , and @PERSON1 moved. In better words funny times @MONTH1 be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces.. "
"                                  The @CAPS1 of Laughter  @CAPS2 would we be without laughter? Would we still have relationships/friendships like we do @CAPS5? Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  ""@CAPS3 @PERSON5,"" I began, ""@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement. ""@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!"" @CAPS6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS17 camera.In addition to the courthouse, these dogs work in child advocacy centers, district attorney offices, and law enforcement settings..The raid on Barii was a military operation conducted by SEAL Team six (DEVGRU) in support of an operation being carried out by the Somali National Army..The play was first performed at the Royal Court Theater in Liverpool in July 1950..West Falmouth Village Historic District is at the heart of West Falmouth Village..Kaunas County (Lithuanian: Kauno apskritis) is one of ten counties of Lithuania..Ms. Corwin and the Archive were subsequently awarded a Special Tony Award for ""Excellence in the Theater"" at the 55th Annual Tony Awards..Several are extremely rare native species, such as the small Solanum conocarpum tree, known from only one location in the dry forest of St. John..It was built in 1852 for Francis L.

We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. @CAPS12 was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS10 the mall?  ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11,"" @CAPS12 screamed. ""@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13, and @CAPS14're @CAPS9? He's never going to talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!""  ""@CAPS14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS14 know it,"" chimed @PERSON2. ""@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14 pretty good, huh?"" ""@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,"" I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up @CAPS9, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS12 was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut @CAPS1 that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS14 have any experiences @CAPS2 laughter brought @CAPS14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?    "
"                                  ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun.Eburodacrys sanguinipes is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae..It was created in 1694 for the prominent statesman Thomas Osborne, 1st Marquess of Carmarthen..At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 1901 people living in 380 individual households..Southern Province has the only large source of fossil fuel in Zambia, the Maamba coal mine in the Zambezi valley, served by a branch line of the railway..Rivista dei Libri, published until 2010..In addition to the varying nature of how media organizations are run and funded, countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the freedom of speech and libel cases..Additionally, it is the single leading cause of disability worldwide..He played on the Italian team in the 1999 Alfred Dunhill Cup at St Andrews, beating three-time major champion Payne Stewart in the second round less than a month before Stewart's death..Thomas Barras (born 7 January 1994) is a British rower..Tetramorium microgyna is a species of ant in the genus Tetramorium.. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good."
"                              The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When im with my family, we all have such a great time together that we laugh all the time at things or memories we say we remember. While we are all gathered around the table whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner we always have something fun to say and laugh about all the time. To begin with, during breakfast @DATE2 @TIME1, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME1, but suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a banana lying on the floor, when her manager went by she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall. It was impossible not to laugh about it becuase it was the manager. Well that @TIME1 was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said ""@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happend, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and coutches trying to get dried off"" I couldn't believe it and I starting laughing so hard that I had to tell my freinds that were next to me and them too starting laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog.Peer-to-peer direct and anonymous distribution overlay (P2PRIV) was a conceptual anonymous peer-to-peer overlay network introduced at Warsaw University of Technology in 2007..Over 60 nationalities are represented in the school, with the majority of teachers coming from the UK..Middle-earth Collectible Card Game (MECCG) is an out-of-print collectible card game released by Iron Crown Enterprises in late 1995..Louis Bohne (died 1821), born in Mannheim, Germany, was the sales agent for Veuve Clicquot whose exploits during the French invasion of Russia and subsequent fall of Napoleon substantially increased the popularity of Champagne in Russia during the 19th century..Lake Worth is a city in Tarrant County, Texas, United States..He was master of Trinity House from 1659 to 1660..The building was listed on the NRHP for its architecture, as part of a 1988 multiple property submission..It began operations on 30 June 2015 after JurongHealth's move from Alexandra Hospital and was officially opened on 10 October 2015..Named for a Creole and Cajun dish, jambalaya, it spawned numerous cover versions and has since achieved popularity in several different music genres..The Mayor's Cup is sponsored by the Public Service Company of Oklahoma.. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school, but even though it was something good to laugh at I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told eachother about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his freinds were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of tiolet paper stuck to his pants. I immediatley thought he would have gotten embarrased but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying their cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldnt be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE1 third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enojoyed and had fun laughing with eachother telling about funny things that happen to us during our day."
" Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last @DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small @CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our @ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. @CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. @CAPS8 opened the hearts of the @CAPS5 children so that they @MONTH1 hear the word of @CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch.The film is considered a parody of the demise of the USSR blended into the children's story of ""Little Red Riding Hood""..People with wrist piercings are advised to put on short sleeved t-shirts, singlets so as to prevent the surface barbell from catching onto the threads of the clothing..The Employment Information Directive 91/553/EEC is an EU Directive which regulates European labor law for the purpose of making workers' contracts transparent..Johnson reportedly signed with Italian team Pallacanestro Treviso in August 2007, but quickly jumped back to the NBA Development League's San Antonio affiliate Austin Toros..When U Totem split up in 1994, the 5uu's reformed and went on to make two more albums..He is also the subject of a 1974 biography by Marion Meloon..In 1953, he co-founded and became the first managing editor of The Paris Review, which won attention by publishing extended interviews with such authors as Ernest Hemingway, Thornton Wilder and William Faulkner..It is the second youngest of the established colleges, opening as an all girls college in 1972..Its natural habitat includes subtropical to tropical montane forests..In addition, he has privately released over 70 on limited edition CDs on his own Duns label.. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON1 was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, ""@CAPS9"". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is ""@PERSON2"". Apparently, @PERSON2's friends spotted @PERSON1 first and told @PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know @CAPS2 @MONTH1 hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects @CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter"" would we?"
" Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. The implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends. It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. I personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my father's side of the family. One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time. Laughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my father's entire family, and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it. Being that they are scattered across @LOCATION2, and very few live in the vicinity of @LOCATION1, visiting with these family members is a rare occasion. The most admirable quality of my father's side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well. Just @DATE1 my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in @DATE2. This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members.London Britain Township is a township in Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States..A legal conflict among AGB Nielsen Philippines, GMA Network and ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in the Philippines for an alleged television ratings breach that occurred in Western Visayas cities of Bacolod and Iloilo, has been ongoing since the last quarter of 2007-2008..Although theoretically made up of every sentient race in the galaxy, in actuality the League is controlled by (from Humanity's standpoint) hyperadvanced beings who have little concern for wants, needs, and desires of the less evolved races..ASEAN +3 adds China, Japan and South Korea..It was named a Texas Historical Landmark in 1980 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in July 5, 1984..French was co-owner, along with Russ Cline and Chris Fritz, as well as Executive Vice-President of the NLL's Philadelphia Wings..This steeply sloping hill has woodland, scrub and grassland..On 19 November 1779, HMS Hussar of 28 guns, under Captain Elliot Salter, was in company with HMS Chatham of 50 guns..Cork's All-Ireland victory was their first in six years..1978 in the Philippines details events of note that happened in the Philippines in the year 1978.. Not only was I to be the only guy there, but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year. Although we had always enjoyed eachother's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities. The day of my sister's baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat. Within ten minutes of doing so, my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. However nervous I had been, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower. For the duration of the party, all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts, or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically. on this specific day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt."
"  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes.Humboldt Beginnings is the fourth studio album by The Pharcyde, an alternative Hip Hop group..The village contains a cohesive collection of architectural resources reflecting a wide variety of vernacular types and popular expressions dating from the early 19th century through the early 20th century..Self-translation occurs in various writing situations..She also does voice-over work for adverts and television documentaries..It was released on March 29, 2008..In December 2015, he broke Herschel Walker's single-season college rushing yards record in the SEC..The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments..The two statutes under which income tax is calculated are the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; the former is gradually being re-written into the latter..In extreme cases, cadmium (present in some older silver solder alloys) can cause loss of consciousness..Gregory William Weadick (born February 7, 1954) is a Canadian politician and former Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the constituency of Lethbridge-West as a Progressive Conservative.. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless! "
" Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2 , and @CAPS3. On my birthday the whole @CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the @DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so.The Sempione is a rare breed of domestic goat from the mountains of Piemonte in north-western Italy and the neighboring area of Simplon in the canton of Valais in Switzerland; Sempione is the Italian name for Simplon..It is defined as type of GSM service that is characterized by tomato SIM card, tomato voucher and tomato user account..The album has sold in more than 50,000 copies in Balkan..Japanese manga tradition has included genres of girls' comics that feature homosexual relationships since the 1970s, in the form of yaoi and yuri..This facility was latterly owned by the privatized Scottish Power utility group..Obelistes trivittatus is a species of leaf beetle of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, observed by Burgeon in 1941..The commercial distribution of electric power started in 1882 when electricity was produced for electric lighting..The Dnepr made its maiden flight from Site 109 on 21 April 1999..Devonshire was then assigned to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and supported the Allied invasion of Madagascar in mid-1942..The 1984 Florida Citrus Bowl was a college football postseason bowl game that featured the Georgia Bulldogs and the Florida State Seminoles.. Then on the @DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS2. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS3! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad ""A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1""."
" Once upon a time on @DATE1, I had my birthday party and my friends come over. My friend tree brought his projector over and hooked his @CAPS1 to it. We played @CAPS2: @CAPS3 on his projector and on my @CAPS4.V. with my @CAPS1.Associated minerals include quartz, potassium feldspar, muscovite, schorl, riebeckite and magnesite..Optimal production management aims to minimize work in process..It is the biggest loch on the island and is popular for fishing..Class 1 regulations restricted engines to a maximum of six cylinders, 2.5 liters capacity and four valves per cylinder..Veil of Ignorance is the fifth studio album by Swedish hardcore punk band, Raised Fist..Ikebana is a Japanese or eastern style of floral design, and incorporates the three main line placements of heaven, man and earth..Yuhi Kabhi is a 1994 Bollywood film directed by Kumar Bhatia starring Anil Dhawan, Ashok Kumar, Parikshat Sahni, Bhagwan Dada, Archana Puran Singh, Manisha Koirala, Tinnu Anand and Kumar Bhatia..In the House, Democrats won major gains, but Republicans retained a solid majority..He was raised in Canada and the United States, and has since lived and worked in countries ranging from Italy to Iceland..Edison Park has one of the highest concentrations of Irish ancestry in Chicago, where they make up over three-fourths of the neighborhood's population..

Then we went to the park that was by our apartment. We played @CAPS6 and made jokes and laughed a lot more. Then we went back to my place and we watched @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @NUM1 and laughed at the people who screamed. Then we play spin the bottle/truth or dare and we laughed a lot."
" The only true story that I can remember that involves laughter was about @NUM1 years ago at the beach. I was with my mom and my sister @LOCATION1. I was running from incoming waves when I decided to run into just one wave which that wave sweep me off my feet and spun me around for what seemed like forever, but wasn't even @NUM2 seconds. I laughed so hard that I tripped and i started spinning again, my mom had to get me up because I could not stop.It gives its name to the Gloucestershire village..He also served as suffect consul in 102, replacing Lucius Licinius Sura as the colleague of the consul who opened the year, Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus; both Justus and Servianus closed their nundinium at the end of April..Out of Practice was an American sitcom that was produced by Paramount Network Television and originally broadcast on sister company CBS from September 19, 2005 to March 29, 2006..The original pipe music was composed by Malcolm Arnold, who also wrote the music for The Bridge on the River Kwai..He also studied under Rabbi Nochum Partzovitz at the Mir yeshiva in Jerusalem, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Feinstein of Bnei Brak, and Rabbi Shneur Kotler and Rabbi Dovid Schustal at Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood, NJ..It broadcasts at different hours on antv is the schedule of some sporting events that the channels broadcast interfere with the usual TV schedule..It is published quarterly by the Foreign Trade Publishing House of North Korea..It rejects the scientific consensus on global warming, and says that policies to fight it would be damaging to the economy..It is a melodrama about a drunken scoundrel who causes trouble..One of his entries includes that of the court appearance of ex-Oba Dosunmu, who had been subpoenaed..

"               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.The common indications for PTK are corneal dystrophies, scars, opacities, and bullous keratopathy..The only Member for Ivanhoe was John Scaddan of the Labor Party..The GE 45-ton switcher is a 4-axle diesel locomotive built by GE between 1940 and 1956..Some Japanese superstitions are meant to teach lessons or serve as practical advice..In most U.S. states, public law libraries are part of the trial court system, a department of the state or county government, or an independent local government agency managed by a board of trustees..The soundtrack was released on July 24, 2007 by Adrenaline Music Group and peaked at #108 on the Billboard 200 chart..It is a new CDP formed from part of the old La Victoria CDP prior to the 2010 census with a population of 271..The area is located within the former City of Gloucester, and is bounded on the north, west and south by the former Gloucester City limit, and on the east by the Aviation Parkway and Highway 417..The population was 160 at the 2000 census and 198 in 2010..Women's World Chess Championship was held from 16 March to 7 April 2015 in Sochi, Russia..  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought""@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.""I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,""@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there. "
"                The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the of day of @DATE1, I was turning @NUM1 years old and me and my best friend were at home, I called him seeing what he has planed for this nice sunny day and he told me he had nothing in mind, so we kept trying to think of something but for @NUM2 hours we had no luck. I called him again and we met up at a grade school and just sat down @CAPS3 a bench and started calling people to see whats up with everyone and no one would answer there phones. It became about @NUM3 pm when we stopped calling people to make planes, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat, I told him sure since we had no luck for a whole @DATE2 @TIME1. What sucks was that it was the @DATE2 of the @DATE3, and school was going to begin @CAPS3 @DATE4.Like many species of mid-water animals, it is deep red in color..The player starts out with a certain amount of pretend money that can be used to practice for the real casino..Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System is a book by Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort describing the history and technical challenges of programming for the Atari 2600 video game console..The dominant Swati language and culture are factors that unify Swazis as a nation since there is no other language spoken except for English..The song was re-released in 1977 and reached number one on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada in July 1977..German submarine U-76 was a Type VIIB U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II..Services include counseling for couples, families, young people and individuals, sex therapy, mediation and training courses..It has a single long, curved leaf and up to seven or more white to pale blue flowers, green on their back side..Reynolds developed a keen interest in the bulbs and succulents of South Africa at about this time..For a short time near the end of the Fisher Price run, a version targeted at younger children was released called Basix Construx.. So while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see whats up and whats happening.  We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty good, till we started hearing music bumping from a distance, so we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he told me he's going to go pick up lights for a @ORGANIZATION1 and I asked him who's all there and he told me that I need to see for my self. So we walked around the corner of the street we were @CAPS3 and saw the @ORGANIZATION1, we walked up to the door and saw are other friend who was standing at the door, we asked him where is everyone, we been bored all day with nothing to do @CAPS3 my own @CAPS1 and he told me that were here now and that's all that matters, so we walked in and saw everyone we called @DATE5 and more and they screamed @CAPS5 @CAPS1 to me and I was shocked why this @ORGANIZATION1 is for me and how did I get to my own @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 accident. I finally found out that it was planed for me the whole time, I guess that the flier by the restaraunt was put there @CAPS3 purpose and my friend was @CAPS3 this little @CAPS2 to get me to the @ORGANIZATION1 and it was all planed from the beginning of the day for people not to answer my calls or my friends but to get me to go buy some food and to find the flier and get me to go to my own @ORGANIZATION1 and I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get food to find my own @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 flier and we all had a good laugh, The @CAPS8!"
"                                       @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 wants to travel, and while traveling is fun, it is more exciting to go with people you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with people you @MONTH1 not know very well. Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 has an opportunity to go on a trip together. During these trips, the students are able to work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and just have a great time together. It's a experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of. At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION2. I was ecstatic to be going, but I'm an extremely introverted person and I knew that I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk, and was scared I would be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they would go across a street corner that didn't have a @CAPS5 dip down into the street, and thousands of other things that were racing through my mind. I was so terrified that that I would be separated from @PERSON3, my one friend who was in choir, that I almost didn't go. I'm not really sure how, but my mother convinced me that everything would be alright, and I had nothing to fear. Once we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split up into groups to see who wanted to go to explore the @PERSON7 and who wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true, I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I just kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I got on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @PERSON4, came to sit by me, and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we arrived at the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street we split yet again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to ride in one of the old trolleys up to the top then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep.Approximately 3,400 institutions participate in the program..It included Zig zag moderne architecture..The city has achieved great success in the field of physics, with the electron (J.

I was forced to go on the trolley because the hill was so steep part of the sidewalk contained steps, and since I can't walk, the only alternative was the trolly. Several of the other kids went with us and once again @PERSON4 was in my group. A couple hours later, after getting lost and turning on several wrong streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid conversing with @PERSON4 this whole time, so the ride up the hill was enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be riding on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 on our ride.  There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperons, @PERSON6, and @PERSON5 raced back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me, alone, with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, who was the remaining chaperon. We walked leasiurly down the hill, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every so often they would ask me a question and I would answer in as few words as possible, and that's what was going on when we walked past a group of men, arguing, in front of a store and one of them yelled, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?"" We didn't really know who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we just kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block @PERSON4 and I simultaneously broke into laughter. The man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses that I should have said to the man, each one being more hilarious than the last one, and as conversations go, we eventually got on different topics, which made me realize that @PERSON4 and I really did have many similar traits. We both loved musicals, we both enjoy reading, and we both have annoying, younger brothers. Ever since that day, @PERSON4 and I have been fairly good friends, all because we took a moment to laughed together."
"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE1, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE2 time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was sweet, @CAPS2 I though, until one @DATE2 day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" @CAPS2 me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back.Mercer enrolls approximately 8,300 students in its eleven colleges and schools..In the 1960s and early 1970s it served as a general admission venue for rock concerts, roller derbys and professional wrestling matches; it closed in 1971 and was demolished in 1982..Inaugurated in 1942, the Vineland Handicap was last run in 1999 when that year's American Champion Female Turf Horse, Soaring Softly won..In June 1990, Helix Software licensed technology from Headroom to Digital Communications Associates for use with their IRMA boards and IRMALan software..LDS apostle Bruce R.

I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS2 as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughing has helped me a lot in life because it brings me up when I am feeling down."
" It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON3!"" We heard @PERSON2 scream as @PERSON1 and I walked into my room. ""@CAPS1 boy."" I thought, ""@CAPS3 we @CAPS7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS3 at the same time."" @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS28 head.  ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 happened this time?"" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS7 at each other the way @CAPS29 were. ""@CAPS4!"" I finally yell. ""@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're going to do. You,"" I pointed to @PERSON3, ""@CAPS7 and sit over there."" @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, @CAPS29 nodded in response. ""@CAPS9, @CAPS14 lets @CAPS7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. ""@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 just a comical genius?"" @PERSON2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 said laughing. ""@CAPS14 who's calling who crazy?"" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON2 had on @CAPS28 game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON1 and whispered, ""@CAPS1 this is not going to be pretty."" We started preparing for the worst. ""@CAPS17 grab @PERSON3's arm and drag @CAPS28 if you have to, out of this room."" @PERSON1 jumped to @CAPS28 feet and got @PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 to my bed. When @CAPS29 had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS28 up but kept myself between @CAPS28 and the door. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 is going on with you two?"" I nervously asked @CAPS28.  @PERSON2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine.SpyLocked issues false security messages alleging that the user's computer is infected with malicious spyware..On May 30, 2016, WWHP changed their format to classic rock..The magazine is based in Nashville, Tennessee..The 1980 United States Senate election in Colorado was held on November 3, 1980..In 1962, the company adopted the name of one of its acquisitions, Chris-Craft Boats, which was founded in the late 19th century and became famous for mahogany-hulled powerboats in the 1920s through the 1950s..He was part of the Indonesia Junior team that won the bronze medal at the 2013 Asian Junior Championships..As a result of the 2009 administrative divisions reform of Latvia, Lauderi Parish was absorbed by Zilupe Municipality..George Trevelyan (17 December 1765 - 13 October 1827) was an Anglican priest in the late 18th and early 19th centuries..The Ranvet Stakes is an Australian Turf Club Group 1 Weight for Age Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-olds and older over a distance of 2,000 meters, held at Rosehill Gardens Racecourse in Sydney, Australia in March..Myxobolus cerebralis is a myxosporean parasite of salmonids (salmon, trout, and their allies) that causes whirling disease in farmed salmon and trout and also in wild fish populations.. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before."" @CAPS20 started flowing down @CAPS28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  ""I...I don't know @CAPS22 h..happened."" @PERSON3 said still weeping. ""I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha..happened today."" @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS22 happened that we missed.  ""@CAPS22 did you mean when you said @CAPS22 happened today?"" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS15 @CAPS28 response. ""@CAPS23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?"" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. ""@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3."" All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @PERSON3. ""@CAPS4, this is pointless. @CAPS23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS29 just make things more complicated anyway."" I looked to both of them, @CAPS20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. ""@CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget?"" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. ""I'm @CAPS23 sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?"" @CAPS28 face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 to reply. ""Of course I forgive you."" @CAPS29 hugged with @CAPS20 still streaming down their faces. All was well again."
"                Twins For a @CAPS1  Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially the laughs that make your stomach feel like its going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's @CAPS23 I surround myself with people that are like me, that's my best friend @PERSON1 and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together @CAPS24's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter. The best part of our friendship is that we are alike I think, and we use @CAPS24 to our advantage. One @CAPS1 @PERSON1 and I were taking a stroll downtown. We were just window shopping,when we past a clothing store that had on display a auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. @PERSON1 and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me.When I turned to @PERSON1 and said "" @PERSON2? (her nickname) @CAPS2 if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS14 meet @CAPS3 later?"". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS24 was @CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we deiced that showing a little neck wouldn't be to bad, @CAPS7 we just threw our hair up in buns and called @CAPS24 good. As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous ""@CAPS5, kinda"" @CAPS24 was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone.Vuzu is a South African youth-oriented television channel produced by M-Net for sister pay television platform DStv..This is the article on the family Hippopotamidae; for the main article on hippos, see Hippopotamus Hippopotamuses are stout, naked-skinned, and amphibious artiodactyl mammals, possessing three-chambered stomachs and walking on four toes on each foot..US Post Office-Boonville is a historic post office building located at Boonville in Oneida County, New York, United States..On pedigrees, the proband is noted with a square (male) or circle (female) shaded accordingly..It coordinates several existing shipboard systems..Voice activity detection (VAD), also known as speech activity detection or speech detection, is a technique used in speech processing in which the presence or absence of human speech is detected..It consists of an intro and 4 songs..The Maung Aboriginal people are the traditional owners of the Goulburn Islands..Aper Aku Stadium has a capacity of 20,000 people..The name comes from the German word for ""dead bodies"" alluding to the numerous graves on the island..  We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting @CAPS3. when we were close to the lawn of the library @PERSON1 turned to me and said ""hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!""@CAPS7 I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello, he asked where I was and she said ""I do not know actually""while she dug in her bag, ""but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put."" ""@CAPS8"" he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said ""@CAPS9 I am!"" he was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road, he jumped a little, and I said ""@CAPS10 did I scare you?"" in an little school girl voice, and he replied ""@CAPS5, of course not! A man does not get scared."" I just rolled my eyes and him and said ""I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes"". He was apprehensive at first but he did as I @NUM1 had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did. When they were face to face @PERSON1 shouted ""@CAPS9 @CAPS13 @CAPS14!"" and @CAPS3 nearly jumped to the moon. @PERSON1 and I were laughing @CAPS7 hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. @CAPS3 in confusion whipped his head between @PERSON1 and I, and said ""@CAPS16 this is interesting"" we continued laughing like buffoons, and @CAPS3 even giggled a little. He told us ""@CAPS18't you two ever do this again!"" and I said ""@CAPS19! We basically are sisters @CAPS7 @CAPS23 not play the part?"" he just glared at me in discontent and @PERSON1 rolled her eyes and said ""@CAPS2? Did the man get scared?"". We both cracked up again and @CAPS3 just smiled cause he knew we were playing around. @CAPS24 was just a blast after that, @PERSON1 and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got @CAPS3 to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When @CAPS24 was time to @CAPS14, we ventured to the parking lot where @PERSON1's mother was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we got in and asked ""@CAPS23 are you two wearing the same @NUM2 and I just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied ""@CAPS24's a long story"". @CAPS24 was the perfect end to an amazing @CAPS1 being my best friend."
"The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.  One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body. Two hours fly by and the girls got it.Docherty, who started his career with St Mirren, has also played for Stirling Albion, Brechin City, Alloa Athletic (twice), Stranraer and Dumbarton, as well as Montrose and Annan Athletic on loan..The music fuses together a plethora of dance styles in an intricate polyphony of rhythm..This is a list of butterflies of Djibouti..Wells was a loyalist and left for England in 1775 once war seemed inevitable, and the paper was continued by his son John Wells..They were held between 15 and 17 October 1964..It usually comes bundled with another program..His son Aidan made his debut for the Kerry senior team in their successful 2009 National Football League campaign..It rises in the broad saddle between the western end of Kerry Hill and the hill of Glog to its west and flows initially southwards to Llanbadarn Fynydd..The county was created on March 29, 1860, from parts of Clinton, Elk, McKean, and Potter Counties..The book has a preface by Lee Quarfoot, who was then fiction editor of Good Housekeeping Magazine.. They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.  The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other. All of this happened with me recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.  Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them I would not know what laughter is."
" Entering into the classroom, I began to shiver from anxiety. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school kept my head swimming with questions, which I put aside as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM1"" on the exterior wall. I swear, I could feel my bones literally shaking because of my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I came in. I noticed that they were all surrounding this @CAPS4-go-lucky brunette. No one really even took note that I was there until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at that brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my to-be peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, with my feet uncontrollably glued to the ground, looking blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got. I was unintentionally a fairly jealous child, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I got somewhat ignored, I stomach slowly twisted in knots more and more each day as I began to form feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl. Even her name sounded suspicious to me. @PERSON1. I had never in my life heard of anyone named @PERSON1 before. Luckily, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom as her. And even as a month passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday soon began to creep up after the first month at @LOCATION1. I was beginning to find out which people I wanted to be friends with, and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people I had gradually grown weary of, had to be invited to my birthday party because it was a class party and I didn't want anyone to be left out and since the class only had thirty people in it, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread around and people would begin to talk. I knew that I hadn't built up enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was actually like. As, I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I came across ""#@NUM2"". This was her number. The number of that girl with the bizarre name that I had an undeserved, grudge-like suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after I put that birthday party invitation into her cubby. When the day for the party finally rolled around, I had everything set up just how I imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake picked out for myself.A compound task is a complex task composed of a partially ordered set of further tasks, which can either be primitive or abstract..After police arrested a man that was wanted for armed robbery, black residents took to the streets in anger and looted and burned various stores throughout the West Side until the arrival of 1,200 National Guardsmen on July 15..The Cunningham Mountains are a small mountain range on the southeastern coast of Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada..From 1865 to 1923, the island was home to a farm run by Richard McCloud and Elisha Brigham..Watts was the printer for the University of Cambridge from 1802 until 1809, (a switch to stenotype was made by the school in 1804)..Friedrich August Krubsacius (21 March 1718 - 28 November 1789) was a German architect, teacher, and architectural theoretician..The Churchill White Paper of 3 June 1922, officially Correspondence with the Palestine Arab Delegation and the Zionist Organization was drafted at request of Sir Winston Churchill in response to the 1921 Jaffa Riots which began with intra-Jewish violence escalated into Arab attacks against Jews..He represented Egypt during the 1971 World Team Squash Championships..Best of Times News is a monthly news-magazine published in Shreveport, Louisiana..The following is an overview of the events of 1977 in motorsport including the major racing events, motorsport venues that were opened and closed during a year, championships and non-championship events that were established and disestablished in a year, births and deaths of racing drivers and other motorsport people.. The guests began to arrive knocking at the glass door, temporarily staining it little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON1 came alone. As I opened the door, she timidly and immediately shoved a gift at me and shyly muttered under her breath ""@CAPS4 birthday @CAPS5"". I welcomed her traditionally, as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party continued to go in several directions until my mom gathered everyone around, so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and she would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person who I had selfishly pretended to not exist, was the person who I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left because the party ended and I silently pouted for having to share my birthday with another person. After the party, I walked into the house, only to find @PERSON1 sitting on my steps. Her mom apparently couldn't pick her up for another hour. I came over to her and casually started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a huge glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled @CAPS4 birthday to me and threw it at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I continued to stand there with my mouth gaping. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. And without warning I started laughing too. And neither one of us could stop. It was at that moment when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we were unsuccessful, I had grown to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get close to. @PERSON1, through that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today."
" I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON1. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON1. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.Lincoln High School derived its name from the first public school located in Harrison County in the vicinity of the nearby community of Gypsy..Candy Celeste Broad (born 4 January 1956) is an Australian politician..Last made important collections of African Lepidoptera and Mollusca..There were 66 such governors or captains during the Spanish conquest and the later periods of Spanish-centered colonialism..Pathways World School, Aravali was the first IB Continuum School in North India and the first residential school in the region to follow the IB curriculum..Two days after war's end, Armstrong was killed in a flying accident while flying aerobatics in his Sopwith Camel..The most notable figaro chains are manufactured in Italy..In addition, Longley manufactures sandals in San Clemente, California and in China..His assassination during the political unrest of 2015, allegedly by supporters of the incumbent government of Pierre Nkurunziza, led to an increased polarization between government and its political opponents..The reconstruction of the church was paid for by brothers Richard and George Bradley and by subscriptions from the parishioners..  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto ""where it counts"" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter."
"                       My @CAPS1  @CAPS2 was a warm, @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to be seen. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours straight. That person was my @CAPS1.  My @CAPS1, @PERSON1, came over to hang out with the rest of the family and friends that were at my house. He was talking, laughing, and having a really good time. Of course, I was only about five or six years old at the time; but to me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world. That @TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all of the adults. All of a sudden, my @CAPS1 came up to me, gave me a big hug and started to talk to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke around and laugh, I was thrilled to have all the attention. I used to call them laugh attacks. Anytime my @CAPS1 talked to me, I started laughing and I would laugh so hard that I couldn't stop. That @TIME1, I had one of them. My @CAPS1 and I were joking around and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. @CAPS2 went on for about an hour straight. That was long after my @CAPS1 left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION2, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop laughing. She was laughing too, but not as much as me.  Finally, after a long hour or so, I got myself to calm down. The rest of the @TIME1 was great but every so often, I started to laugh again.Men's javelin throw events for wheelchair athletes were held at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in the Athens Olympic Stadium..U.

There was absolutely no way that I was going to stop giggling until I went to bed. After a long @TIME1 of having a good time, everyone left and went home. When my @CAPS1 came to say goodbye to me, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew that I would see him again. The next day, I was right about being able to stop laughing. I still smiled and hung out with my family, but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably.    My @CAPS1 was and still is a huge part of my life. He is always the person that can make me laugh and forget about all of my worries. Even though I don't live near him anymore, I can still talk to him on the phone and laugh and joke around with him. When I go visit him down in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 seems like we just pick things up where they left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other in a really long time.   When my dad passed away, my @CAPS1 was always there for me. He is the one male figure that I still have in my life. After everything that I've gone through, I could always count on him to brighten the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really do need a person like my @CAPS1 in their lives. @CAPS2 really does help to know that you have someone that loves you and can brighten your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @CAPS1 is very close, and the one thing that kept @CAPS2 that way is all of the laughs that we have shared through the years. Laughter is a huge part of anyone's life. I have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss, and sadness. However, after everything that I have come through, I can always come out laughing. When I was eleven years old, my dad passed away. At an even younger age, my parents got divorced. No matter how much those things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving on with my life."
"                             laughter @CAPS1 funny, normally when i fall of line, for some reason @CAPS1 humorous to me. I'm laughing in my head the hole way down down a rapid.I've taken plenty of beat downs whale I have been kayaking, @CAPS2 i think that my day running the upper stretch of the white salmon might have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call that day the @CAPS5 beat down. @CAPS4 was a very nice day and I felt like @CAPS4 would just be a normal day on the upper white salmon, @CAPS2 oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @PERSON3, @PERSON2 and I parked the car. @PERSON3 had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat. I had no doubt that we could conquer this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @CAPS4 took the strength of all three of us to get @CAPS4 on. After a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in. This is a fairly simple put in, you start off with finding a faltish spot on a @NUM1 foot rock slide. after you find your spot, you simply slide down the rock and of a seven foot drop into water. Unfortunately @CAPS4 wasn't that simple for me, I slid down the rock and of the drop perfectly fine @CAPS2 little did I know I didn't put my spray skirt on all the way so when I dropped into the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @CAPS4 because @CAPS4 was just a gallon. I actually thought @CAPS4 was kinda funny and that put a good feeling in my gut because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @CAPS4 would help my weight distribution a little bit.

We were about half way through our run when I was starting to realize the magnitude of how gnarly this river was, I was rolling in every rapid I possibly could and laughing my face of every time, @CAPS2 I couldn't quit, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @DATE1 foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was down stream! We were nearing the end of our trip and we had @CAPS2 only one more big drop still left to conquer. @CAPS5 falls, a @NUM2 foot drop (depends on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop isn't like any ordanry waterfall in fact this drop isn't really anything like a waterfall, sure you definitely will feel the free fall @CAPS2 the water hydrolics are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon gets narrow and when all that water goes over a ledg @CAPS4 creates a hole at the bottom. @CAPS4 is also legged out at the bottom so there's tons of water boiling back up stream, so ounce your stuck in that hole @CAPS1 like trying to paddle up hill and there's basically no way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath and stay calm. We were neering @CAPS5 falls and there's only @NUM3 eddies you can catch before the falls so you can scout @CAPS4. Funny enough when I was trying to make the second @PERSON1 my boat got bumped out by @PERSON3's boat and that little bump ended up flipping me upside down and spinning me backwards, at this point there wasn't much I could do about the next few minutes of my life. So I plunged over the falls, I was mixed up in a huge whitewater mess for about a minute and a half, only having brief moments where I could possibly catch a breath of air. I toughed through @CAPS4 and didn't pull my spray skirt because i didn't want to drink from the shoe(don't ask) and because of if I ended up ejecting from my boat there's no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I powered through @CAPS4, what was only a short minute seemed like a lifetime to me. I ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed. when I rolled up, I had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have made @CAPS4 if I didn't have a good attitude coming into this day and having the need to laugh in my head when I messed up. All in all laughing saved my life! "
"                            Closer @CAPS1 @CAPS2  In life, I think that laughter is a very important element. Without it, everything just wouldn't seem as fun. Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter.  It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE1. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished.  First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a ""natural high"" day.They are distinguished from the Endopterygota (or Holometabola) by the way in which their wings develop..5Linx is an American multi-level marketing company headquartered in Rochester, NY, which offers utility and telecommunication services, health insurance, nutritional supplements, and business services..Lifesblood is the second EP by American metal band Mastodon..No. 10 is a census division in Alberta, Canada..Azerbaijan had never qualified for the FIFA Futsal World Cup until 2016, but they have participated in the last five editions of the European Championship..The editors-in-chief are Frank L. Lewis (University of Texas at Arlington), John O'Gray, and Steve Thompson..Since launch, Karbach has experienced rapid growth thanks in part to the brewery's veteran roster..Tyler was born and raised in Catlin, Illinois to Cynthia Donnell and James Moore..Prior to its initial theatrical release, this excursion into the unique world of Deaf communities in France was featured in international film festivals..He describes these as transportable and easy to store physical assets with no income stream (and so no exposure to income tax) and no incumbent debt, whose performance appears unrelated to the performance of equity markets; and he notes that none of these factors would be affected by sovereign default.. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything.  With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS5 awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time.  Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... ""@CAPS4, how can two people ever be so much alike?!"" @CAPS5 that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS6 this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!"
"Laughter, an important part of life, just the feeling of laughing is comforting because at that time everything is okay.Laughing brings people together and makes them laugh together, its like a way of communication. Once you laugh about something other people start laughing and it connects everybody together to be happy. Its like telling everybody to be happy but without even talking to them.That's when people laugh with you, but when they laugh at you, well that's a different story.I remember one day when I was home washing the dishes and everyone in my family was frustrated, even me.It is affiliated with Khan Academy, a non-profit educational organization..The whole council of 21 members was up for election, with thirteen members elected in the St Mary's electoral division and another eight from the 'Off Islands': being two each from Bryher, St Martin's, St Agnes and Tresco..In Chemical Engineering terminology, Azeotrope is a mixture of two or more liquids whose proportions cannot be altered by simple distillation..2012 marked the Seminoles' 21st season as a member of the ACC and their eighth in the ACC's Atlantic Division..Ham Green Pottery was produced between 1100 AD to 1250 AD at a hamlet above the village of Pill called Ham Green in the English county of Somerset..In some languages the tense tends to be ""shifted back"", so that what was originally spoken in the present tense is reported using the past tense (since what was in the present at the time of the original sentence is in the past relative to the time of reporting)..This formation is little more than a shallow depression in the lunar surface, its features eroded and blanketed by the ejecta from the relatively fresh crater Antoniadi just to the north..Bodine debuted with Jay van Feggelen as the vocalist, who performed as the Barbarian in the album Into the Electric Castle by Ayreon..The name Adhil has been applied to a number of stars, especially in the constellation of Andromeda..He made his first-class cricket debut for Leeds/Bradford MCC Universities in March 2012 and has played in all forms of cricket for Kent..I hate being mad and I hate it when people get mad, so I said something, I don't remember what but then everyone started laughing,it put everyone in a good mood.I think of laughing like fire,one candle can light @NUM1 candles.When you hear people laugh, the first thing that comes to your mind is,""something must be funny"".And you want to go and see what it is so you can laugh too. that's very common for most people who like laughing. personally I love laughing because its a good weird feeling."
"I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and,how they feel about you,@CAPS1 that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you. @CAPS1 you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person.Laughter is from the heart and soul. @CAPS1 that person Tell's you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two. Feelings,@CAPS2, @CAPS3 is a lot between two people. @CAPS3 is from the soul and down deep with in your body. as my mom would say @CAPS3 helps clear the mind and body , but what i really think is that @CAPS1 some one makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. you laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh. @CAPS1 it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about @CAPS3 is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and,then @CAPS4 it is funny then you start @CAPS3 about it. Here is what my mom use to says to everyone is that ""@CAPS4 you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body"". There are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, i think @CAPS3 is just a feeling that people have. You @MONTH1 tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start @CAPS3 because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh. There are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell my self almost everyday that @CAPS4 I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul.Mustapha Adrar (born 12 April 1982) is an Algerian professional basketball player..Anthracoideaceae are a family of smut fungi in the order Ustilaginales..Plantation is a city in Broward County, Florida, United States..The Outback Archives, where people can come in and research local history or research their family..The 1989 Pepsi Canadian Junior Curling Championships were held at the Heather Curling Club in Winnipeg, Manitoba..Barangay elections are held in the country's 42,000 barangays for the positions of barangay captains and six councilors on May 9, 1994..Before devolution it served as the Belfast headquarters of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland Office Ministers and supporting officials..It measures the electrostatic field of an object in volts, measuring both the initial peak voltage and the rate at which it falls away..Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism is a 2007 book by Austrian school economist Robert P. Murphy..The series has grossed over $1 billion worldwide so far.. But is it really about me no it is not. @CAPS1 you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't. What you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean. I have been told funny things over the past few years but im a teenager what do you think i will remember them all. I am just like everyone else I will forget them over the years real easy. I not all that smart but after I think about it for a few min I finally under stand the joke. I know I am a @CAPS5 but I have those days where I am saying what to people what are you talking about, then they look at me and, they just say wow! you really are @CAPS5 and I also have @CAPS5 jokes about me and I really do not mind @CAPS1 people tell @CAPS5 jokes to me. Cause I am not affected at all I got use to it. @CAPS1 I heard my first @CAPS5 joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me. Then I walk up to them and I was like ""@CAPS6 I finally got that joke and, then I was like what a really good joke. @CAPS1 you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you. They might even tell you a very funny story about themselves, or someone that is related to them. @CAPS1 you laugh is like your showing your feelings and, @CAPS2 to that person, because @CAPS4 you do laugh then it is just like wow you are really lost on what they where trying to tell you. I will always tell my self @CAPS4 i need a laugh or something to either call my friends up or just look in the mirror every morning. because for some odd reason i think i am just really funny looking. most people think that @CAPS4 you look at your self and make funny faces in the mirror you will laugh non stop. the reason i laugh is because i see or hear something really funny o just wanna laugh so much. @CAPS4 i have a good day or a good weekend i laugh a lot"
"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white.The A part damages gut epithelium through inhibiting its protein synthesis, facilitating entry to the blood stream..The editor-in-chief is Charles Brainerd (Cornell University)..Patel belongs to a group of writers who have subscribed themselves to the 'Green Movement' which is involved in an effort to protect the environment..Damich was the first president of the National Federation of Croatian Americans..The blocks were originally patented by The Lego Group in 1961 as ""toy building bricks"", and the company has since remained dominant in this market..The theater teaches and hosts performances of improvisational comedy..KABAYAN's expelled nominee, Rep. Harry Roque, was appointed the Spokesperson of President Rodrigo Duterte rendering his cases in COMELEC for ouster moot and academic..Ematheudes paleatella is a species of snout moth in the genus Ematheudes..It is two hundred and sixty-five miles southwest of Kodiak..The assembly consists of 36 deputies, each of whom is elected for a term of 5 years.. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1! What is this??"" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story. "
" Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all i wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1, do before his final days. I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together.King began his career in the 1970s together with Fred Penner and Al Simmons in the band Kornstock..Sent to Bermuda, he had escaped in 1853 to the United States..It is the only two-year college in the nation that shares a campus and facilities with two four-year universities, Metropolitan State University of Denver and the University of Colorado Denver..The tree is native to East Africa and grows up to 5 meters (16 ft) tall..Clarence Eugene Sasser (born September 12, 1947) is a former United States Army soldier and a recipient of the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions in the Vietnam War..According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 19,158 people..Per Harrysson is a Swedish former footballer who played as a forward..He later adapted it into a screenplay for Everybody Wins (1990) starring Debra Winger and Nick Nolte..Gaujiena Parish (Latvian: Gaujienas pagasts) is an administrative unit of the Ape Municipality, Latvia..Sextonville is an unincorporated census-designated place located in the town of Buena Vista in Richland County, Wisconsin, United States.. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time i didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had saw him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away."
" Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried.To some this illustrates the low significance of any national cultural identity that remains shared among the two predominant language communities of the country..Avenue Theater, a professional theater located in the Downtown Denver vicinity..The tornado season in 2017 started exceptionally early, having the second most active January since records began in 1950, and one of the most active first quarters in recorded history..She has a special interest in nationalism in politics due to her family connections in Ireland..Roberto Lopes Nascimento or simply Roberto Lopes (born 16 August 1983 in Fortaleza), is a Brazilian defensive midfielder who currently plays for Serrano..Around the World is a 1943 American comedy film produced and directed by Allan Dwan, from an original screenplay by Ralph Spence..In 2011, the club was granted permission to enter the NEAFL, which is an even higher position within the AFL as a whole..This rimshot station transmits on frequency 106.9 FM and is owned and operated by LKCM Radio Group..Bisexual literature is a subgenre of LGBT Literature that includes literary works and authors that address the topic of bisexuality or biromanticism..Quercus myrtifolia (myrtle oak) is a North American species of oaks in the beech family.. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong."
" It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS7 best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS2 was. @CAPS2 had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS2 had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS2 could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS12 guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose."" @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 scoffed, ""your the kid they think can beat me."" ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS1 I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. ""@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!"" the coach called out, ""@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking."" ""@CAPS1."" I said, ""your name is what."" ""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS7 piece. Bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS7 turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS2 didn't even look like @CAPS2 cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.Originally the stadium was a home to the factory team FC Torpedo Zaporizhia that existed in 1982-2002..These ants can only feed on sap from trees or the juices of a deceased animal..His son was Paulo Henrique Filho..The long and short scales are two of several large-number naming systems for integer powers of ten that use the same words with different meanings..The game is divided into ten frames where a player gets a maximum of two innings to pocket ten balls..She is best known for co-hosting Today with Des and Mel with Des O'Connor and Let's Do Lunch with Gino D'Acampo..After joining Birmingham City Council as an economic development officer, she worked on some of the biggest urban regeneration projects in the country..The anime series was first announced to be exclusively released on the PlayStation Network on July 17, 2008 at the E3 video game trade show, and lasted twenty-six episodes..Patrick R. Hugg is an American legal scholar and professor..The 34-storey tower falls within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, though Middlesex Street forms the boundary with the City of London, the principal financial district of the world..  @CAPS8 picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS2 moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS1 I picked up @CAPS7 king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS7 in @CAPS13 game. I hit @CAPS7 clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS7 game.   @CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS2 was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS2 just did fools @CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS7 queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10."" in a loud voice.  @CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS2 said,""I do @CAPS13 with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS13 opening.""@CAPS2 started to laugh again, @CAPS13 time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two."" That surprised me I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really @CAPS2 had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again, the coach came over and saw that I won @CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @CAPS8 said, ""@CAPS13 is the start of a new beginning I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me."" @CAPS2 walked up to the coach and must have told him that @CAPS2 wanted me on board one for now I'm on board one and @CAPS7 new friend, @CAPS8 is there with me on board two.

"                   Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People A thing we have done since birth is laugh. Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves awkward situations, brings people together, and makes life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together. Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable.   I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I knew about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and just kept working hard. Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a little uncomfortable. After the last practice it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous cause what if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but everyone hated me on the team? He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called. When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me. I then told them how I didn't really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider. They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone, and I said no not really they didn't try talking to me so I thought why should I? My mom then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there. I thought about it and realized I really hadn't.Look at Yourself is the third studio album by British rock band Uriah Heep, released in September 1971 by Bronze Records in the UK and Mercury Records in the US..The E815 is known for having superb reception and has received a warm welcome from many phone enthusiasts disappointed with the shortcomings of the V710..Specification by example is used to capture examples of desired and undesired behavior and guide coding..It is the oldest continually serving school in Georgetown County..He wrote for Popular Electronics and Modern Electronics, and published Review of International Broadcasting..Produced, engineered, and mixed by Flood with Harvey as co-producer and engineer, it features the artist on vocals and guitar, John Parish on drums and percussion, Joe Gore on guitar, Sonia Slany on violin, Jocelyn Pook and Jules Singleton on viola, and Sian Bell on cello..The recipients of honors are displayed here as they were styled before their new honor, and arranged by honor, with classes and then divisions as appropriate..Things get complicated when Jake begins to sympathize with him; he learns that Baby-Snaps only wants to be a princess..Kristine first started when Nick Ashford invited her to perform with him and his wife Valerie better known as Motown legends Ashford and Simpson at their hip New York City venue Sugar Bar..It was the first space observatory to be operated in real time by astronomers who visited the groundstations in the United States and Europe.. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I also wasn't myself, because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around, I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time. I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there. The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named @PERSON1. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth. Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the practice went great. The awkward moments faded away into laughter. We all worked hard and joked around with each other, laughed, and I really felt like we were bonding. They laughter had brought us together. All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same. I believe that day that laughter brought our team together.  I will never forget that day. It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how well it brings people together. That season of volleyball I made many new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together, just because you known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter has to fade away, because I believe it should get stronger. Whenever I am meeting new people I always try to break the ice and lighten up the mood with something funny, because I think that a big point in our lives is to be happy, have fun, and all laugh togther. That is exactly what I plan to do."
"The mood was sweet and the room was worm with most of my family and friends. except for my brother and at the time i was only about @NUM1 or @NUM2? Hell i can't really remember so I'm just going to guess on the age. Whatever getting back to the story, so I'm looking all around our @NUM1 story house trying to find my brother but for some reason this time it just seems impossible. And all I can hear in the back ground is my family laughing as this little @NUM1 or @NUM2 year old is running full speed up and down hallways and opening and closing doors to rooms that hes never been in be for. And also shouting at the top of his lungs ""@CAPS1 where you be at i can't finded you"".Since October 2015, Lalao Ravalomanana has been Mayor of Antananarivo..Coalla is a town in the Coalla Department of Gnagna Province in eastern Burkina Faso..Tom Sawyer (born April 15, 1958) is a Democratic member of the Kansas House of Representatives, currently representing the 95th district..The statement came even as five people lost their lives due to damaged roads in the Mumbai region in the last two weeks..The Card Game, based on Wingnut Games' Battle Cattle miniatures game..Heimowitz started playing poker for baseball cards at the age of 9..Heligoland is a novel by British author Shena Mackay, first published in 2003 by Jonathan Cape..It is made up of seven regular ordnance battalions,three Base Depots and one volunteer (reserve) ordnance battalion and many independent ordnance depots give continuous support to the army..Originally intended to be a fourteen-story 76 room hotel, construction began in February 2012..Otuocha is a town east of the Niger river, and headquarters of the Anambra East local government area of Anambra State, Nigeria.. And with one more door to open that's at the beginning of the hallway where every one is sitting or standing. This little boy comes running down the hall in a panic who can't find his brother. And opens up the door and out pops @PERSON1 his brother who is wearing the scary monster mask and says ""I will get you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner"". So know what I did just as he told me to do. I ate my dinner so fast I ended up throwing up because a was so scared that he was going to come after me that night! And the funny thing is that this happened for the @DATE1 of my life so that the funny thing."
" Hi my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight.Anna Hunt is a journalist, author and shaman..Actinopeltis is an extinct genus of trilobite..Jimmy Melia (born 1 November 1937) is an English former footballer who spent most of his career playing for Liverpool and went on to become a manager..At the retirement ceremony, Wyatt received Air Force Distinguished Service Medal for his service..They put a variety of philosophical and empirical perspectives on subjectivity into play to obtain mutual enlightenment, and methodological and conceptual pluralism..The Valea Jelealului River is a headwater of the Lisa River in Romania..Colotis phisadia, the blue-spotted Arab, is a small butterfly of the family Pieridae, that is, the yellows and whites, which is found in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Arabia, the Near East and India..It peaked at a lowly number 90 on the UK Singles Chart..The school is affiliated to the State Boards WBBSE and WBCHSE and around 2900 pupils are educated in it..Stereum contains 27 species that have a widespread distribution.. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again."
" When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the "" big kid"" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION1 followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM1,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION1 parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION3. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2'.The player controls ""Rollo"" while attempting paint the entire maze and avoiding the ""Brush Brothers."".John responded by begging the aid of Charles the Fat, already King of Italy, and crowning him Emperor on 12 February 881..The film was released by Warner Bros. on March 16, 1929..The 45th ComFest was held June 23-25, 2017..On May 8, 1940, Ossowski was arrested in a house in the village of Komarniki, on the way to Hungary..Parsonsia diaphanophleba is a woody vine of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae..Many sectors are seeing this rapid increase in the amount of information available such as healthcare, supermarkets, and even governments with birth certificate informations and immunization records..Currently playing for F.C.

There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION1 i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION1 began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.  finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked ""how many?"". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION1 said ""row eight"". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION1 they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION1 stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION1 some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION1 the yelled "" blast off"" @ORGANIZATION1 the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION1 plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION1 turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION1 I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on I was addicted to roller coasters, @ORGANIZATION1 have ridden many since."
"  On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved that the most. @CAPS1 was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean its his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, thats awsome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and i went to is called @LOCATION1. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue ether. Yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I say him through the window. He turned his head and smilled, I could see all the glue still wet and it's everywhere.  My brother and me always had a good relationship, we both mad each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probable wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very importent part to any kind of relationship. It alows poth people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sence of humor you have.  As we approched the house, we saw @CAPS1 sitting on the porch waitting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS1 had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people dont come over. @CAPS1 said the whole family was coming over. My brother and i were so happy, we both new grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy.It is found in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe..The elections were noteworthy for their rowdiness and elements of political opposition..He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held on October 2, 1984, following the resignation of Bud Sherman in Fort Garry..The position of the Virgin and St. Bernard's prie-dieu are both slightly off balance, but not enough to ruin the serene harmony of the picture..A Man's Man is a lost 1929 silent film produced and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and directed by James Cruze..Cole and Shade Degges are brothers from Lake Jackson, Texas, David and Jimmy Wallace (who are also brothers) are from Shreveport, Louisiana, and Hayes is a Florida native..Dasypeltis scabra, known as the common egg eater, egg-eating snake or rhombic egg eater, is a species of nonvenomous snake endemic to Africa..Prior to 1916 they were known as the Private Secretary to the Governor..Each team had to play against all the teams which are competing for the title..This article is a list of War of the Worlds episodes.. Grandma showed up alittle after dad did. @CAPS1 was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brothers face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays. When my brother was at the table @CAPS1 brang in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier.  When the birthday cake was over and the presients, my brother and i went out to the back yard to play kickball. My brother wouldnt use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play, we both were having fun. We laught every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back and as the ball came close i kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast, insted of the ball going to his feet it went to his head. When the ball conected to his head he did a back flip off the ground. @CAPS1 and grandma were in aw, i was frozen still. When he got up he looked straight at me and laught. @CAPS1 started to laugh so did grandma, i was still frozen. I finaily went with it and by the time I started i couldnt stop. it was so funny, he got pickup off the ground and hit in the head with a ball and still laughs.   When it was time for everyone to go, @CAPS1 said her good byes and then it was grandmas turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forhead than me. As grandma was leaving my brother and i sat on moms lap and gave her a big hug and said ""I love you @CAPS1"". @CAPS1 was tcking us in bed and was about to leave when my brother said "" @CAPS1 my head hurts"". I love my family and even today we look back on this and laugh. This has been a joy to write i hope you think so to.  Short story by   @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1"
"One day I woke @CAPS6 staring out my window and was listening to the birds chirp out my window I usually leave my window open to sleep with fresh air because I hate breathing in my own breath its to warm anyways as I woke @CAPS6 I walked out and ate some rice crispy s with my to sisters @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. As I was about to finish I had realized I was late for school I was only I @NUM1 grade so I ran got dressed and told my sisters to @CAPS5 and get ready but you no how girls can be putting @CAPS4 there make-@CAPS6 and doing there hair.      My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @CAPS4 our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by ""@CAPS1 foul"" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in @NUM1 grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick @CAPS4 me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun part were all the laughter is so school is over right and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home, after @NUM5 min looking for i find her walking to the cross walk I yell her name ""@CAPS2"". She looks and I'm running to her and her friends as you no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street.   My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a @CAPS5 to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross guard lady to @CAPS3 to me.There is an information desk staffed by NPS Rangers, a book / souvenir store and bathrooms..The Dogs (also known as The Old House) in Wincanton, Somerset, England was built around 1650 and has been designated as a Grade I listed building..Microphysogobio longidorsalis is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to South Korea..Between 2008 and 2011, he served as Chairman of the Slovenian National Assembly..Brewton City School District is a school district in Escambia County, Alabama, United States..There are over 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia including Javanese, Sundanese, and Batak..He made his MLB debut with the Boston Red Sox in 2014..Cuckoo is described as a ""thriller about sounds and lies""..The release didn't occur however as Hunter left the label but the album did become available as an import when Hunter's next album became a minor hit..BootVis has been replaced with XbootMgr, and as such it is no longer available from the company's website.. At last she finally had noticed me, I was @CAPS4 walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6""so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying @CAPS4 the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me @CAPS6 he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear @CAPS4 and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear @CAPS4 and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and @CAPS4 top of that I couldn't feel the pain. Bu t the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and i was limping and what she told me got me mad she had told me to ""stop faking it"". I had told my mom that and she got so mad man you would not want to be that teacher so lets say it wasn't pretty. You're probably wondering what happened to the lady who hit me she pays for my docter bills. "
"So my friends and i got into a heated discusion on how we need to keep things to our selves cause one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us allot of problems in school and around town, @CAPS1 he started to lie to us one of my other friends lost it and went after him and tackled him down told him to quite lying. By the time he let him up and we all got back in are seats he started to spill his guts to us, he told us some rumers he started about us and some other things he did we kinda all lost it. So we calmed down a little then took turns talking to him, after my two friends talked it was my turn i was talking to him and he kept interupting me, finally i got mad and i grabed something off the floor to throw at him. Don't git me wrong not to hurt im to stop him from interupting me. I reached down grabed something soft without looking picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started to point and laugh, I stoped turned my head to look at what was in my hand.Firefighters later said that they did not have current training and certifications to perform land-based water rescue, and that funding for the program was cut..The firm was established in 1997..The temporary STAM collections describe the phenomenon of ""urbanity"" by means of contemporary issues..The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 2013..Cysts are not sexually transmitted..She was elected to state legislative assembly from Amritsar in 2007..Kwongan has replaced other terms applied by European botanists such as sand-heide (Diels 1906) or sand heath (Gardner 1942), giving priority to the language of people who have lived continuously in the southwest for more than 50,000 years..It is a cover of the Neil Young album of the same name, plus additional Neil Young songs Mr. Soul and Barstool Blues..Tamaqua is disused railway station located in the Tamaqua Historic District, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States..Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.. now remember it was an intense conversation you could cut the tension with a nife, for him to start laughing and everyone join in i didnt want to know. But i turned my head looked and fell over laughing it was a stuffed fairy i picked up off his floor i did through it at him, but playfully. We all finally stoped laughing and sat back down. I believe that it calmed us down enough to help exsplain and make things better for him and all of us. the moral of the story is even though your mad something will always make you smile and make your day better ."
" Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2.....  It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION2, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS1 points out there's no more sugar. She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no lables on them. ""I think its the the jar on the left"", she said. I grab the jar on the left side without another word.  Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS1 and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Imidiately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in there mouths'. Suddenly my @LOCATION1 makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty..Karl Markovics (born 29 August 1963) is an Austrian actor and film director..He has written or edited several books, including Nanoethics: Big Ethical Issues with Small Technology (2009)..Grant is an unincorporated community in Inyo County, California..Judge Columbia Lancaster House is a large house on the National Register of Historic Places in Ridgefield, Washington in the Southern Colonial style..Heart performed the song ""The Perfect Goodbye"" with country star Wynonna Judd on CMT's Crossroads in the summer of 2004.This album continued the move back to Heart's hard rock and folk rock roots, and although only peaking at number 94 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Since then the Sovereign Artists record company closed and stopped doing business..It stars Emma Roberts as Nancy Drew, with Josh Flitter and Max Thieriot..Fawcett made his debut for the Scarlets regional team in 2016 having previously played for the Scarlets academy..Boetsch vs. Henderson (also known as UFC Fight Night 68) was a mixed martial arts event held on June 6, 2015, at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, Louisiana..The Nantlle Railway (sometimes referred to as the Nantlle Tramway) was a Welsh narrow gage railway..The East Carolina Railway was a short-line railroad that ran from 1898 to 1965..... not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers. She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of no where everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happend with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter is real. First, I was with my @CAPS1. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION1's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakeably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop imidiately and take the time to have a laugh.  "
" Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in.Elulu is listed as the third king of the first dynasty of Ur on the Sumerian king list, which states he reigned for 25 years..Madinari Island is a remote island in the central Okavango Delta, Botswana..The complex includes the 1832-38 farmhouse, a bank barn, blacksmith shop, washhouse, smokehouse, chicken houses, sheds, and a privy..It is presented by Matt Allwright and voiced over by Jeni Barnett, each episode features four chefs..Formerly Brooklyn's 18th Ward, the neighborhood is now part of Brooklyn Community Board 4..They are often used as promotional materials for animated motion pictures..ALFA International College (formally known as Kolej Alif) is a private, international college located in Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia..It became known as the Panzer Division Holstein after mergers with other Panzer divisions on 10 February 1945 and was then again renamed back to the 233rd Panzer Division as new Divisional headquarters were hastily set up in April 1945..They are the sole living representatives of the order Phaethontiformes..When he left the city he cursed the inhabitants.. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared."

There are a lot of times where laughter was the biggest part of our friendship. But @CAPS3 not sure if we just think were funny or if people think were funny. My two best @CAPS2 are @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2. I've actually know both of them since we were little. It was about second grade when we became @CAPS2. Although we were never really close until about sixth grade. Now days @CAPS3 closer @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, then I am to @LOCATION1. I remember when @LOCATION2 and I would throw little pieces of eraser at each other across the room nearly missing our teacher. The first memory I remember @CAPS1 @PERSON2 was maybe when we were in third grade. We would goof off and mess around in @LOCATION3. The three of us haven't hangout a lot since high school started. It also doesn't help when we each go to different schools. But when @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and I do hangout were always laughing and having a good time. One example of laughter bringing us together, is when we went to @PERSON1 skate park for my birthday a few years back. @PERSON2's grandma was taking us there and along the way we asked if we could stop and get @ORGANIZATION1. I just got an @CAPS4 camera for my birthday so I decided to bring that along. We went the the @ORGANIZATION1's located on @NUM1 street. As we were going through the drive-thru and @PERSON2's grandma was ordering. @PERSON2 decided to roll his window down and started ordering stuff for himself at the same time his grandma was. He asked for a @ORGANIZATION2 and a large fry. What made this really funny was that his grandma was getting mad. She told @PERSON2 to stop and told the person over the mic not to listen to the male voice in the background. But @PERSON2 kept doing it anyways.The town is located adjacent to Kingston, and is approximately fourteen kilometers south of Hobart..The embryology and biology of shellfish, especially lobster, became his consuming interest..His feast day is May 11..The East Carolinian dates back to 1925..MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are the largest class of phosphatases involved in down-regulating Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling..Costochondritis is notable for feeling like a heart attack..All major aspects of the Java client, games and website are also available in English..On June 5, the Sparks and Farmers Insurance Group of Companies announced a multi-year marketing partnership that includes a branded jersey sponsorship..Cox model engines are used to power small model airplanes, model cars and model boats..The single was also later released in the United States on 6 April 2004.. When we were pulling up to the window to get the food @PERSON2 told his grandma to pull up far enough so he could get the food. So as we were pulling up @PERSON2 rolled his window up down and got the food. @CAPS3 so glad I brought my camera and recorded the whole thing. When we got there we hopped out of the car and went to the park. It was later in the day when we got there, probably about three or four. At first none of us really skated cause we were looking around. But when we did start skating we stayed there for about four or five hours. Cause when we left it was dark outside. There are four stair sets there, the two stair, the three stretch, the three block and the five stair. That's the order they go in from size and how hard it is to @PERSON3 them. Cause we were there for so long we had a lot of videos recorded. Some where of us skating, some where really random and funny, then others I don't know what the heck was going on in them. Later that day when we were tired and bored of being there @PERSON2's grandma came and picked us up. They both came over to my house when we got back. We just watched @CAPS5 and played video games. Its always funny to watch one of us get frustrated because were not winning. Eventually we stopped and listened to music. Around @NUM2 p.m @PERSON2 went home and @LOCATION2 stayed the @TIME1. As we were in my living room he was messing around @CAPS1 the tri-pod I had got @CAPS1 my camera. As he has it in his hands, he's unscrewing it and it falls apart. We both laught at first but then I got mad cause I just got that. This day was really fun, it was full of laughing, dedication to skating, and our friendship. It was a day that I felt closer to @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2.  "
" Laughing at @CAPS1 bell. @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together. We are always laughing about something even if @CAPS7's something completely stupid or actually really funny. We laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things. Also we laugh at funny things we do. @CAPS8 one thing that has always stuck to @CAPS11 head, the time at @CAPS1 bell. One day after school, me and @CAPS11 best friend @PERSON1 decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @CAPS1 bell. We ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @CAPS7. A few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @CAPS7. ""@CAPS4"" I said to @LOCATION1 as i took a bite of @CAPS11 @CAPS5 five layer burrito. ""@CAPS6""@CAPS7 was really hot and burned @CAPS11 mouth. I had to wait for a few minuets to eat @CAPS11 burrito. So we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives. A couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. Meanwhile I thought @CAPS11 burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head. Next thing i knew @CAPS11 burrito was coming out of @CAPS11 mouth and I was dieing of laughter.Red Warrior is an unincorporated community and coal town in Kanawha County, West Virginia..Previously, she served three terms in the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 108th district from 2010 to 2016..Opisthodontia is a clade of extinct sphenodontian rhynchocephalians..Disonycha conjugata is a species of flea beetle in the family Chrysomelidae..The body of lintneriana is black with a red, orange or yellow band across the pronotum and a short red stripe along the midline..The chosen winner will represent the Dominican Republic at the Miss World 2004..The General Election will take place on November 6, 2018..In 2010, Moore regained a consistent place in the Swans' forward line..He works as a freelance journalist, appearing in print, broadcast, and on the Internet..In 1976, the ground held its first List-A match when Northamptonshire played Lancashire in the John Player League..  @CAPS11 burrito was spit completely out of @CAPS11 mouth, and all over me an @LOCATION1. All over @CAPS11 hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table. I was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @CAPS8 to laugh. I think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @CAPS8 wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think this was the end of @CAPS11 bad day, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 only gets worse. Eating @CAPS11 burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever. @CAPS7 probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. Meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10. As i was returning to @CAPS11 table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line. I almost spilled @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS8 luckily I didn't. Returning to @CAPS11 seat i was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad @CAPS11 day was, and how @CAPS7 couldn't get any worse. Then i took a drink an I started to choke on @CAPS11 @CAPS10, @CAPS7 was so bad that i spit everything out onto @LOCATION1, @CAPS10 went flying everywhere, @CAPS7 even came out of @CAPS11 noes. So i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @CAPS11 self up, caught @CAPS11 breath, and told @PERSON1 i was ready to go home. When i look back and think about the day at @CAPS1 bell with @CAPS11 best friend, I not only think about how embarrassing @CAPS7 was for me and her, @CAPS8 also that @CAPS7 was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @CAPS11 life. As i said before @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday."
" Boy says too @CAPS2:@CAPS1 weigh?, @CAPS2: what? Boy:@CAPS3 i just wanted too say something to break the ice!Laughter is the greatest thing too have in any kind of relationship, such as family, friends, and a romantic type relationship. It bring each other great bondage and makes the relationship playful.It was @DATE1 and i was on my way too pick up a long time no see friend too go to a warped tour concert. We haven't been in the greatest terms because of an issue that was upon us a few months ago. I figure to take my friend @CAPS4 to a concert shes been wanting to go too all year long. When we finally picked her up there was all sorts of tension of unleft said words to each other, but i wasn't gonna wait any longer too see what was about too happen.Before we headed too the concert my parents decided too get a car wash, @CAPS5 then i automatically thought of a few funny things i could do to make her laugh. The car moved as slow as a turtle into the car wash machine. I had left the window crack open to were enough water would crawl in. We were kinda talking about the concert and i had looked very unaware that my window was open, i actually had too no idea that a lot more of water then i expect had came in.In 1998, she contributed renditions to tribute albums for Pete Seeger and Phil Ochs..The more advanced classes can lead to semicha..In May 2016 the school suffered a serious fire with damage estimated to run into the hundreds of thousands of Rands..Joseph ""Joe"" Spinks (born June 20, 1972) is an American retired basketball player and coach..Allolee to Walltown is the name given to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Northumberland, England..In fact, quite contrary to the zero page's original preferential use, some modern operating systems such as FreeBSD, Linux and Microsoft Windows actually make the zero page inaccessible to trap uses of NULL pointers..The series has been called ""historical fantasy, set in a time much like our 18th century""..For sixteen years, from November 1991 until October 2007, the C of I was known as Albertson College of Idaho..Its cost in July 2015 was around Rs..From Bremen he went to the University of Leiden, where he studies medicine under Carolus Drelincourt, Lucas Schacht and Theodorus Cranen..

She was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was i. From that moment on it was such an ice breaker for all the tension that was happening. the elephant had left or side and we had a great rest of the day. See, it true""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". When laughter is happening no one is truly sad, mad or anything else. Laughter can bring too people who just meet good greetings, too couples closer together, friend and family joy and happiness. Laughter is truly the key to happiness. "
" I think that laughter is a key element to any lasting relationship, because if you didnt have laughter then that would be one boring relationship. Let me share with you a personal story of my own.  I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is @CAPS1. We first met here at school and then he transfered and moved away, then a few months ago he added me on facebook and we started talking again. At the time we had started talking he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again he realized that she was not the one for him anymore. It was rough for him to break up with her but he did it and i am proud of him, becuase she treated him very bad.  In the beggining of our relationship we were both really shy and didnt talk much but the more and more that we hang out the more we start talking. We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts.Jaime Espejel Lazcano (born 9 June 1959) is a Mexican politician affiliated with the Party of the Democratic Revolution..Panama is an unincorporated community in Vernon County, in the U.S. state of Missouri..It is found in the Indo-Pacific: the Red Sea, East Africa to the Hawaiian, Marquesan and Tuamotu islands, north to southern Japan and south to Australia..Evelyn Wells (1899-1984) was a 20th-century American biographer and author most known for her biographies of the ancient Egyptian royals of the 18th dynasty, Nefertiti and Hatshepsut..Its natural habitats are moist savanna, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, rivers, and intermittent rivers..The government computer then produces antiviruses, the Computer Warriors, led by Romm to battle the Virus troops..Like many California potteries of that period, their original product lines focused on commercial tile and pipe, sanitary and gardenware products, and by the 1920s, Garden City was the largest pottery in Northern California..Chloroclystis olivata is a moth in the family Geometridae..Parwiz border point is the name of the main border trade center in the west of Iran..Pippens' led Penn State McKeesport to a championship title in 2006.. Everytime i see him i get really nervous and it almost seeems as if my heart skips a beat. Whenever we are walking down a street i cannot help but to smile. And when we lay on the cowtch and watch movies i can't help but to laugh when he tickles me. We laugh at each other all the time, wether its when one of us makes a mistake or what not. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong. Everytime he leaves i cannot wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it i feel like it would be a really boing and if it is boring than you wouldn't want to spend time with one another. I personally think that every moment with your significant other should be fully taken advantage of."
" They say laughter is the best kind of medicine their is. So to tell you the truth on that qoate I will tell you a true story on laughter and how its a medicine. I already have recognized in believing it my self. I also will explain its key element in part of the world. So to start us off I will tell you a story that has laughter in which fixed a few ed between my grandpa @CAPS1 and my cousin @PERSON1. To start off it had happened about some time during the @DATE1. We were all having a blast.

So @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I were minding are business playing games while our grandpa was watching us play and then out of no were we here a loud smack and then crying and screaming. So it had turned out that @PERSON1 ""slipped"" and smacked @PERSON3 who is only seven years old.Then our grandpa starts yelling and trying to figure out what the heck went down. After seeing @PERSON3's back with a big red hand mark on it that's when grandpa really let loose and just started going ballistic all over @PERSON1 but then @PERSON1 went home all piste. So later on @PERSON1 came back and then grandpa and I sat at the table talking to him. That's when I mentioned something that started to make every one laugh so hard that they all forgot what happened then he said sorry to @PERSON3 and we were all happy by the time grandma got home from work.So to conclude my story I wish to remind you on why laughter is an element or if it plays a part in something which was a true story in part of my life. So thanks for listening and when you or someone is down in the dumps or just really mad, laughter is the medicine for the job."
"Most people think that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and show who you really are. I believe all of that is true, laughter is one of the most important things a person can do. In my life laughter has helped me threw the hardest situations and made them a lot better. You can laugh a lot with friends, family, or people you barely even know. Laughing can mend relationships and help you get threw anything, in my life i have found that out many times.My mother and myself haven't always had the best relationship, we don't always get along, and since i have a severe separation anxiety from her we spend a lot of time together which can cause friction from being together too much. There was a certain time when we had just gotten into a fight about me wanting to go somewhere and her not letting me, i was expecting her to be mad at me for awhile for how rude i was being. We didn't talk for a couple hours and tried to stay away from each other, we would only talk to each other if it was really important. After a couple days of this going on i went into her room to talk to her about it all, when we talked i understood why she was so mad at me and i apologized and left her room, but i could still feel that there was some tension between us.The phosphorylation of this protein affects microtubule properties and cell cycle progression..With former partner Jeremy Barrett, Denney is the 2010 U.S. national champion..Stacey Chanelle Claire Solomon (born 4 October 1989) is an English singer, TV presenter and personality..Following the 1991 outdoor season, the team became the Gwinnett County Steamers..The institute is recognized by the Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority, Punjab..Walker was thus the first U.S. governor to continue in office after facing a recall election..In it she outlines her theory of neurosis..The spokesperson of the front, Khaled Saeed, was a member of the Virtue Party..In 1971, the College of Southern Nevada was founded to serve the growing population of Nevada..Brighton Heights has many large, older homes.. I wanted to make things better more then i have ever wanted anything, i wasn't really sure if she was ready to get over this fight, so i thought it would be better to give her some space and let her come to me when she was ready to talk. We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about. The next day we went to go do somethings around town, some grocery shopping and to see some family. In the beginning we didn't really talk much or anything. Within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together we were joking around and laughing at everything each other said. After our errands we went out to lunch, it was the funnest time i had ever had with my mom, we talked about everything and laughed and had an amazing time. The days after that were wonderful also, we spent a lot of time together and felt like we didn't want to leave each other, i know that laughing together and talking really helped with that, we opened up to each other like we never had before. I love my mother and care for her more then anyone in the world, when we got into that fight i was scared out relationship would never be the same again, we were able to work it out by laughing. I honestly think that laughter can cure anything, from a broken heart to a broken family."
"                   @DATE2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was a warm day, and @CAPS3 and I were on our way to my family reunion, in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2. Our car was crammed, and with my mom, grandma, cousin, and us two girls, @CAPS2 got really hot. @CAPS2 was about the @NUM1 of @DATE1, in @DATE3. I swear I thought we were all going to die in that car! We had the air conditioning on, but @CAPS2 didn't help much, I was in the middle of my cousin, @CAPS4, and @CAPS3. We finally got to a rest stop, and we all kinda stumbled out of the car. @CAPS3 wanted to go get a drink, so I followed. I'm pretty sure we were getting weird looks from all the people around us at this point. I was in my @LOCATION1 @CAPS6's, and @CAPS3 was in @CAPS8 @CAPS9. @CAPS2 felt like @CAPS2 had taken @NUM2 minutes to just walk to the drinking fountain. @CAPS2 was really that hot. I opened a cliff bar, while @CAPS3 was getting a drink.The shape of the molecule is a square pyramid..Previously, it also included the Great Basin Adventure, a children's park..The Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council elections were held on Thursday, 5 May 1988, with one third of the council to be elected..He earned an All-EuroLeague Second Team selection in 2005, while leading the competition in rebounds, with an average of 10.6 per game..In 2013 she wrote one more song ""Shubhaaramabh"" for Amit Trivedi in Kai Po Che..An ethical code generally implies documents at three levels: codes of business ethics, codes of conduct for employees, and codes of professional practice..He published a laudatory biography of Fontanesi..There have been various types of brakes used throughout history, and several are still in use today..The station and all trains serving it are operated by London Midland..Their sophomore studio album, Headspace, was released in May 2016..

The mouth thing on the fountain had been turned towards you when you drink, so @CAPS3 was drenched. I sarcastically said, ""@CAPS12, you won't be hot for a while now will ya?"" We both laughed, and she chased me, trying to get me soaked. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh together. Later that day, when we finally reached the family reunion, they had a pool. She tried to push me in, but I took her with me. Everyone was laughing at that point. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, than I did last @DATE2. Those were good times."

I would not be me if I didn't have laughter in my life . All relationships should have laughter involved in some way ,what would a relationship be without laughter!

Laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally . Through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships . But let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad.   I have always been very close to my dad , you might even say I am a daddy's little girl .Laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad. It somehow always found its way into our relationship. The @CAPS1 times of laughter are what I valued and treasured so much that whenever I think about it I cant help but smile . I remember when I was little if I ever needed a @CAPS1 laugh my dad was the person to call . The laughter grew stronger through out the years , I cannot recall a time where my dad and I had a moment where laughter was not involved . We always used to watch these @CAPS3 shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard .We would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family ,sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing it would just happen . I can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and I oh how I miss those @CAPS1 @NUM1 nights were what I looked forward to, I knew that I would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces . I looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing ,oh what @CAPS1 times those were . Since my dad moved to @LOCATION1 ,we haven't had those beautiful times of laughter that I miss so much, but I can always treasure them in my heart.It offers agricultural loans, in addition to other retail, advisory, treasury and investment services, including foreign currency and money transfer services..Jan A.G.M. van Dijk is a professor of sociology and communication science at the University of Twente, The Netherlands..Not to be confused with the computer-input device called a trackball..He was dropped from UMNO's list of candidates for the 2013 election, to be replaced by the state assemblyman for Kuah, Nawawi Ahmad..Inaugurated in 1940, there was no race in 1942 and 1943..There are 2,559 inhabitants in which 99% declare themselves Croats..Elaphria cyanympha is a species of cutworm or dart moth in the family Noctuidae..He competed in the fourth race of the 2009 season in a one-off for Genoa Racing and has been attempting to find a ride in the IndyCar Series..The Darley Arabian (foaled c. 1700) was one of three dominant foundation sires of modern Thoroughbred horse racing bloodstock, whose arrival in England during the reign of Queen Anne was the event which ""forms the great epoch from which the history of the Turf should be dated""..It broadcasts a Top 40 (CHR) station to Birmingham and north-central Alabama.. Those moments of laughter were the best moments I have ever had with my dad,since I was little girl till now almost an adult . I don't know if my dad and I would be as close today if we hadn't had all that laughter throughout our lives. Whenever I am sad or miss my dad , I go back to those times we had filled with laughter, and listen to his laugh playing in my head. I never knew how important laughter would be to me. I am glad laughter played such an important part in my life. Laughter is such an important part of life/relationships because it brings joy and happiness. Laughter is the type of thing that no matter what , should always be a part of any relationship. I think laughter is healthy for our bodies, for example if you're sad ,depressed ,or just not having a @CAPS1 day a @CAPS1 laugh will change that and make you feel a lot better ,like it did for my dad and I. Laughter also makes relationships last longer , the reason why I am so close to my dad , best friend, mom, boy friend , sisters etc is because of laughter itself . If laughter was not involved in my relationships , I could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life. My dad is the reason why I laugh so much , he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple. I never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is.  Where I would be today without laughter I truly have no idea. My dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. If laughter was not involved in any relationship , the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles,can you imagine having no laughter at all! I certainly cant imagine life without laughter. If my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact , we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today. What do you think about laughter? Has laughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships?  "
" I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a class room, or even form a book. I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room. One @MONTH1 be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon.  In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background. I was in my third period class; which was leadership at the time. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice @MONTH1 give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the class room in order to do what needed to be done that day. Leadership directly preceded myleast favorite class of the day, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I simply detested that class. I had been in @CAPS1 classes ever since I was in kindergarten at @ORGANIZATION1. I was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years. It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't. I just had a strong contempt for @CAPS1 class. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and I tended to talk a lot. She was that type of person who had @CAPS10 posture and was a stickler for the rules. The the type of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon.  In leadership that specific class period, the teacher was taking a particularly long time explaining what we were supposed to do that day. He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long winded. He could take the entire @NUM1 minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do. That day however, we weren't doing an assignment. At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment.Near the southern tip of the western part of the island is a small, unofficial nude beach..He died on September 9, 1964 in Onawa, Iowa..Milo is an unincorporated community in Bureau County, Illinois, United States, located east-northeast of Bradford..Provision for the carriage of a torpedo was semi-recessed into the underside of the fuselage, blended in behind an aerodynamic fairing..It is located in the ACCET campus in Karaikudi..Cymindis sulcipennis is a species of ground beetle in the subfamily Harpalinae..Supporters of the directive, largely media groups, publishers, and content creators, reject these arguments and claim that a disinformation and astroturfing campaign is being carried out by big internet platforms who benefit from the status quo, such as Google..Females build their own nests, but occasionally refurbish nests abandoned by other mud dauber wasps, particularly Sceliphron..It publishes a large number of editorial cartoon, on politics and society..With Corday's first solo exhibition: PROTOIST SERIES: SELECTED FORMS, presented at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.. Another girl from the class, @CAPS5; and myself were working on a special project. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot. As we were walking we passed by the office doors, the @CAPS6 hall, and the library. Just as we were about to walk by the copy room door, I saw @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was in my @CAPS1 Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him. I did, I then asked if he was taking @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that year. He replied with a no. I told him, ""@CAPS10 thing, because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sucks!"" I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by the truck load in just a short while. Not five seconds after I had said that to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking.  After I had said bye to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 hurried me out the door and she burst into laughter. I was taken-aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about. It was right then that @LOCATION1, my @CAPS1 teacher, poked her head out the door and said to me in her thick accent, ""@PERSON1, I hear you don't like my class!"" I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. The kind of look that jumps on your face when you wish you had a rewind button for your mouth. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @CAPS5 gasping for air because she was laughing so hard. I redirected my attention to @LOCATION1, she was just standing there with an angry face covering up the laughter that was trying to break through. There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator teaches your next class. "
" School had just gotten out. It was the @DATE2 before my senior year. We had been planning this camping trip for the @DATE1 few weeks. We were so excited about it that that's all we could talk about. This would be the first camping trip we had been on without our parents. It would be the best four days of our lives. Sand, the beach, friends, quads, no parents; how could it possibly get any better than that?  We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people that were there, the more fun it would be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I did all the shopping the day before. We got lots of yummy stuff to make. After we got home from shopping we had to load all the bikes in the toy hauler. We each took two bikes, and we took @ORGANIZATION1's boyfriends bikes over so he could just drive over after work. We were up almost all night packing, trying to figure out the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a nice weekend at the coast, we could already tell. It was the middle of @DATE3, the sun was shining and it was beautiful outside. The next morning we got up and double checked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes, and those sorts of things. Then it was off to get gas and finally head to the coast! Once we got on the road the music was blaring and the windows were down, just like always. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there. When we finally did get there, there was a really cute guy setting up his tent in one of our camp sights. I asked @ORGANIZATION1 who he was and @CAPS2 told me it was @CAPS1 (her boyfriend) best friend, @PERSON1. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came over to help. The second I layed my eyes on him, I knew he had to be mine. In the next hour or so we got all unloaded and set up.Eupithecia bifasciata is a moth in the family Geometridae..Golisoda (English: Banta) is a 2016 Indian Kannada-language film written, directed by Raghujaya..The tour visited all continents, except Antarctica, and was ranked as the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2012 by Pollstar..However, in the extended edition of the film, the second verse is sung later as the reprise when Troy and Gabriella are at their homes..From Moon Lake a portage led to South Moose Lake and the Saskatchewan River..Released on June 3, 2016, in the United States, the film received mixed reviews and grossed $208 million worldwide..It flows into the Schwalm in Alsfeld..He later worked as a University professor in Marketing..The word itself is derived from the Greek ""phleb-"", meaning vein, and ""a-"", meaning without..Aid climbing has its own ranking system, using a separate scale from A0 through A5.. By then many more people had shown up.We helped everyone else get all their things unpacked and set up so we could go on a ride. Our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect. It was warm enough to ride in t-shirts. We didn't stay out for long though. People started to get hungry so we went back to camp, made dinner and sat around the fire. There was probably twenty or so of us sitting around the fire, talking about everything from the stars in the sky, to the sand on the ground. Every time I would look up I noticed that @PERSON1 was looking at me. He would just smile, and look away like it was nothing at all. As usual, @ORGANIZATION1 started telling us about a funny incident that had happened to her in the @DATE1 ( @CAPS2 was such a klutz.)We all started laughing as @CAPS2 was showing us her bruises from falling down the stairs. @PERSON1 and i locked eyes.  Later that night @PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go on a walk. We walked all the way on the sand trail out to the dunes, and all the way to the top of a giant dune called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we got to the top we sat there, staring at the stars, talking. We realized we had lots of things in common. We liked to do all the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh.   Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, it means a lot. No one has ever been able to make me laugh the way that he does. I never knew that laughing could bring two people together the way that it did that one night at the dunes.."
" I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh, is a greatly valued thing. Sometimes just sitting around and telling old stories, or playing board games can leave you with a sore gut because you have been laughing so hard. Many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh. I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them. Family vacations are always chaotic, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another. Every winter our family gets together and goes to @ORGANIZATION1 to stay in our cabin there. A long weekend full of good food, trips to the mountain, snowball fights and family games, is a great environment to spark some laughter.This content is produced for Mediacorp's television and online platforms, such as mass entertainment Channels 5, 8, U, Suria and Vasantham..Meru is a census town in Sadar, Hazaribagh (community development block) of Hazaribagh district in the Indian state of Jharkhand..Her career high in doubles was at 85 set on 20 November 2000..To overcome this limitation the concept of reclassification, that is how well a new model correctly reclassifies cases, was introduced through the metric of NRI..Labor became the largest party on the council, which was under no overall control..It outcrops from Pulaski County, Arkansas in the east to Atoka County, Oklahoma in the west, a distance of over 200 miles..Christian became an MHK at her first attempt for the Ayre constituency in March 1980, but failed to be re-elected in 1986..It is endemic to the Guangxi province in southern China, and only known from an underground stream in Tian'e County..Following a fatal mishap with one of these aircraft at the former Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, the Coast Guard returned the remaining E-2Cs to the Navy and disestablished its NFO program..Some have been known to grow to 20 lb.. Every year we bring big family games such as @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. My family members and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room in which the game is being played, tends to escalate almost through the roof. The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments over things like ""how in the world is that a picture of a sock!"" or ""That's not fair, you know the actual definition!"" I enjoy these times because they are memories that you can hold onto forever. Laughter is a part of happiness, and happiness needs to be a part of life. Spending time with those who make you laugh, are those that are worthy of your time. Wiser people than myself say that ""life is short."" I'm starting to realize that this statement is true. If life is short, then that time should be spent in the best way it can be; moments filled with laughter. "
" My boyfriend and I planned to go to the @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fair that they put in @LOCATION1, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and surprisingly my mom said ""yeah you can go"" i was really exited cause that would be our first @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 together. We were thinking of how it would be and we laughed because we were saying ""what if we were on a ride and we fell out,"" but knowing it wouldn't really happen. The day before @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 i got all my things ready for that day. i was really exited and nervous cause I've never been on rides like that so i probably didn't go to sleep till @NUM4 in the @TIME1.  @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was on a @DATE1, I didn't wanna go to school so my mom let me go to the fair instead of school. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face because of all the things that were going through my head. I got ready, my boyfriend @PERSON1 his brother and his sister came to pick me and my friend up around @TIME3. We drove to the @CAPS9 station, parked and got our bus fare. After we got on the @CAPS9, we took a seat and we were taking pictures and making jokes. Since we got in the @CAPS9 it their was nothing but laughter. I'm pretty sure the rest of the passengers thought we were crazy. It took about @NUM6 minutes to get to were the fair was at, when we got off the @CAPS9. We ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't @NUM7 so they weren't opened so we had to wait @NUM8 minutes till they opened the gates. Once we got in this lady was selling a card that had the tokens in it, so we bought it and got on a spider ride which at first didn't look as scary but it moved really fast so i was sliding everywhere. @PERSON1 and his brother were laughing at me and my friend @ORGANIZATION2 cause we were yelling but after a couple of seconds i stopped yelling and i ended up laughing for no reason i just laughed and laughed until i finally stopped and we got off.Of the 274 Chamber seats, 265 were taken by the National Peasant's Party and nine by the German Party..A retired educator from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Womble is currently serving in his ninth term in the state House..A refrigerator death is death by suffocation in a refrigerator or similar appliance such as a freezer..He served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2008 to 2016, representing a district based in Gadsden County and Tallahassee in Leon County..Simple E was signed to Fox Records, who then released her only album, Colouz Uv Sound on October 11, 1994..The film stars Jagapati Babu, Rajendra Prasad, Madhubala, Gouthami, Kasthuri, Indraja in the lead roles & Ramya Krishna in a cameo appearance and music composed by Koti..Hand-for-hand play usually starts when the next player (or players) to leave the tournament will be the last place at a given payout..The Winston School is a private coeducational day school in Dallas, Texas..It has been the subject of legend, and the circumstances surrounding its construction and its builder were considered miraculous by the Sisters of Loretto..However, the use of these famous characters is what gives the show its emotional punch: even these beloved child characters must some day grow up and deal with a harsh reality as they find their place in the world.. After that ride i wasn't really in the mood of yelling or looking dumb in front of the other people that were at the fair so we didn't get on any for a while until we saw the @ORGANIZATION3 wheel we got on it. It was fun but it moved a lot so it reminded me of what @PERSON1 and I were talking about ""that how funny would it be if we fell out."" so i held the pole that was in the middle and @PERSON1 and them started to laugh so i let go and started laughing to cause the were making weird faces at me. When the ride was over we got off and went to go get something to eat from a tent that they had at the fair that was selling food, drinks and a lot of other things. We all bought a big bean and cheese burrito, @ORGANIZATION1, churros and an elephant ear. It was so good we wanted to buy more but we didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear and I was the only one that actually ate all of it. So they started laughing because they we saying ""if you could eat two big elephant ears you could probably eat an entire elephant"" I laughed with then then said ""I bet I could, I'm just playing but these elephant ears are really good so I would eat twenty elephant ears"" they laughed and laughed so i just laughed with them as well. After I got done eating, we walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had. Their was a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater. But the bad thing was that we didn't have enough money for the sweater or for the rides so we just choose to go on all the rides and if we had left over money we would go back to buy a sweater. Then we pasted by a photo booth were they took a picture of you dressed up as if you were a pilgrim. I thought it was funny so i started laughing and my friends started to laugh as well because they didn't know what i was laughing about until i told them. Then they started laughing even more. We got on the last four rides and it was about @TIME2 we had to leave so we left waited for the @CAPS9. As we were waiting for the @CAPS9 two security guys come on their two horses and I thought its weird seeing horses in the city, we started to laugh. We got on the @CAPS9, took some pictures and went home."
" The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air-restricting snowsuits. She opened the wooden front door and the chilly air stung my nose. @CAPS6 we hurried out into any @NUM1 graders paradise. @CAPS1 and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. @CAPS1 had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door we were stopped by @CAPS1's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and gulped down a tall glass of juice. @CAPS6 we flew out the back door with our sleds. There the giant hill waited for us. It slopped downward in a perfect @NUM2 degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow I heard @CAPS1 yell, ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her. I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.  Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see @CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away.1996 World Mountain Running Championships was the 12th edition of the global mountain running competition, World Mountain Running Championships, organized by the World Mountain Running Association and was held in Telfes, Austria on 1 September 1996..On 22 January 2014, a strong French column of more than a hundred soldiers transported by armored vehicles out of the city of Timbuktu and turns towards the northwest, then turns east after traveling fifty kilometers..Although the Republicans gained a plurality, the Democrats narrowly maintained control of the House with minor party support, forming an alliance with the remaining third-party Progressives and Socialist Meyer London..Cow Harbor Day is an annual festival celebrating the history of the village of Northport, New York, which was once known as Great Cow Harbor..Kalwi & Remi is a Polish DJ duo formed in 2003, performing electronic music..122 units have been built..Secularism is a divisive, politically charged topic in India..Ignite / Good Riddance is a split EP by the hardcore punk bands Ignite and Good Riddance, released in 1996 through Revelation Records..The idea is, then, that there exists an equilibrium point of virulence, where parasite's fitness is highest..Castles with existing parts from the Middle Ages are Antique White.. As I got lost in my thoughts about @LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot.  By the time I reached my final destination, @CAPS1 couldn't breath. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill. She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier. Finally when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. ""@CAPS9 like a nice hike,"" I said. @CAPS6 we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it.  When I came shooting down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that snot bubble out of her nose like a rocket ship, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that both of us felt at ease with our hardships. Laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other. When I laughed, my mind shut out the whole world. On snow days we now laugh to remember that cold @DATE2 day, but on that @DATE1 day we were laughing to forget.  "
" My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.Podalonia hirsuta is a species of parasitoidal wasps in the family Sphecidae..The Halloween special aired on October 19, 2011, drawing 2.5 million total viewers..Dawid Murek (born 24 July 1977) is a Polish volleyball player, a member of Poland men's national volleyball team in 1996-2008 and Polish club Espadon Szczecin, a participant of the Olympic Games Athens 2004, Greek Champion, three-time Polish Champion..The shirt is usually worn with a red fez hat or the Igbo leopard cap..The American badger (Taxidea taxus), on the Indiana threatened list is known to inhabit the area..The MONA or Hodges number for Metanema determinata is 6820..The district was named after the town of Anamaduwa in Puttalam District, North Western Province..A less advantageous result gives rise to the emotion of disappointment..Its most distinctive feature is a mine-clearance blade, it is most often towing a wheeled trailer loaded with additional equipment..Korea came calling in 2004, spending two seasons as an Assistant Coach at two clubs before getting his NBL break in 2006 as Head Coach of the Townsville Crocodiles..  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment."
"                   The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS3. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet.His father, Scott Garnett, also played professionally for the 49ers..R.R.

Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?"" ""@CAPS6"" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?"" I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS6"". He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner."
" i woke up at @NUM1 from a cal from my cousin saying he wanted to hang out and introduce me to my cousin i have never met before. after we got off the phone i hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as i could. once they got to my house i frantically ran to the door and opened it really fast expecting some kind of reaction from my new cousin, but the one i got wasn't what i expected. right when i opened the door he began cracking up laughing at my for a couple of minutes. i got kinda mad at him because i didn't know what he was laughing at , until i looked down and realized i had no pants on, i rushed back into my room and put some shorts on and came back into the living room while they were still on the coach laughing at my stupid mistake.Prior to the election, Mahathir led (as Prime Minister) the first Mahathir cabinet, a coalition government that consisted of members of the component parties of Barisan Nasional..From 2001 to 2006, he also served as an advisor to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Harold Brown..Group winners were Spain, who pipped Yugoslavia by a single point..The system was closed on 31 December 1929..The SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54..It was created in early 2011 to support the 2011 Syrian uprising..All here not listed AF lenses without an autofocus motor do work fully, but lack autofocus-function on these cameras..Dayton Family and Twista who were out at the same time in the early 1990s ushered in the fast style rap when it gained popularity in the mid-1990s with the emergence of award-winning rap artists such as the Cleveland-based rappers Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and Chicago-based rapper Twista..Since 2005 there have been no Jesuits at Canisius..It covers systematics and botanical and zoological taxonomy, ecology, ethnobotany, archeology, and related issues of the neotropical region, with emphasis on Colombia.. i sat down on the couch across from them and asked them what they were laughing about and that i did it on purpose for a joke, they didn't believe me at all, i don't blame them because that was the stupidest thing to say in that circumstance.    after they stopped laughing my cousin asked me if that was the only thing iv done like that,i replied no, and he started on about some stories about him doing dumb stuff like i did, that ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day, just reciting dumb stories about ourselves that were embarrassing. it turns out that just because i made that dumb mistake it made it easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in and just for that reason we have had a good relationship since we met .in the end i was glad i did that because it made us really close because we can now just laugh at each other when either of us do stupid stuff. and that's my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and i."
"                                   @DATE2 I woke up on a very beautiful day. The sky was clear and the sun was shining, which was unusual for a day in @DATE1. I got out of bed, as I usually do. I ate my breakfast, went to the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I left the house feeling a bit tired but great. As I walked to my bus stop, I watched people go by, saying @CAPS4 every now and then. When I got to my bus stop, @CAPS5 one was there. I thought that maybe the bus had already come and picked the kids up.  I waited and waited. Almost fifteen minutes went by. I was starting to get worried. If I had missed the bus, I couldn't go to @ORGANIZATION1. My parents worked until the @TIME1 and there was @CAPS5 one to drive me there. I then decided to walk to the next stop. @CAPS5 one was there either. By that time, I was sure that the bus had come earlier and left me behind. I started to walk back to my house. When I got there, I opened the door and went to check the @ORGANIZATION1 calender hanging on the wall. There was nothing written on @DATE3. @CAPS7 was a normal @ORGANIZATION1 day.  @CAPS2 could I have missed the bus? I never miss the bus! I started to ask myself of other possibilities. Maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed. That wasn't possible because the weather was great. Maybe something happened to the bus, like an accident and @CAPS7 couldn't come, but that wasn't @CAPS7 either because then the kids would have been at their bus stops. The more I thought about @CAPS7, the less @CAPS7 made sense to me.The song was written especially for Cher by Diane Warren, who produced it with Guy Roche..Until the disbanding of the Bezirksoberliga Schwaben in 2012 it was the eighth tier..The magazine is a strategic partner of the APEC CEO summit..Lead single ""Bloody Mary (Nerve Endings)"" was released via the band's official YouTube channel on March 25..The Unwritten Law: A Thrilling Drama Based on the Thaw-White Case is a 1907 film produced by the Lubin Manufacturing Company, based on the true crime story of Harry Kendall Thaw's murder of Stanford White over his involvement with model and actress Evelyn Nesbit..Forward propagation can be used to predict the influence of inhomogeneous, nonlinear media on acoustic transducer performance..It was presented by Monty Halls and co-produced by the BBC Natural History Unit, Discovery Channel and Digital Dimensions..He is a member of Uganda Medical Lab Association and the NRM Parliamentary Caucus and serves on the Committee on Physical Infrastructure in the 10th Parliament of Uganda..Dead Men Tell is a 1941 mystery film starring Sidney Toler, who played Charlie Chan in 22 feature films, beginning with Charlie Chan in Honolulu (1938), and ending with The Trap (1946)..Despite this, it looks somewhat rectangular because it is seen from its side as viewed from Earth, almost in the plane of its equator.. What was going on that day? I got frustrated. I set my backpack down so that I could look for my daily planner. I opened @CAPS7 up and searched for the @ORGANIZATION1's phone number. Then, I took the phone and called the @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1've reached @ORGANIZATION1,"" a woman on the phone said. "" @CAPS2 @MONTH1 I help @CAPS1?"" ""@CAPS3, I'm a student there and I was wondering if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus today?"" I said. There was a moment of silence. The woman didn't answer me. This was making me angry. ""@CAPS4, are @CAPS1 still there?"" I asked, with anger showing through my voice. Nothing. Then, the woman started laughing. @CAPS8 laughed for almost a minute. This had made me mad. What had I said that would make her laugh like that? ""Was @CAPS7 something that I said?"" I asked. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS5, I'm so sorry,"" @CAPS8 said, trying to keep herself from laughing. "" @CAPS5, @CAPS7's just that, do @CAPS1 know what day is today?"" ""@CAPS7's @DATE3, isn't @CAPS7?"" @CAPS8 laughed again. ""@CAPS5, today isn't @DATE3, @CAPS7's @DATE2."" I was shocked to hear that. I had spent all of my time trying to figure out what had happened. The only possibility that I hadn't thought of was that @CAPS7 was @DATE2. I felt like an idiot. I set down the phone and started to laugh. I laughed and laughed like I hadn't in years."
"                                           ""Laughter"" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter.NFTO Pro Cycling (UCI team code: NPC) were a British UCI Continental cycling team, until October 2016..Kong Jie defended the title for a third straight time, second behind Takemiya Masaki's record of four straight..Yatesville Creek flows into the Mohawk River in Randall, New York..On April 14, 1921, Schwalbe completed the purchase of the Keystone hotel property in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, with the intention of razing the buildings on that property to develop a modern motion picture theater that would seat 1,200..Recurring actor Kai Owen was promoted to the main cast in series three, in which David-Lloyd too was written out..Surviving, he returned to full flight status, flying the SR-71 Blackbird..The chieftain of Karwas fort along with Motumal aligned with Sindia and planned a conspiracy to kill Maharaja Bhim Singh Rana..This can also be termed as a situation when a producer or supplier bypasses the normal channel of distribution and sells directly to the end user..Anderson was executive producer with Tom Gutteridge..Mordellistena luteorubra is a species of beetle in the Mordellistena genus that is in the Mordellidae family, which is a part of the Tenebrionoidea superfamily.. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too."
" Laughter is the key I think that being happy is a big part in life because, being happy feels so good. If I was in a relation ship that was not happy I would not like it at all. In a happy relationship comes laughter,the first thing I do wen I meet someone I always smiling and telling jokes because if I tell jokes and they are laughing they know that I am a happy person. If you meet any person weather it is a grown up to a friend to a person you want to go out with they will always enjoy laughter. Lets just say me and my girlfriend when I first saw her she was sitting in a desk in my history class crying and I asked if she is okay and she told me her story after she told me her story I told her how it feel and then I told her a joke and she laughed.After she got done laughing she ask me for my phone number and then that night we started dating. I asked her what she likes about me and she said the way I make her laugh.  I always love to make my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile.In the theory of dynamical systems, amplitude death is complete cessation of oscillations..This show is a spin off of the show Kumkumapoovu..Nicholson is a Canadian folk, pop singer and songwriter..A T.P.I.N. is obtained by any organization that may need it via an SSL connection over the Internet from the CCR..In 2017, Fortune magazine ranked EY 29th on the 100 Best Companies to Work For list..Kyranna of Thessaloniki (1731-1751) was a Greek Orthodox saint..Before the Las Vegas show, runner-up Bo Bice came down with serious stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital..The title is a reference to the famous ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy in William Shakespeare's Hamlet..Happily their friendship survived and the two have since performed and recorded together, releasing an album Hummingbird in 2002..In II - III century AD in fact, this area was occupied by the Romans.. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and my self. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy it would be a better place because I rather laugh and be happy then be mad or sad about something. when I was growing up I was by myself all the time so i had to learn how to keep myself happy so I would think about funny stuff I have seen or said in the past and try to make a story about it and it worked.When I got older i started doing stand up comedy. It made me feel so good seeing all the people laugh. then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night I will never forget that night.If i had to pick what I wold want to do for fun I wold be a comedian.Thank you for reading this and have a nice day"
" My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past trageties, future mishaps, and current mistakes--loss. Life is a puzzle i can not figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I pounce into life. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way--to long. It sends the wrong message to those who can not tell if the mask is real, or perfectively put on.There were 12 songs in the final, with the winning song chosen by a 50/50 mix of televoting and ""expert"" jury..Although not strictly a silent film, it is unusual in having little dialog; instead, the film is punctuated by grunts, other vocal noises and sound effects..She also represented Nigeria at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics in Beijing, China..Andrew Paul Nii Amu Darko (born 1995), known popularly as Darkovibes, is a Ghanaian born singer, songwriter and fashionista..The radio show was first broadcast live on September 21, 2006..There are at least two described species in Ligurotettix..He was the son of the eques Publius Vitellius, and belonged to the gens Vitellia..Mahd al Hayl is a village in Makkah Province, in western Saudi Arabia..The reserve gives shelter to the last colonies of Long-tailed Chinchillas in the wild..Vattinagulapally is a village and panchayat in Ranga Reddy district, Telangana, India.. That is the message I want to give, right? Pretty soon, my laughter diminishes, my smile lowers, and my lips began to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding, and being squeezed at the same time. The eyes are becoming moist, they began to sting, and reden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me. Only pushing me to breakdown, which is something that is unexceptable. Peace, is the only thing needed at the moment; and of course, my best friend, tissue."
"  It was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 of @DATE1, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ORGANIZATION1 to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION1, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade? I was with my best friend @PERSON2 and her family. There float was for @ORGANIZATION1. Which is the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that they had owned at the time.   We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only @PERSON2, @PERSON2's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float.   @PERSON2 and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin baby's. I cant remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well behaved baby's, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed to hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly.  We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while @PERSON2 and I had started to get tired from holding the baby's and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though.   The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail.   Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's.It is one of the oldest representations of this theme..The Lebtheinia mine is a large iron mine located in central Mauritania in the Adrar Region..Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, commonly known as Mbale Hospital is a hospital in Mbale, Eastern Uganda..In January 2012, the principal actors re-signed to star..The group reformed in 2013 and released Wheels in 2014..It read beta and gamma and had a transistorized circuit..Tumor suppressor candidate 3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TUSC3 gene..He became a very well known psychoanalyst and was one of the first to deal with the trauma of aging..Theodore Fritz (born August 27, 1851) was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate..DQ won and represented Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song ""Drama Queen"".. At the time I was holding the girl and @PERSON2 was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The baby's were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had.  The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red. Baileys mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the baby's off to the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 manager who was there. Then @PERSON2's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time @PERSON2 even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore.  At the end of the parade @PERSON2's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle marks kids, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa @PERSON4 had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @PERSON2 and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that.  That @ORGANIZATION1 was a good @ORGANIZATION1 for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON2 and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense, and laughing at our selves had made us much closer.   Every relationship whether its intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will effect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives."
" Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked.Forty-five thousand racing fans would attend the event, interrupted by 0.31 inches or 7.9 millimeters of precipitation, shortened to the shortest race in what is now the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series by percentage in Darlington history (51.50%, 189 laps, which is six laps more than an official race, which is 184 laps), as the race was shortened because of impending darkness (Darlington did not add lights until the 2004 Southern 500)..Phaenopsectra profusa is a species of midge in the family Chironomidae..Massive is the debut full-length album from Californian ska band The Dingees..He started his career in 1987..He is the brother of former Banker's Association of the Philippines (BAP) president, Lorenzo V.

To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH1 never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS6 it up"" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away."
" During the @DATE1 of the sixth grade @CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON1's house.   ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 father"" @CAPS4 @CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5, @CAPS8's @CAPS9?"" I asked him.   ""@CAPS10 need to come home, @CAPS10 @CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers."" @CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS9 in @CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue @CAPS8 was happening, I was only @NUM1 and vaguely knew @CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS9 the phone and ran into @PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS4 @CAPS18 or @CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about @CAPS8 @CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS8 @CAPS4 father was doing, where @CAPS4 @CAPS18 was, and whether or not @CAPS4 sisters were @CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS9 the phone on @CAPS4 father. I had never hung @CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS4 @CAPS18 came to pick me @CAPS9 after @CAPS4 two week extended stay at @LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS4 @CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON1's @CAPS14 had called mine several times during @CAPS4 stay.It is a registered charity, and is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS)..Marielund is a locality situated in Haparanda Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 1,726 inhabitants in 2010..In 2012, Big Bad Boo won the number one spot at Mipcom Junior in the top 30 most viewed children's shows..Molicola horridus is a species of tapeworm..There have been three versions of George Taylor Richardson Memorial Stadium, a Canadian football stadium located on the campus of the Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario..Alexandra is a significant town in Victoria, Australia..51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland is an Adaptable Force Brigade of the British Army..Waipa is a former parliamentary electorate in the Waikato region of New Zealand, which existed for various periods between 1876 and 1996..The ROKN expects it to make up a major part of the fleet..Written by Richard Price from a story by Ed Burns & Richard Price, and directed by Agnieszka Holland, it originally aired on November 5, 2006.. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS8 was I supposed to do? @CAPS4 parents were splitting @CAPS9! @CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS4 street and drove towards @CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS4 room, leaving @CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS4 bed longing for @CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS9 in the @TIME1 on @CAPS4 own. There were so many things that @CAPS4 father did that @CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS4 @CAPS18 sent me and @CAPS4 sisters to @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house in @LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS8 was happening. @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS4 @CAPS5, not @CAPS4 @CAPS17 or @CAPS4 @CAPS18, just @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and maybe @PERSON1.  When I came home from @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS8 was going on and how @CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS12 was, so @CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS4 father called me at @LOCATION1's house."

We headed out from the house at about @NUM2 o'clock pm. When we left the house we headed for one of our friends house because we asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left we had to leave fast so we were not on the the road for a long time. When we got to our friends house we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They got all ready then at about @NUM2:45 we all headed out. All together now there was about @TIME1 of us about to head up on gillhooly on this ride.  When we finally got to the top of the mountain it was about @NUM4 o'clock pm.

Then about @TIME1 we shot all of them off. There was only about @TIME1 or @NUM7 of them. We started to head back home at about @NUM8 in the @TIME2 but one of our friends got stuck in some snow off the side of the road.

"                                                  Laughter  Laughter, how do you define it? The non-existence of happiness? Without laughter, @CAPS1 would be no smiles. Without smiles, @CAPS1 would be no affection. Without affection @CAPS1 would be no emotion. Without emotion, @CAPS1 would be no re-action. Without a re-action, everyone around you would be blank. Laughter; it can do so many things. It can bring people together or even tear people apart. It can be a way @CAPS2 express yourself, or even a way @CAPS2 put up ""your walls."" Laughter could mean so many different things. It can show so many different different things. It can show so many emotions, or even hide them.An Ivanhoe best and fairest winner in 1959, Lewthwaite was a member of the Victorian Amateurs team that competed in that year's AAFC Perth Carnival, then represented the VAFA again in 1960 and earned All-Australian selection..Following strong viewing figures, it was announced on 2 March 2017 that a third series had been commissioned..In 2014 the Western TV show The Pinkertons was filmed entirely in Grosse Isle and even used local houses and barns for most scenes..Manolito y su Trabuco is a salsa and timba group out of Camaguey and Havana, Cuba..It is held by the wife of the Duke of Rothesay since the first Duke in 1398..Prior to the war the ship, built in 1908 in Germany, was SS Cincinnati of the Hamburg America Line..She is the fastest spinner on ice in the world ever clocking at six rotations a second..Responsible Research partners with PRI signatories and asset managers to analyze the trends of ESG practices, and the impact of disclosure on Socially Responsible Investment portfolios in Asia..It develops music recording, arranging and editing software, notably Cubase and Nuendo..In March 2007 the MetroCenter was voted #2 Top Performing Arts Venues in Fort Worth by the Fort Worth Business Press..

When really that's not at all the emotion they are feeling. @CAPS1 not laughing because @CAPS1 all around a happy person. @CAPS1 laughing @CAPS2 hide the true pain they are feeling inside, because whether they like it or not no human can completely let ""it all on the line."" @CAPS2 be so vulnerable anyone could get in and cause pain. So how important is laughter @CAPS2 you? In and kind of relationship laughter is important. W heather it be a friendship, a marriage, an engagement ect. @CAPS2 know how your partner is feeling can make all the difference. So one laugh or giggle could make turn it all around. Laughter it's the shortest distance between two people."
" Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE1. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM1 minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME1 fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME2 for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent.The single reached number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 2 on Mainstream Rock Tracks..Konopnica is a village in the municipality of Vlasotince, Serbia..She is portrayed by Stana Katic..He was born in Melbourne, and attended St Bernard's College in Moonee Ponds and then Monash University, where he received a Bachelor of Economics, and Hawthorn State College, where he received a Diploma of Education..Tiddington railway station was on the Wycombe Railway and served the village of Tiddington, Oxfordshire..It is a heavily residential area being in the wealthiest portion of both Orange County, California as well as the city of Newport Beach..He finished his high school career at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts..Ptycholobium Harms Pyranthus Du Puy & Labat Requienia DC..He had a particular interest in liver disease..Richard Marx contributed backing vocals as an unknown until his 1987 debut album appeared.. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME1, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME2 my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME1 was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME1. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME1. It was the @TIME1 together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful."
" Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When your angry, sad, nervous or even mourning. Laughing about the good times @CAPS1 had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in someway or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought. Which made me look on the positive and light-hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, some times hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There was three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what, it was so many years ago. But then on boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes were all eight or nine years old but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says ""@CAPS1 are not in shape, your fat"". This crushed me how was I suppose to reply to this. I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear repeating in my head those evil words that stung me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I could not hold back the tears.Hohlbach is a small river of Hesse, Germany..Chief William Stamm said the repairs were normal, and that the new vessel was safer than Deluge..Us' request for jurisdictional discovery and dismissed the case over lack of personal jurisdiction..On 3 December 2013 TEOCO, a telecom software firm based out of Fairfax, VA, acquired Aircom International for an undisclosed amount..Sandade Sandadi (English: Fun and Fun) is a 2002 Telugu Comedy film, produced by Adityaram on Adityaram Movies banner and directed by Muppalaneni Shiva..The episode was written by Nichole Beattie and Seth Hoffman, and directed by Seith Mann..Neuwirth continued to devise further medical procedures and many of his independently-created products were later sold to Johnson & Johnson, as well..Paine's brick row-house development on Greenwich and Sussex streets in Roxbury, Massachusetts is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Frederick Douglass Square Historic District..Dokshytsy District is a district in the Vitebsk Region, Belarus..It charted at number ten in the UK, becoming their second-lowest-charting single to date.. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out if this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter then to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed ""@CAPS2 what's the matter, what happened?"" @CAPS3 tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boys name. I told her @PERSON1. She began to laugh and say ""That chubby kid with the buck teeth?, oh honey don't let that bother @CAPS1 he isn't in shape at all"". I started to laugh realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, which the statement were not even true and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what @PERSON1 said to me. Of course even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless commend about any of this flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation, also. "
" A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 was a warm @DATE1 @CAPS1, some of my friends and I had planned to spend a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @CAPS3. We had decided on walking around and looking @CAPS2 all the cool stores. Eventually we would all get lunch and go out to the park near the river right next to the @CAPS3. We all agreed that @CAPS4 was a great plan and we would all have a wonderful @CAPS1. To start off, we all met @CAPS2 the bus stop by the movies. @PERSON3, @PERSON4, @PERSON2, @CAPS5 and I were all there. We decided to go look inside @CAPS6 @CAPS7 first because they have all the crazy things we love. Inside the store, I found a dress that was to die for. @CAPS4 was small and grey with skulls all over @CAPS4. Unfortunately, @CAPS4 costed @MONEY1 that i did not have, so we left @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Next, we went to @NUM1 @CAPS10 to see what they had in store for us. @PERSON3 and I created a black teddy @PERSON1 with a studded leather jacket. We gave @CAPS4 an awsome top hat and named @CAPS4 @CAPS11 @PERSON1. We all thought @CAPS4 was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary. We paid @MONEY2 for @CAPS4 and continued on our little adventure. We all decided @CAPS4 was about lunch time so we went and got chineese food from @ORGANIZATION1, left the @CAPS3, and headed down to the park next to the river. Before we got to the park, we stopped to go see what @CAPS4 was like under the bridge. There were towers of rocks all over the place, so we decided to build one of our own. We stacked @CAPS4 up almost as tall as me before @CAPS4 toppled over, almost crushing @PERSON4 on the way down. We followed the little path away from the rock towers down to the river. @CAPS4 lead us to a little beach next to the water. There was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water. We decided to eat lunch here instead of going to the park. After eating lunch, we were all full of energy again.The earthball may be parasitized by Pseudoboletus parasiticus..Dolly Sohi Dhanowa is an Indian television actress, known for playing the leads in shows like Bhabhi (TV series), Kalash (TV series)..The continued growth and operation of the agricultural industry in the Okanagan absolutely depends on the employment of temporary migrant workers..During the Cold War, it was part of Strategic Air Command, equipped with Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium bombers until its inactivation in 1964..From 1987 to 1991 he was President and CEO of Distinctive Software Inc. of Vancouver..The film revolves around a woman who plunges into a river after her boyfriend refused to marry her, but is saved by another man of inferior caste whom she gets married to..He served as Chief Justice from 2009 to 2011..She has also collaborated with musicians, including Paul Reller and Benjamin Wynn..It was described in 1957 by Ermisch..Drita Islami is at the same time national record holder of Macedonia at 400 meters hurdles.. @CAPS5 started a pine cone war by tagging me in the back of the head with one. After a few minutes, all of us were involved. We used the giant pillar from the bridge as a shield but @CAPS4 didn't quite work. @PERSON4, who had a better aim than all of us, was hitting everyone left and right, so the rest of us teamed up on him. We all threw pine cones one after the other untill @PERSON4 had to start backing away. As he reached the edge of the shore, he tripped over a big rock and fell backwards into the shallow water. Instantly, we all busted out in a roar of laughter that continued on for a good couple of minutes before @CAPS5 finally decided on helping @PERSON4 out of the water. He was very unhappy about the situation while we were all quite pleased. Jesica had managed to get a vidio of the whole thing and when we played @CAPS4 back to @PERSON4 he couldn't help but laugh with us. After that, we went to the park. Immediately, we all ran for the slide. ""I wanna go first!"" screamed @PERSON3 as we all made @CAPS4 up the jungle jim to the slide. All of us pushed and shoved to get to the slide before I finally suggested going down the big, swirly slide all together. Everyone els thought @CAPS4 was a great idea so we attempted @CAPS4. @PERSON3 was first, as she wanted, I was second, followed by @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and then @CAPS5. We started off realy slow and progressed in speed as more of us piled onto the slide. We ended in a pile @CAPS2 the bottom, all laughing histarically. When we all came back to reality we realized @CAPS4 was time to head home so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop. In the end, @CAPS4 had turned out to be an even better @CAPS1 than we had expected. The whole @CAPS1 was full of joy and laughter, whitch are a few of the key aspects of life. Without laughter, there would be no way to @ORGANIZATION1 when you are extremely happy or when you think something is funny. Happiness is one thing you need to live a fun, fulfilling life. I feel like the ability to laugh is one thing that makes a person fun to have around. Do you think you laugh often enough?"
" Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my @CAPS1 tell a very good joke. I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your @CAPS1. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @CAPS1 are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh.       My best friend @PERSON3 and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year @PERSON1 always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when @PERSON3 and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the tv show @CAPS1. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Her face would turn as red as a tomato and I just couldn't even say a word. Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something. Now that's when my @CAPS1 start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious.      @PERSON3 and I are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun.Bisexual flowers are borne singly or in clusters opposite the leaves..New Xanagas is a village in Ghanzi District of Botswana..In computing, dir (directory) is a command used for computer file and directory listing, specifically in the command line interface (CLI) of the operating systems CP/M, MP/M, DOS, OS/2, Singularity, Microsoft Windows, ReactOS, and in the DCL command line interface used on VMS, RT-11 and RSX-11..Unofficially, the station prohibited students from DJ'ing any longer when Andrew Pozner and Jeremy Hover played unedited songs by the infamous rap group named The 2 Live Crew..WSU's popular mascot, ""Butch T. Cougar"" was named the 2006 CapitalOne Mascot of the Year..In November 1918, after the First World War ended, the territories of southern Carinthia and southern Styria, which had been claimed by the Republic of German Austria, were captured by military units under Maister's command..As shown in the diagram above, a planet (or other object) can be at the western quadrature (when it is to the west of the Sun when viewed from the Earth) or at the eastern quadrature (when it is to the east of the Sun when viewed from the Earth)..Acrochordiceras was described by Hyatt in 1877 and is known from Eurasia, Timur, California and Nevada..There are not only puppet performances but also extraordinary shows with actors and puppets acting at the same time on the stage..Richard Shelter was an integral part of the South Florida punk rock scene.. Some teachers appreciate that we actually have fun in their class but others just don't like it at all. Like last year in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 our teacher @PERSON2 completely freaked out because @PERSON3 and I were laughing. We were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he didn't like it. To us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but @PERSON2 decided to make a sitting chart. Well you would think that by having a sitting chart @PERSON3 and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that didn't happen. That didn't stop her or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and we made class fun. When he thought that we weren't paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly. Even though @PERSON3 and I were sitting far away from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word.  Every day when my @CAPS1 and I eat lunch at school at our usual spot we're always laughing. People that don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say that I'm just myself and that I'm very optimistic. @PERSON3 and I say ""@CAPS4 sad panda's today"" we say that when we see that one of our @CAPS1 is quiet or looks sad. The most weirdest thing is that when @PERSON3 and I laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh. The first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe. It's important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved even if you're having a really bad day, like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile."
" Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life.Kenya Harlequin Football Club, (Harlequins or Quins for short) is a Kenyan rugby union club that competes in the Kenya Cup, the top level of Kenyan rugby..In public services, automatic enrolment defines programs where citizens are automatically included unless they opt out..The long saga between Tanoto's Indorayon with local community ended up with the status of closing down during the President Wahid administration..On September 24, 2010, it was reported that Sweetland had been hired by Sony Pictures Animation to direct a computer-animated film adaptation of The Familiars novel series; that project has been canceled..Part of the Sidama Zone, Arbegona is bordered on the south by Bona Zuria, on the southwest by Bursa, on the northwest by Gorche, on the north by the Oromia Region, and on the east by Bensa..On June 24, 2014, a Virginia vacationer became buried alive in beach sand when trying to dig a tunnel, and then died..The park is owned and administered by Mumbai-based Takshila Seas & Resorts Private Limited..The contestants will camp in Krabi..Peter O'Toole's role in the film led him to be cast as the lead in Lawrence of Arabia two years later..It had a circulation of over 40,000.. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist."
"                                        Laughter  @CAPS1 I first meet someone there is always a small wall to climb before we can really get to know eachother: @CAPS2 laugh. I have this weird awkward nervous laugh, almost like a giggle, that I don't even hear. Others do though. Especially when they first meet me. I think that most times it helps people get to know me faster. But other times, I think it is a hindrance to getting to know me.  When someone first meets me they usually always comment on @CAPS2 laugh. They either seem slightly thrown off by it, or they easily open up and joke around with me. They always tell me about it: @CAPS3 odd it is, @CAPS3 much I do it, what it's like, etc. As if I've never been told about it before. But, this is fine. I don't hear it come out and I don't mind being told. I don't really think of it as a bad thing. When they seem thrown off by @CAPS2 laughing, I get more awkward and try to control it, but usually end up doing it even more. If it seems to make them laugh and they don't make fun of me for it, I just let it come out, and it becomes very easy to get to know that person. I never really realized just @CAPS3 bad it was, until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with @CAPS2 youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt.Stadium was the home of the International League's Charlotte Knights from 1990 to 2013..Critical Beatdown is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Ultramagnetic MCs, released on October 4, 1988, by Next Plateau Records..Together with Hfq it positively controls motility and negatively controls the production of acidic exopolysaccharide amylovoran in E. amylovora..The Social factory is a concept developed by Italian autonomist Marxism in the 1960s to help analyze how capitalist social relations had expanded outside the sphere of production to that of society as a whole..All soldiers in the Squadron are trained in rigging and dealing with underslung loads which can be carried by a variety of aircraft including both AgustaWestland Merlin and Boeing Chinook..He represented Great Britain a year later, at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, where he finished fourth in the men's marathon in 2:17:02.4, just 43.2 seconds behind then-reigning world record holder Basil Heatley, who took second place..The Blaw-Knox company was a manufacturer of steel structures and construction equipment based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania..A condition of the planning consent was that the hall be restored..Finland-based Rovio Mobile's 2009 game Angry Birds, which recently passed the 100-million download mark, won the award for Best App of the Year along with a win in the Best Game App category and a nomination in the Best Time Waster App category..Doug Suttles is President and Chief Executive Officer of Encana Corporation..

When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just @CAPS3 weird @CAPS2 voice, laugh, and mannerisms are with strangers. People had told me about them from time to time, but I'd never seen it. It was weird! Another situation was working at @LOCATION1 this @DATE1. When we did icebreaker games to break tension and meet the people on our teams more easily. Everyone on @CAPS2 team seemed slightly weirded out by me. I couldn't figure out why, until one person would just step up and be straightforward: and inform me of @CAPS2 laugh. As the first week went by though, I was the person that knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be bridged quickly, or made greater: depending on @CAPS3 people react to it. If they join in it together, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person doesn't join into the laughter, or doesn't enjoy the other person's laugh, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes hard to breach this distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that is just too bad. We should all be able to laugh together and share in eachother's joy."
" Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activites, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adament about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM1 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up.In November 2007 Keith released an album titled KeCraig..Sui Southern Gas Company transmission system extends from Sui, Balochistan to Karachi, Sindh..The Soviet Union finished at the top of the gold and overall medal counts with 8 and 16, respectively..For example, some types of neocognitron can detect multiple patterns in the same input by using backward signals to achieve selective attention..It was re-released in September 1999 on Metal Blade Records..This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis..The Association for Project Management (APM) promotes the professional disciplines of project management and program management in the UK, where it is the largest professional body of its kind..Previously, Weiser was the associate athletics director at Oregon State University..Abraxas adilluminata is a moth of the family Geometridae..Thomas Miller (born 29 June 1990) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for League Two club Carlisle United.. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now everytime I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten."

"            ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 you ever felt it? The feeling of uncontrollable joy building up inside you? The one feeling you @CAPS11 never explain in any word but one. Laughter. This is a wondrous feeling, it @CAPS11 make you do so many things, like scream, and yell! Someone once said, Laughter, is the beauty of life. It helps us get out of hard times, and @CAPS11 always put a smile on our face when we @CAPS2 down.It will make good times even better and never be forgotten. Laughter is something everyone needs. It helps us connect with people. It will causes you to be come one with another. This is the story of me. The story of how laughter caused me to meet the love of @CAPS7 life. How the connection of joy between us will last forever, and how the memories of his smile will last in me forever.  @DATE1 was the day i met him. It was a gorgeous day, snow was covering the ground for miles, and I was surrounded by @CAPS7 amazing friends. The feeling of boredom quickly flew over our heads. So we decided it was time to @CAPS1 some fun. We quickly put our snow cloths on and began running for the door. The moment we stepped out side everyone but me stopped. I kept going into the ice cold air. I slowly began to realized they had stopped and I tried to come to an immediate halt. They all began to laugh as i laid on the icy growned holding @CAPS7 soar butt. I was so embarrassed, and so shocked by @CAPS4 had just happened that i didn't move, I just laid back and closed @CAPS7 eyes. As I was laying there I began hearing foot steps. I figured they were just @CAPS7 friends coming to help me. But when i opened @CAPS7 eyes, it wasn't @CAPS7 friends I saw. It was a hansom man, one I had seen few times before in @CAPS7 high school. @CAPS3 leans down and ask me, ""@CAPS2 you okay?"" I reply in a shy tone,""yes..."" @CAPS3 smiles and reaches down to help me up. As our skin gently touches I get butterfly's all through out @CAPS7 body. I look at him and @CAPS11 tell @CAPS3 was getting the same feeling. As i stand to @CAPS7 feet we both smile and begin to laugh.Obarde is a village in Pljevlja Municipality, in northern Montenegro..ASL is now the main language that is used by the Deaf community in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island..For example, in the sentence ""Susan ate an apple"", Susan is the doer of the eating, so she is an agent; the apple is the item that is eaten, so it is a patient..Pathologic gamblers have higher activity in the dorsal visual processing stream including the cuneus relative to controls..It is native to northern Australia where it is largely restricted to the Kimberley region of north-western Western Australia..Elections to the Adur District Council were held on 7 May 1987, with one third of the council up for election..It is named after the 1974 film Thieves Like Us, directed by Robert Altman..Although the matches had been arranged well in advance of the World Cup, the mini-tour was seen as an opportunity for South Africa to showcase their talents and to say farewell to their outgoing coach, Jake White, who retired after the second game..R-tools are a set of Unix/Linux tools that allow basic unsecured administration of Unix/Linux systems by establishing a Remote Shell..The concrete spire passes through a wide disk holding water fifty meters above the ground..

I reply.I begin to thank him and ask if @CAPS3 would like some hot chocolate or coffee. @CAPS3 reply's in a cute tone that sent chills up @CAPS7 spine. @CAPS3 says ""I would rather take you to get a burger, will you come?""A huge smile washes over @CAPS7 face as i say ""yes."" @CAPS3 grabs @CAPS7 hand and walks me closer to @CAPS7 friends. They all began to smile and turn and walk away quickly into the depths of @CAPS7 house. @CAPS3 smiles and decides not to follow. We both begin to laugh as we run over to his car. I @CAPS1 heard a lot about @CAPS6, @CAPS7 friends @CAPS2 always talking about how cute and muscular @CAPS3 is. The first thought that went streaming through @CAPS7 head was, I cant believe @CAPS3 wants to take me out to lunch!  We sit awkwardly in the car all the way to a small dinner called @ORGANIZATION1. When we stop @CAPS3 jumps out of the car and rushes to @CAPS7 door to open it. @CAPS3 is such a gentle men i thought to myself. When we get to our table @CAPS3 orders for us both and asks me all sorts of questions. @CAPS3 kept me smiling the hole time! I don't think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and @CAPS3 drove me home we smiled and laughed as @CAPS3 told me joke after joke. When we reach @CAPS7 house @CAPS3 asks me a question. A question i will never forget. ""@CAPS11 i kiss you?"" @CAPS3 asks. I do not answer but lean in and kiss him. We look into each others eyes after wards and begin to laugh.. Why we laughed i still will never know. But at that moment i fell in love. At that moment i realized laughter will be the connection between us forever. The laughter is in remembrance of him. @MONTH1 @CAPS3 rest in peace...  "
"Like all great things in life, laughter is the thing that keeps me going. Without laughter I'm depleted. I'll tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. First is @CAPS1 mom. (@LOCATION1) @CAPS1 mom is the one that showed me, laughing is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to fall down. Laugh at the fact you're silly, you messed up but make sure to get back up. @CAPS1 mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @CAPS1 teenage ""drama"" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I just don't want to be me anymore to laugh through it. When me and @CAPS1 best friend got into a fight @TIME1 @DATE1 I didn't come out of @CAPS1 house for about a week and a half, I didn't want to talk to any of @CAPS1 friends. @CAPS1 mom tried to get me to call her but I never did, till one day @CAPS1 mom sat down on @CAPS1 bed and said ""@CAPS2 it's not want happens to you it's what you do with it, do you hear me laughing all the time, when I'm upset, sad and happy...that's what I want you to do no matter what is going on in your ""drama"" teenage life don't shrug it off @CAPS2 laugh it off, call her.""@CAPS1 @CAPS5 friends definitely take second place. Like @CAPS1 friends, I also have @CAPS5.Geeving is the debut studio album by Canadian electronicore band Abandon All Ships..He is a visiting professor and lecturer at the University of Moratuwa and a board alumnus of the Open Source Initiative..Caelostomus obtusus is a species of ground beetle in the subfamily Pterostichinae..He played in three qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup..GLORAD is directed by professors of each hosting university..He attended Oklahoma State University and received a B.A. and M.A. in Accounting and in 2016 he was awarded an honorary PHD in Accounting..Misiano-Genovese is the initiator of the Altered Lithograph, Excavation Collage and Novel..In the Forest is a 2002 novel by Irish novelist Edna O'Brien..The film stars Richard Pryor as a blind man and Gene Wilder as a deaf man who work together to thwart a trio of murderous thieves..While most students come from the Hamden Middle School, many others come from private and magnet schools in the surrounding area.. When I'm with them nothing else phases me, the whole world could be ending and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel since I have @CAPS5 I speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @CAPS1 friends with @CAPS5. @CAPS1 friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing that they taught me is having @CAPS5 is a gift and a curse. When @PERSON1 and I are hanging out it doesn't matter who we're around we make there day, we can't help feeling goofy plus the non-stop laughing. Sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not.Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I'm a total comedian. When I try to be funny I'm not that funny but when I don't try I make people laugh so hard they cry. @CAPS1 whole life I've been told ""@CAPS2, wow you really are something no matter what mood someone's in you just make life seem so amazing."" @CAPS11 people laugh is one thing but @CAPS11 myself laugh is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS1 room @TIME1 I was thinking about @CAPS1 past life and became pretty upset but to pull myself out of the negative thinking I started thinking about the good times I've and within five minutes I was laughing so hard @CAPS1 stomach hurt.     Like I said ""like all great things"" laughter is @CAPS1 greatest. Laughing really can open someones eyes. I will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes.  "
"In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all is very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of iteracton with someone. Laughing says,""what you are saying is funny"" or, I'm enjoying this"". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. Its so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that, we love the feeling we get when we are with them,and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe its a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe its at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, its always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life.Even immature animals can be easily distinguished from other mostly black and white tegu species by the ""singe mark"" on their nose..Records is an independent record label, music publisher and management company based in Nottingham, England with offices in London and New York..Arnold Ilagan Atienza (born September 29, 1972), also known as Ali Atienza, is a politician, athlete, and newscaster in the Philippines..It is listed on the Zagreb Stock Exchange and is one of 25 companies included in the CROBEX share index..In the early 19th century, it was a drapers shop..The Tamil film Muthu (1995) directed by K.S.Ravikumar and starring Rajinikanth is a remake of Thenmavin Kombathu..It was released in October 1992 in Latin America, United States and Europe..Today, one can find Punschkrapfen in most pastry shops and bakeries in Austria..Michael E. ""Mike"" Randall (born November 2, 1953) is an American actor, playwright, meteorologist and reporter from Buffalo, New York..He joined Pumas for the Apertura 2007 tournament, on a loan from his club Tigres UANL.. Im not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, i feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps,what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right."
" It was my first year of @CAPS1. high school and I was feeling pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going awesome! I had woken up on time, eaten a good breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang I hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. One of my close friends had called my name so I turned to wave and when I turned back I ran directly into @LOCATION1. We hit hard. I flew backwards dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened.   After lunch I had @CAPS2. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, @PERSON1, was in it. On my way there I made a quick pit-stop to the ladies room to make sure I still looked decent and then headed to class. As I walked in the room the first thing I saw was @PERSON1's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye. Then I registered the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eye lashes at my dream guy! You got it, @LOCATION1. From that moment on it was war! As the year progressed @LOCATION1 and I constantly strove to out do each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind @PERSON1. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new hair cut and she would get high lights.Very Best of Dragon is a compilation album by the New Zealand band Dragon..In 2007 he received the Bradley University Department of Engineering Outstanding Achievement Award..There are around 40 species within the genus, although a number have been reassigned to the Iridopsis genus..Bonaville Township is a township in McPherson County, Kansas, in the United States..However, just two months later AT&T announced that the subsidiary was being sold to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA)..People's Party of Catalonia (in Catalan: Partit Popular de Catalunya, PPC) was a political party in Catalonia, Spain..The organization has over 75 staff, in a mix of regulatory, research, policy and development roles..She became popular as ""The Imaginary Girl"" in the romantic comedy telefilm Monkey Bizness (2015)..Most students reside in Buffalo City, Cochrane, and Fountain City..There is a complex verbal nexus attached.. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show @PERSON1 this new game I'd learned. But of course when I walked in the room @LOCATION1 was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had over @LOCATION1, books. Both @PERSON1 and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made @LOCATION1 jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of the sudden @LOCATION1 appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. @LOCATION1 and I stood there glaring at each other, rage searing from our eyes until some one broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including @LOCATION1 and I. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up.  Eventually we became really good friends. To this day we still laugh about or @NUM1 grade rivalry."
" Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day. All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends.The deserted village of Glendon is in the English county of Northamptonshire..Wade Dokken (born March 3, 1960) is an American financial writer and businessman..1884 was the 98th season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)..It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, and now serves as a museum boat..The Bishop of Derby was a suffragan bishop of the Church of England Diocese of Southwell in the Province of Canterbury..Mister Bahamas is pageant that was established in 2012..Bragmanni were unclothed, cave-dwelling wise men who were extremely moralistic and ascetic..As well as singing, he was the keyboard-player of the London-based new rave band Klaxons, disbanded in 2015..7 events (3 men's, 3 women's, and mixed play) were contested..He joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor in 1965, becoming a Senior Research Scientist in 1978, and remained a member of the MIT faculty until his death.. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS3"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes. I knew this was different tho. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time."
"I have lived in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost my whole life, I went to pre @CAPS5 all the way up to @NUM1 grade. @CAPS7 was about half way into my @DATE1 when my mom had told me the ""@CAPS3"" news. Honey we are moving, i froze in shock i didn't know what to think, no we can't move. why she said, um maybe because im going into @CAPS4 @CAPS5.

After the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean. We cleaned from the up stares all the way down, head to toe that took us about two days tops to do.

We went up stares and picked out our rooms. there was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share. When we where all done with that we stared to unpack our stuff.

" Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed too do. It frustrated me so much, I started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @DATE1. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at @CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @NUM1 years ago. My brother decided that he want too take me on @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about @NUM2 or @NUM3 time. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk too him for the rest of the day.Jean Barnabe (born 3 March 1949) is a former Congolese cyclist..The 2013 Red Deer municipal election was held Monday, October 21, 2013..Players attempt to gain Victory Points by solving the murder, solving the conspiracy, and/or resolving the investigators' personal issues..A naturally strong swimmer, Frank gets an idea while on a 'booze cruise' with his friends to swim the English Channel..It was named after the grandson of the discoverer, Alex Baltutis..Nirel (English: Shadow) is a Tulu film directed by Ranjith Bajpe and produced jointly by Shodhan Prasad and San Poojary, starring Anoop Sagar, Varuna Shetty, Deepthi, Sachin Padil, Deepak Paladka in the lead roles..Since 2003, the Dutch football Talent of the Year may choose a location for a new court..Ten years later the Hillsborough Disaster would prove these fences fatal and his concerns irrefutably correct..In some other languages the ranges corresponding to color names do not necessarily agree with those in English..Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown won the award for Best Film.. He finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. And too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the @DATE2 because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in @NUM4 grade when my best friend @CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about @NUM5 hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got too talk too him. Only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is @CAPS5, she was about @NUM6 months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about @NUM6 times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. Those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh too help me feel better when I was feeling upset, or down."
"Have @CAPS3 ever had that one moment with some that @CAPS3'll remember forever and laugh about every time @CAPS3 think about @CAPS2.? @CAPS8 I have and I think that everyone should have a moment of laughter in there life. On the day of @DATE1 was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 decided that @CAPS1 wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. @CAPS1 called me around four in the morning saying that @CAPS1 was starving and that @CAPS1 needed some food in his stomach. So @CAPS1 picked me up around five am and we went to @ORGANIZATION1. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @PERSON1 wanted to go for a drive, let me remind @CAPS3 @CAPS1's from @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 has @CAPS6 clue where anything is in @LOCATION2. So as we head out of town I am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his @DATE2 poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here @CAPS3 need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @CAPS3're probably going to get stuck where ever @CAPS3 go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but @PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe @CAPS2 was time to go home. When we came up to another road @CAPS1 decided @CAPS1 was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. @CAPS1 seen the sign for the street but @CAPS1 turned the wrong way into a field. @CAPS2 was okay, @CAPS8 as first @CAPS2 was . Until @CAPS1 went to back up, and the car wouldn't move. I looked at him and laughed and said ""I told @CAPS3 that @CAPS3 needed to go right not left.In 1990, Gilchrest defeated Dyson 57% to 43% despite again being badly outspent by Dyson, who received substantial PAC contributions in all of his later campaigns..It is widespread all across Eurasia..New American Music Union was a two-day summer music festival scheduled on August 8 and 9, 2008, at the SouthSide Works in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania..Hydrolaetare schmidti (Schmidt's forest frog) is a species of frog in the family Leptodactylidae..Candler-McAfee is a neighborhood located to the east of Atlanta, Georgia and to the south of Decatur, Georgia in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States..As such, parents and caregivers are frequently asked to provide pertinent information..Stephen Wayne Prator, Sr., known as Steve Prator (born September 25, 1951), is the first Republican since Reconstruction to serve as sheriff of Caddo Parish in far northwestern Louisiana..It has been implemented in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States..In corpus linguistics a key word is a word which occurs in a text more often than we would expect to occur by chance alone..The valley's numerous springs include Cool Tank, Mahogany, Moody, Little Nevada, Pogue Wells, and Soda Springs.."" @CAPS1 then looked at me and said, ""@CAPS2's not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we'll be out."" One thing that @PERSON1 did not know is that @CAPS2 had been warm in @LOCATION2 the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @CAPS1 might not want to @CAPS5 that but @CAPS1 said that is was fine @CAPS1's done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. @PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to @CAPS5, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because @CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @PERSON1 had one more thing that @CAPS1 wanted to try, because @CAPS6 offense but @CAPS1's a boy and they can @CAPS5 everything themselves. So @CAPS1 told me to get into the car and put @CAPS2 in reverse so I did as @CAPS1 said, then @CAPS1 said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, @CAPS8 I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and @PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. @CAPS2 was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what @CAPS1 deserved because @CAPS1 wouldn't listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but @CAPS2 just wasn't working. I started to laugh and @CAPS1 looked at me and said, ""@CAPS3 think this is funny?"" @CAPS1 then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. @CAPS8 to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and @CAPS3 remember how I told @CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse @CAPS8 when @CAPS1 pulled me out i didn't take @CAPS2 out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, "" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 have an extra key on @CAPS3 by chance?"" ""@CAPS6"", @CAPS1 said, ""@CAPS7?"" I looked at him and said, ""@CAPS8 lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and @CAPS8 to finish @CAPS2 off the doors are locked."" @CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. @CAPS2 took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then @CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to get @CAPS2 unstuck. When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about @CAPS2 to this day."
"Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On @DATE1 the morning of my @NUM1 birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that ""things were going to be okay"". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will @CAPS1 be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for @NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter.Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi visited victims of the crash on 15 January, pledging to hold those responsible to account..Calling Zero is an album by Go Back Snowball, a side project of Robert Pollard with Mac McCaughan, released in 2002..He received a bachelor's degree in finance from Brigham Young University and later received concurrent master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, an MA in International Studies with an emphasis on East Asia from the Lauder Institute and an MBA from The Wharton School..In 2015, she won the City People Entertainment Awards for Best Supporting Actress..The plot revolves around the premise that Lazarus of Bethany, the man resurrected by the hand of Christ, became an immortal creature of Judgment, seeking the hearts and souls of the wicked..Cycling at the 1974 Asian Games was held in Aryamehr Sport Complex, Tehran, Iran between 5 and 14 September, 1974..Light Organ Records is a Canadian independent record label, based in Vancouver, British Columbia..Like other historical BC regions, it is sometimes referred to simply as The Lillooet or even Lillooet, (i.e. without meaning the town of the same name)..Prior to his current assignment he served as the Director General of Doordarshan News for over 3 years..In the context of the Five Towns, ""The Hewletts"" or ""Hewlett"" is often used to refer collectively to the hamlet of Hewlett, together with the villages of Hewlett Bay Park, Hewlett Harbor and Hewlett Neck, along with Woodsburgh.. Growing up my mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine"". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that ""sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?"" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends."
"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing.The George Gustav Heye Center is a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian in Manhattan, New York City..Futurist theater also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theater via parody and other techniques..Currently buffalos can be found naturally in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia (although domestic and feral populations have been introduced in Europe, the Americas, and Australia)..Agyneta alboguttata is a species of sheet weaver found in the Comoro Islands..Lexical choice is the subtask of Natural language generation that involves choosing the content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) in a generated text..The Gallong or Galo language is a Sino-Tibetan language of the Tani group, spoken by the Galo people..Some of the northern suburbs of Johannesburg are now served by the new Gautrain rapid-rail system..Willard Pearson was a United States Army Lieutenant General who served as commander of the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division during the Vietnam War and later as commander of V Corps..Omugabe is the title that was used for the king of Nkore..Hrishyamukh is also part of Tripura East Lok Sabha constituency.. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said "" oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to ""quotidian teens."" I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said "" hello @PERSON3, good luck in track."" @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said ""@CAPS16, you talked to your husband."" We laughed for a long time. @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @CAPS20 music, @CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; @CAPS3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you @CAPS3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you @CAPS3 if it is as @PERSON1 said ""jump of a cliff, @CAPS3 built your wings on the way down,"" or someone will help you built them!  As @PERSON6 said ""come take my hand, we'll walk this road together.""   "
"  I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON1. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, ""@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS5 will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""""@CAPS7"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I...Cassidy earned an Emmy Award nomination for Best Dramatic Actor for the role..Greig was never allowed to forget that comment, although in a subsequent interview many years later he recounted that his comment was born out of frustration with the journalist interviewing him at Hove in early season 1976..The Leinster jurisdiction covers counties the traditional Irish province of Leinster in the Republic of Ireland..Today these franchises can be found throughout New England, though most locations are in southern New Hampshire..TDVision Systems Inc is a company that has designed products and system architectures for Stereoscopic Video Coding, Stereoscopic video games, and Head Mounted Display..In late 2017, Chinese scientists traced the virus to cave-dwelling Horseshoe bats in Yunnan province..Ilyushin was also very aware of the vulnerability of the system to combat damage, but he was ordered by GUAP to use this system..Arbacia dufresnii is a species of sea urchin of the family Arbaciidae..Another is to take advantage of increased economies of scale..Omphalomargarites is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Trochidae, the top snails.."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.   "
"So one day I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So go check my email, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I got excited to talk to him becuase I got my phone taken away. I open it, and it was a break up email. It was so shocking. I wanted to cry. So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON1 and tolled her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON1 said yes to comeing over! @PERSON1 is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do, and say when I'm upset. I was waiting for her for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she out doing things. She finally gets to my house, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for one a other. I have always been there when all of @CAPS1 boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as any boyfriends as she had.Tirhandils sail well and are an attractive vessel with plenty of deck space..In most events, championship matches occur..Designed and built by Blackburn Aircraft, 42 were built..SPASS-XDB can thus incorporate facts coming from relational databases, web services, or linked data servers..Marzuki Elias is a Singaporean footballer who played as a left-back for the Singapore national team in the 1984 Asian Cup..Bettie Page Reveals All is a 2012 documentary film about the life history and cultural influence of Bettie Page..As a child, she took music and dance lessons..In 1055 however Gruffydd ap Llywelyn killed him in battle and recaptured Deheubarth..Local elections were held in Marsabit County to elect a Governor and County Assembly on 4 March 2013..Rolling Stone selected the film's performance of ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" as one of the ""50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll"".. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river fellowing down my face. Being dumped really is a horriable feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so the he dmped me was very unlike him. @PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was think why are you just texting you should comforting me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So started to talk and we desided to go to the mall. Thats always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She just got home. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere was better any home at that time. So we went back to my room, I was crying again. So @PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew the things weren't true, but it was really really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @PERSON1 making up stupid ex-boyfriend jokes! Laughter is the best way to make everthing better!"
" I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad.Calcification is synonymous with the formation of calcium-based salts and crystals within cells and tissue..It is a member of the connection game family inhabited by Hex, Havannah, TwixT, and others; it is also an early member in a long line of games Ea has developed, each game more complex but also more generalized..The individual then operates in their lives with the expectation that this model is largely correct, and strives to revise the model when his/her experiences can not be interpreted as compatible with the current state of the model..It was established in 1912, originally in a barn owned by Martin Hogan..The coils are switched on and off in a precisely timed sequence, causing the projectile to be accelerated quickly along the barrel via magnetic forces..The Optometric Extension Program (OEP) is an international, non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of the discipline of optometry through the gathering and dissemination of information on vision..Nayakan released in 1987 was dubbed as critics as India's answer to The Godfather..It is one of the first programs in the United States that addresses the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) cancer survivors and those at risk and the only one founded and directed by members of the LGBT community..Although there are close connections, All Things Ransome is a completely separate organization from The Arthur Ransome Society (TARS), a British-based literary society focussed on Ransome..The website was founded in September 2002, and has attracted approximately 60,000 members, including paying subscribers.. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know ""live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it."" I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa"" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @CAPS1 your blue just think about something that will always make you laugh and laugh about it."
" Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means their happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling to happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to and them laugh. laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today, We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance now @CAPS2 we want to laugh we need only to pick up remote and turn on the @CAPS1, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to go and see a stand up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the very first time someone laughed comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed. I remember that when ever my parents would have a new friend over then only thing I would hear when they were at my house was then sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing.As a single population, Afro-Mexicans includes individuals descended from Spanish colonial era transatlantic African slaves brought by force to Mexico, as well as others of more recent immigrant African descent, including Afro-descended persons from neighboring English, French, and Spanish-speaking countries of the Caribbean and Central America, and to a lesser extent recent immigrants directly from Africa..Tinaco River is a river of Venezuela..A 1988 lawsuit by the Bush Administration was settled in March 1989 with a consent decree signed by the union and the government that allowed the federal monitors..The Charles Brainerd House is a historic house located at 420 E.

Soon the new guest was over much more often.  Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more, @CAPS2 you have ever noticed men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them. This and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship. I have herd but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic, sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not felling so good so it @MONTH1 possibly be therapeutic for me. @CAPS2 this is so than people have been going through therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh even @CAPS2 the subject is not funny they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might fell kind of out of place. Everyone has a different laugh some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them, my mother has a very loud and high pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh, no matter what your laugh is like it can help you feel better it can also help you become closer to someone. laughing is just one of life's greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh."
"Library @CAPS1 @CAPS2 past @DATE1 instead of sitting at home doing nothing, I decided to get a volunteer job at the library. Some @MONTH1 say that a library is not a funny place but to my best friend @PERSON1 and I it was full of numerous and humerous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy whom we like to call @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the time that we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided that we were to loud and weren't to nice about telling us. We worked hard in that library but who says you can't laugh a little on the job?  @CAPS3 @CAPS4, by definition it means he is some one who likes to @CAPS3, but @CAPS2 guy was just to funny. One day @PERSON1 and I had just got done working and we were waiting for her grandma to pick us up, when some strange guy sits down and starts staring at @ORGANIZATION1 like he knew her. He then preceded to ask us countless questions like, ""@CAPS6 your names?"" and ""@CAPS7 you guys have boyfriends?"". Being me I didn't say a word and let @PERSON1 talk the whole time. He also kept telling us how beautiful we were, which made us laugh even harder because @CAPS2 situation just kept getting weirder and weirder. Since his nickname is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you can only guess @CAPS6 he asked us next. Oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start a @CAPS3 line in the middle of the library. Thankfully @PERSON1's grandma showed up just in time to save us and we only saw the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after @CAPS2 encounter. Being a spy was one of the most hardest and funniest things that @PERSON1 and I ever did at the library. It all started when we noticed @CAPS2 cute guy sitting all by himself at a table that we could clearly see through some book shelves not that far away. Being the adventurous type I talked @PERSON1 into letting me use her iPhone to take pictures of @CAPS2 guy without him knowing. Now some people would think that that was kind of like a stalker, I just saw as a chance to brush up on my spy skills. After successfully getting a couple of pictures undetected, I decided to get just one more before we went back to the other side of the library to see @CAPS6 we had.Springfield's most high-profile role was David Barnes in the PBS series Wishbone..The town is about 15 miles east-southeast of Fayetteville along NC 24..Much of the channel's output was made up of interactive programs and games which allowed the viewer to phone in or send an SMS message to take part in the program..The welding required a mere 8,000-lbs of welding wire by comparison..The arrondissement of Issoudun is an arrondissement of France in the Indre department in the Center-Val de Loire region..The EP followed their multi-platinum hit album Funky Divas in 1992..Sweet Baby James made Taylor one of the main forces of the ascendant singer-songwriter movement..In is the first country music studio album from Leigh Nash..Gary Steven Twynham (born 8 February 1976 in Manchester, England) was an English footballer who played as a midfielder for Darlington and Macclesfield Town in The Football League..Examples would be the British George Cross, and the American Lifesaving Medal.. I was just about to take the picture when I locked eyes with the guy who was not supposed to see me. We then had to abort the mission and crawl all the way to the other side of the library so he wasn't able to see us again, so that he couldn't confront us about why we were taking pictures of him. The funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were. Normally libraries are quiet, right? Well @PERSON1 and I had a little problem with people wanting the library to be to quiet. On one such occasion a nice looking middle aged women was doing some homework at a table not to far away form where we were sitting. We were watching some videos on @ORGANIZATION1's iPhone and we had the speakers on low. @CAPS2 lady told us very rudely that she wanted is to move somewhere else if we were going to have the volume up because she needed to get her work done. Not one please or thank you were said as we walked away. On a similar occasion an elderly lady who was sitting a few book shelves away form us also asked us to be quiet so that she could finish her book. @CAPS2 time the elderly lady used her manners but she had a very rude tone of voice. On both of these occasions @PERSON1 and I started laughing shortly afterward. @CAPS2 just goes to show how ""nice"" people can be when they want to get something done. All and all that @DATE1 was one of the most funniest summers I have ever had. Whether we were getting talked to by some guy who wanted to start a @CAPS3 line or getting caught trying to spy on a cute guy or even getting reprimanded by not so nice people, we could always find @CAPS1 somewhere. Not many people could say that the library was ever a place where they laughed so much they nearly peed there pants, but @PERSON1 and I can."
" It was the middle of @DATE1 and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten I still played with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on vacation surfing in @LOCATION1, or roasting marshmallows over the roaring fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring @DATE1 break anyone has ever had until one day in @DATE3. The day I met @PERSON1 was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON1 because of my brother and his sister, they had had crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents but, that also meant that her brother @PERSON1, and I, would have to tag along also. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only chuckled when I would crack a joke here an there. As time went on though, I must have grew on him, because a few days later he was laughing at practically every joke I made.  Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late @DATE2. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his family, and his good friend @CAPS1. @CAPS1 couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON1. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because why i hadn't was a good enough reason not to.  We spent half the night talking, and laughing, and really just getting to know each other better.Kit Taylor (born 1942) is an Australian actor, the son of Grant Taylor..Unlike apoptosis, cell death by pyroptosis results in plasma-membrane rupture and the release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules such as ATP, DNA and ASC oligomers (specks) into the extracellular milieu, including cytokines that recruit more immune cells and further perpetuate the inflammatory cascade in the tissue..Thrapston Town F.C. is an English football club based in Thrapston, Northamptonshire, and competes in the United Counties League Division One..Vaishnavi Mahant / Macdonald (born 9 September 1974) is an Indian film and TV actress who is best known for playing Geeta Vishwas in Mukesh Khanna's television series Shaktimaan, telecasted on Doordarshan..He had one of the highest batting averages in school history; batting over 700 during his Senior year..CFL on CTV was a presentation of Canadian Football League football aired on the CTV Television Network from 1962 to 1986..Paul Stagg Coakley (born June 3, 1955) is an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church..Full-custom design is a methodology for designing integrated circuits by specifying the layout of each individual transistor and the interconnections between them..The headquarters are located at Palacoderu town..At the 500 meters he reached the quarter finals, while at the 1500 meters he was eliminated in the semi finals, although he had the final in reach.. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when @PERSON1, and his family moved to @LOCATION2, where they were from. After they moved I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON1, telling me that they were going to move back.  I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. @PERSON1 came back for about another solid @NUM1 years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to @LOCATION2 again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. @PERSON1 had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes."
" I have a friend and her name is @PERSON1. I have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class. We have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship. About two years ago for her fifteenth bithday party she invited a couple of her friends and I to spend the day over at her dads house in @LOCATION1. The plan was to hang out, have fun ,and pretty much do whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a pool to swim in, and flatscreen television to watch movies, plenty of board games top go around, and quite a few people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @DATE1 we all loaded up the car around noon and made our way to her dads appartment in @LOCATION1. A short @NUM1 minutes later we had arrived at the appartment complex. We were all so excited to get the entire day to hang out, and have an amazing sleepover for @ORGANIZATION1's birthday. The second that the van had stopped all five of the people that were in the car including me unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up out of the seats to head to the house. Everybody had gotten there seatbelt unbuckled except for @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2. She had thought she heard, and felt the seatbelt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still on she attempted to jump up out of her seat but at the last second the seatbelt caught her by the waste and jerked her back down to her spot. She had layed there with her arms to her sides with her head all the way back against the head rest and moaned for a good ten seconds. This was one of the many events of laughter that had happened that day.The Tigers are a member of ECAC Hockey..The Full Range of Leadership Model (FRLM) is a general leadership theory focusing on the behavior of leaders towards the workforce in different work situations..The flowers have an insect-like labellum which is green with a dark green mound on its upper end.

A good two hours had gone by and the five of us were chillin' out in the living room and talking about what to do next. @PERSON1 had suggested ""@CAPS1 guys, we should all go to the pool for a couple of hours, swim, and tan."" The rest of us were all for it concidering the fact that it was probably one hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny, and clear, and because it was @CAPS2 @PERSON1 birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then after the conversation we all got our swim suites on, grabbed our towls, and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed out the door. Little did we know but the blacktop outside was boiling! Of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways. We all then took one step out on the blacktop, and all you could here was screaming, and yelling. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! @CAPS4 feet are on fire!"" @PERSON2 remarked. We had all agreed with her at that very moment of time. Since the blacktop was outrageously hot @PERSON2 started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later @PERSON2 had finally reached the grass and all we heard was. ""@CAPS6!"" all of us looked up at @LOCATION2. She was laying flat on her back because the sprinklers had been on recently and she didnt know so her feet flew right out in front of her and landed on her back. We all started laughing but running at the same time. I helped @PERSON2 get up off of the ground and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess that something else funny happened with @PERSON2."
"                                  ""@CAPS1 @DATE1"" @CAPS2 my brother graduated @CAPS1 year it was a great time in our lives . We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1 my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS2 he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS2 she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart.Comets have been observed by humanity for thousands of years, but it is only in the past few centuries that they have been studied as astronomical phenomena..To expand the knowledge of social psychology, Edwin P.

I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS2 we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS2 we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION1 before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON1 almost caught a huge @NUM1 inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.  "
" ""@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper.Wendy Sessions is a British ice dancer..The following is a list of Huawei phones..Gaming law is enormously complex..Minogue has also performed the song on most of her 2000 and onward tours, including On a Night Like This Tour, Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour, KylieX2008, For You, For Me Tour, Kiss Me Once Tour, and most recently on her Kylie Summer 2015 Tour..K S Makhan (born Kuldeep Singh Takhar) is a Punjabi singer..Overall turnout in the election was 27.3%..After the first two Baroness EPs were issued together as First & Second in December 2008, the group's second album Blue Record was released in October 2009..The group was founded by Chris Smith, a graduate of NYU, and Billy Scafuri, who graduated from Hofstra University, but both of whom are from Rockville Center, New York..The Budescu River is a tributary of the Ruscova River in Romania..Its substation name is Korea Job World.. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. ""@CAPS2?"" @PERSON3 asked tentavely. ""@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. ""@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond."
"                                                         Laughter and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Laughter is the key component in anything in life. @CAPS2 is able to turn any sad moment good and any great moment even greater. Here is an example in which laughter brought my boyfriend and I together. I had been crushing on the same guy, @PERSON1, for two months. I was way too nervous to speak to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When i saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me they heard from a ""little bird"" he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me into him then ran off. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in an awkward silence. All I did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes. All i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans. He probably thought i was a freak. He had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg.Palm prints can be used for criminal, forensic, or commercial applications..Paraplatyptilia is a genus of moth in the family Pterophoridae..Yerrobana Palle (also known as Yerraobana Palli) is a village in the town of Darsi in the Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh, India..The incident brought Clarke's cumulative career suspensions to 20 matches, which resulted in his deregistration under the nationwide Player Deregistration Policy, bringing an end to Clarke's playing career..The numbers refer to the location of the municipalities on the maps of the respective provinces..She had earlier appeared (as Randy Farr) in Big House, U.S.A.

Then when he went to switch to his left leg he let out the biggest fart i have ever heard. We started laughing. After we had settled down from laughing hysterically, we started talking. We ended up talking for two hours. A couple weeks had gone by and we had been talking more and more each day. Another week had flew by and we went to our first movie. I called @CAPS2 our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Ever since the day he farted I have thanked @CAPS5 for @CAPS2. I wouldn't have him as my boyfriend if @CAPS2 weren't for him braking the ice with his embarrassing moment. Most of all I thank my friends for shoving me into him that day. There could not have been a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much @CAPS2 @CAPS3 change or affect a situation. Laughter is the medicines of all medicines. @CAPS2 is one of the most important tools a person @CAPS3 have."
" Laughter is what I'd like to call a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3"". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In @DATE1 laughter was a big key in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION1.  Our @ORGANIZATION1 consists of around @NUM1 people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it @MONTH1 not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up to sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my @LOCATION1 decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes.  My @LOCATION1 is somewhat of a @CAPS4 of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out.He played several times for England at under-16 level..It hangs in the Lakeview Post Office located at 1343 West Irving Park Road in Chicago's North side..Vaudesincourt is a commune in the Marne department in north-eastern France..The album also features guest appearances by Fronz (Attila), Matty Mullins (Memphis May Fire) and Shayley Bourget (Dayshell, ex-Of Mice & Men)..Vic Dana (born August 26, 1940, Buffalo, New York) is an American dancer and singer..His consort was the goddess Damona..It was established in July 2009 as the newest, and one of the smallest, high schools in the U.S. state of Georgia..Many of these slaughters occurred in Muslim countries, and religious restrictions on the consumption of pork have been cited as influencing the decision to take such action..The album consists of 11 songs, which are individually named by a wide range of styles that are integrated into every song..Approximately half of the island is forested and has long supported a large colony of wading birds.. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the @ORGANIZATION1. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 help me"" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a @ORGANIZATION1 member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part.  In @DATE1, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!"
"          Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self . In my opinion.                         Laughing is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing about funny things. Laughing also make you feel close too people because once you and that person get to know each other you'll just laugh about anything even if its not that funny.For example when i first meet people i am very shy, I don't really say much but if the person that i am talking to makes me laugh, it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke around with them, it makes the conversation fun.  If there is no laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead. No one wants to be around a person with no sense of humor. In my opinion everyone has a funny side, some people like to show it and some people like to keep it to themselves. Some people might be funnier but the things is we can all be funny in our own way.  I've had many experiences where laughing has benefited my relationship with people. Me and my friend met in middle school ,I was good friends with his sister but i never really got to know him until I went to high school. I had a lot of classes with him so i started talking to him, but because i already knew him I wasn't very shy. The first day that I talked to him at school he was making fun of me but not an a mean he was joking around how I brought chocolates to his house and I didn't offer him any , it was more of like an inside joke. The thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around. So I immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think.The game was released in two parts: Tales of Bearsworth Manor: Puzzling Pages, and Tales of Bearsworth Manor: Chaotic Conflicts..Her closest opponent, comedian and Yale University graduate Steve Berke, garnered 23.38%, or 1,614..His work includes both experimental and theoretical physics..The asteroid 4816 (Connelly) is named after Robert Connelly..The Leica 250 FF was based on the Leica III, with slow speeds, and the Leica 250 GG on the Leica IIIa, with 1/1000 top speed..By studying Russian, Ing. Giuseppe traveled to the Soviet Union and sold two big contracts with their ministry Machino Import, of some 1000 cranes to be used in the enormous project of the Transiberian Pipeline..The main branch of the chain is the largest drive-in fast food restaurant in the world..The series was green-lit on May 11, 2012, with the premiere on February 27, 2013..She won gold medals in mixed doubles events with Kim Hyok-bong at the 2013 World Championships and the 2014 Asian Games..Paralomis is a genus of king crabs.. Now we are best of friends,we laugh about everything and we have are own little inside jokes.When I am talking to my friend I can say anything that I think is funny and I know he will laugh at it. Laughter has really made my friendship with my friend fun. One of the best relationships I have with a person is with my sister and its because we just laugh all the time when we are together . When either of us is going through a ruff time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while. Even though we are sisters and we naturally have a bond, laughter just makes are sisterly bond ten times better. We have very similar personalities, and we are both pretty funny so the laughing never stops between us there is always something we laugh about.  Laughing in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship, without laughter it would be a miserable, unhappy relationship. Laughing brings out the good side of people in most cases, it brings out truth in people. when you first meet people, laughing really makes conversation comfortable and not awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can really make you good friends for example like my friendship with my friend. When you are sad or mad,it really makes you feel better when you have someone that makes you laugh it just makes everything better it really can change some peoples mood and make them forget about the negative stuff in their life for a while. Laughter is just a great way to bond with people. Having someone to laugh with is just very important to have in life."

"Laughter A true story that involves @CAPS4 and laughter was when i was hanging out with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiance @PERSON4 (who is a profesional quad racer) at a @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2. The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM1 because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies.His last job before joining the Lions was as a member of the number two broadcast team for NFL on Fox, as well as being the color commentator for Monday Night Football on Westwood One..Health Psychology is a monthly, peer-reviewed academic journal published by the American Psychological Association..This song was also remixed for the 1984 album Thing-Fish..The Folgore is one of three light infantry brigades of the Italian Army..She was a Labor member from 2001 to 2015, and served as their leader and Leader of the Opposition from 2012 to 2015..Byer graduated from the University of Southern California and was on the staff with InterVarsity there for many years..It was originally formed in 1973 by linking together both the 8th and 9th Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment..He led the American League in hits in 1995 for the White Sox, and he led the National League in hits in 1996 for the Mets..The station will be built in Manchar a suburb of Pune..The Sky Hawk was discontinued for the 1957 model year.. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS11. A lot of things made @CAPS4 laughlike when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert and it wasnt as good. But it was still awesome."
" Laughter to me seems like the foundation of a relationship; if it is a relationship with your parents, best-friend, or your spouse, it can all be formed with a single laugh or giggle. I have seen on @CAPS1 that when a guy try's to ""pick up"" or ""hit on"" a girl, most of the time he will try to be funny to ""break the ice"". When that so called ""ice"" is broken the air is open for both people to start showing each who they are.  My best friend and I have been friends for five years now and I hope that we will be friends for more years to come. @PERSON1 (my best friend/and only friend) has shown me how to be myself @PERCENT1, with her and try to with others. Together @PERSON1 and I have had many funny adventures together, that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Just recently @PERSON1 and I went snowboarding at @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2. @CAPS3 was her second time going snowboarding and I have been snowboarding for about three years now. I promised her that I would stay and help her on the slopes until she got the hang of the board under her feet, I also promised that I would fall down with her when she fell. When we got there I showed her how to clip her bindings on, what the stomp pad was used for, and also how to skate.Richard Kruse (born 30 July 1983) is a British fencer who specializes in the foil discipline..Krishnagiri is a state assembly constituency in Tamil Nadu, India..Lewis was also a member of the Tampa Bay Storm and Toronto Argonauts..As each form of the attraction appeared, new technology has allowed the guest to better interact with the ride and even connect with personal computer users..The R48 is a provincial route in South Africa that connects De Aar with Petrusburg on the N8..It features Uncle Sam playing a snare drum with an eagle on his shoulder..Wirex achieved $1 billion of transaction volume in 2017..Spectrum Technologies PLC is a British company, based in Bridgend, Wales, which designs and manufactures specialized industrial laser systems..This is a list of songs that have peaked in the top 10 of the Mainstream Top 40 chart during 2010..He also appeared in a recurring role on the television series Da Vinci's Demons, as Nico Machiavelli.. The word skate means that your foot boot is in the front binding and your left foot is not, you push your back foot on the snow to slide or skate on to the ski lift. It took us three hours to get down the first bunny hill slope, normally it takes a person no more than ten minutes to get down. While teaching, laughing , and bonding with @PERSON1 I noticed that when I laugh with her I get feelings of love, caring, and happiness. Laughing with her always makes my day. In fact that is how we became friends; was by laughing together. After we got of the slope she said some words to me that I will not forget, ""@CAPS2 you are the best friend I could ever ask for, if you were a man I would marry you and have your children, I love you."" @CAPS3 meant a lot to me, for @PERSON1 is the kind of person that keeps her feelings of love and caring inside. @CAPS3 was the first time she has ever said she loves me. Laughing together for five years now has made it so that @PERSON1 feels more open with me, enough to say something that she never told to her family. Laughing and even giggling together is what @PERSON1 and I look forward to in our relationship. "
" When I think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. The happest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the coach. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him everythime. He had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plad tucked in shirt. We always played gold fish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run twards him when my other cousin @PERSON2 grabs me and starts to tickle me tell I fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON1 as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS3 tell I feel asleep.  The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up, when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchenI shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON1 and I startded to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curld up by the bales. Almost every foot step we took there was another snake curld up in the bales.Crown Center is a commercial complex located near Downtown Kansas City, Missouri between Gillham Road and Main Street to the east and west, and between OK/E 22nd St and E 27th St to the north and south..On the way, she takes on the company of a professional golfer and a rebellious pre-teen boy, and together they attempt to unravel the mystery behind her slain lover's past..Shingo Araki was the animation director and co-character designer along with Akio Sugino and Michi Himeno..He is a former fellow of Kellogg College, Oxford..OptaPlanner is an Open Source Constraint Solver written in Java..Manny Pacquiao vs. Lucas Matthysse, billed as Fight of Champions, was a boxing match for the WBA (Regular) welterweight championship..This beat was sampled in the song ""Another Trill N*gga Gone"", a Pimp C tribute by Young B. and A-Dub..Belenggu leads the nominations with nine nominations, with Rectoverso and Habibie & Ainun followed behind with eight and seven nominations each..Devanagari is used by most of the speakers..Some organizations have adopted the TBL framework to evaluate their performance in a broader perspective to create greater business value.. Every time @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting @PERSON1 figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON1 cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON1 finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visite in the house. @PERSON1 and I headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit.  The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done. When we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as I stood by @PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving good bye.  After we visited @DATE1 we got a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with some bad news. @PERSON2 was heading home and saw @CAPS5 truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE2 and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS5 room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him."
" I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON2 was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience. One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go.Polygamous marriages are not legally recognized in Mongolia..He was a good goalkeeper, but even a better friend..It is one of the key techniques in computational geometry..In humans, the Calcipressins family of proteins is derived from three genes..Upon its release, the album and its lead single of the same name became a chart-topper in various South Korean and international music charts..This signaled an end to the capital purchase program..Another theory is that interest groups govern..Their corruption grows until he can no longer allow himself to stand by and do nothing..Pilning is a village in South Gloucestershire, England, close to Redwick and Severn Beach..Gillian Hiscott is an author and playwright, born in Plymouth, Devon, United Kingdom, in 1959 whose plays have been performed both in London and at the Edinburgh Festival.. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @PERSON2 and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE1 when we would meet again at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 where we could do it all over, and make new memories."
"One time I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was going crazy. She would run up and down the stairs as fast as she could and no one had any idea why. I thought it was so funny, but @PERSON1 was getting super mad at @PERSON3. So eventually @ORGANIZATION1 into her room to see if she would calm down, but to her dismay @PERSON3 did not. She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder I laughed. It was like the most funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life. This dog had obviously gotten a hold of some kind of energy source to be this happen. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was, but @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something. So @PERSON1 and I went down stairs to see if her mom @CAPS1 knew why @PERSON3 was acting so ridiculous. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON3 never usually acted this hyper before.The Newton considers its internal storage, and each inserted card, as a separate ""store"" (a volume)..The episode was written by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Michael Watkins..The climbing takes place in three parallel canyons..Roger Hirst is an English politician, and the current Police, Fire, and Crime Commissioner for Essex, representing the Conservative Party..On the penis, it lies between the dorsal nerve and deep dorsal vein, the former being on its lateral side..AZ paid him with an all-in salary and when the transfer fund was raised Haatrecht would earn less money and he told both clubs that he would quit football if Willem II would not cooperate..Heidi El Tabakh (born September 25, 1986) is an Egyptian-born Canadian former professional tennis player from Toronto, Ontario..Users typically cannot understand programming language code area above all the others from one another the end..It features a complex arrangement of balconies and terraces and is representative of the American Craftsman style..Gazzara described his friend as a writer and director that totally believed in the importance and value of his work, because the work represented his heart and soul.. Then @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister came down stairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running to fast to catch her and was way to crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON3 back in @ORGANIZATION1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but to sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog. To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3, she was just insanely hyper and out of this world that @TIME1. So after @PERSON3 had calmed down about @NUM1 hours later, @PERSON1 and I went on a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4 and I was trying to explain to him the story of how @PERSON3 went crazy that @TIME1 and they didn't find it as funny as me. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining it to him, they had warned me I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing way to hard to notice and I fell. That was like the icing on the cake of @TIME1. I just sat there on the ground and laughed, and so did they. It was pretty funny! I haven't laughed that hard since then. The end."
" Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.Bill Connors (born September 24, 1949) is an American jazz guitarist who was a member of Chick Corea's band Return to Forever..Sunny Brae is a neighborhood in Moncton, New Brunswick..Sadie Park Grisham (July 22, 1859 - November 10, 1928) was an educator and municipal public office-holder..Casa Guazzoni is a building in Milan in via Malpighi 12 in the Art Nouveau style..It features Remo the Hitmaker, who co-wrote and co-produced the song along with G-Eazy and Christoph Andersson..With a lack of sleeping accommodation, patronage dwindled and The South Mail ceased operating in May 1985..World Is Static were the first band to be played on the test transmission of UK based radio station Ne1fm..Mattos Nascimento is a Brazilian musician, singer, composer and trombonist..He made his List A debut for Sussex against Netherlands on 20 May 2013..His sturdy but smokey vocal presence on ""Sleep Tonight"" foreshadows the strong and emotive singing on his solo records and later Rolling Stones tracks..  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION2 from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS4 horse called @CAPS4 @CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS6 know that @CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing. "
"                              @ORGANIZATION1                                    @DATE1 for my @CAPS1 birthday we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for a week, @CAPS16 was so much fun when we got there but the drive was not fun at all. When we got to the house that @TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS16 was coming down so hard @CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS16 seriously looked like @CAPS16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS9 get @CAPS16 because my @CAPS17 was ""too tired"" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like ""@CAPS2 who are these boys?"" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS16 was my cousin @PERSON1, his best friend @PERSON2 and his other friend @CAPS3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS16 was funny because my whole @CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled""@CAPS4"" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like ""@CAPS5 great she is out here"".Gameplay focuses on an open world environment where the player can choose missions to progress an overall story, as well as engaging in side activities, albeit in a more linear manner..In 1935 the district opened Clara Hearne School to serve the needs of its growing elementary aged population..A second remix by Joe Bermudez remains unreleased..The majority of the tracks on it are named after bands who influenced Nisennenmondai's music..This protein is localized at the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons and associated with potassium channels..The conference provides a forum for in depth discussion of contemporary social issues..It has a single tubular leaf and up to twenty five well-spaced, greenish-brown flowers..He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2015, representing the riding of Winnipeg Center for the New Democratic Party..This department is led by the President..The nearby Spring Creek School is on the National Register of Historic Places.. And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON2 knew why i was doing @CAPS16 but @CAPS3 and @PERSON1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them ""@CAPS7"" and that irritated them so @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you"", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS16 so i told him ""@CAPS9 ahead"" @PERSON1 started to @CAPS9 but then @PERSON2 grabbed him,@CAPS10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS11 the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME1 and @PERSON1@NUM1 and @CAPS3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS11 @PERSON2 and @CAPS3 screaming at @PERSON1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE1 old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME1 they were not home @CAPS14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS15 and @LOCATION3, @CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS17, @CAPS18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS16 kind of sucked but @CAPS16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS16 was not fun at all but my @CAPS17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS16 was so fun being at @LOCATION1 we have made @CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS9 this @DATE1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE1 and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!"
" A while back my mom had decided to send me to @DATE3 camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, @CAPS1 I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly @CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of @CAPS2. Playing @CAPS2 at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing @CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play @CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE1 we played the silly little game of @CAPS2, and just giggled and laughed. @DATE2 came along the second @DATE1 of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing @CAPS2. We played it so much the first @DATE1 that we just called it ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2"" instead of @CAPS2. Like other things we got tired of @CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE1 was so boring so we played @CAPS2 again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the @DATE1 all of us really became friends.It would also be the first album produced solely by Bootsy Collins, with the exception of the track ""Shine-O-Myte (Rag Popping)"" which was produced (as well as written) by Bootsy Collins and George Clinton..Patient navigators are also called ""insurance navigators"" or ""in-person assisters"" who have defined roles under the ACA..Sabana de la Mar National Airport is located in Sabana de la Mar, Hato Mayor, northeast Dominican Republic, and is only used for emergency landings and private flights..On 23 September 2007 Dave broke his own record by 18 m setting a new world record of 244 m in a time of 4:02..Mara Thyutlia Py literally means Mara Young Organization/Association..Invasion of the Scream Queens is a 1992 documentary film by American filmmaker Donald Farmer..It is a poorly known and little studied species, although concern over its status and that of the closely related marbled murrelet has led to a recent increase in research..Amy Spencer (born 19 September 1985) is a retired English sprinter..Lottinghen is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France..In the Congo during the first rotation, 2 Jat, 3/1 Gorkhas, and 1st Battalion the Dogra Regiment formed the first set of infantry battalions, and 2/5 GR [FF], 4th Battalion Rajputana Rifles, and 4th Battalion, the Madras Regiment, the second contingent, from 1962-63..  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the @DATE1. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all @DATE1 missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @DATE4 the @DATE1 of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the @DATE1 @DATE1 of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When @DATE1 time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost @TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, @CAPS1 we where leaving in the @TIME2. There was one @DATE1 thing we had to do, and it was one @DATE1 game of @CAPS2. We played for about in hour, @CAPS1 another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play @CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, @CAPS1 we all became friends by just playing @CAPS2 and laughing together."
"When you laugh, is @CAPS5 out of habit, or is @CAPS1 cause? What are the causes for laughing? Is @CAPS1 even such a thing as a ""cause"" for laughter? I'm sure that if you were to get a scientist's opinion, you would be given an in-depth, technical explanation for the cause of laughter; but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles? Certainly not! The true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, a senseless action, a misunderstanding? @CAPS5 can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two. @DATE1, @CAPS3 older sister @PERSON4 and I unknowingly went out on an adventure. We were headed to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to visit our very best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3, who happened to be almost completely identical to @CAPS3 sister and I in personality; @PERSON2 being like @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 being like me. Now, whenever the four of us got together, @CAPS1 was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with; all we knew was that hanging out together @CAPS8 failed to brighten up our days and put a smile on our faces. This particular day, both @PERSON3 and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and up-lifting spirits. She and I had both been going through a rough patch with some friends at our schools (oddly enough, we were both having friendship issues with someone named @PERSON1, and we didn't even go to the same school), so after some discussion between both of our sets of parents, they agreed to have @PERSON2 pick up @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 pick me up, and well all meet somewhere to take our minds off the antagonizing situations were were both suffering through. We decided to meet in @LOCATION2, at @PERSON2 and @PERSON3's house. When we pulled into their drive way, I could feel @CAPS3 body being filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped inside some kind of storage container inside of me that was too small to hold all the contents that were being held inside. Before the car engine was completely turned off, @CAPS3 seat belt was off and I was half-way out of the car door. I slammed @CAPS5 shut once @CAPS3 body had slithered its way free and ran for the door. To @CAPS3 surprise, @CAPS5 was unlocked! I pushed @CAPS5 open obnoxiously yelling, ""I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!"" @CAPS1 was a cry of laughter that filled the room. I hugged both of them in one tight squeeze, and almost as if @PERSON3 and I had our very next move planned out, we immediately began chattering about the incidents that had occured that day as we took a seat on the couch. All that could be heard was, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! I have to tell you what happened today!"" and "" I can't believe she said that!"" or ""...and she said...Sister events of Cityscape global are Cityscape Abu Dhabi, Cityscape Egypt, Cityscape Riyadh, Cityscape Jeddah, Cityscape Qatar, Latin America and Cityscape AsiaCompanies and individuals like real estate developers, cities & regional authorities, real estate investors, financial consultants, banks, fund managers, financial institutions, investment companies, pension funds, REITs, venture capitalists, insurance companies, hedge funds, fund management companies, private equity investors, asset management companies, architects, designers and urban planners exhibit their product and services during the event..Medals were given for individual high scores, and the scores of the five shooters were summed to give a team score..Mariano Esteban Uglessich ( born 6 November 1981 in Buenos Aires) is a retired Argentine football defender..This multiple meaning can lead to confusion; for example, the statement that a person ""passed matric"" or ""has their matric"" may mean either that they received a Senior Certificate (i.e. they finished high school) or specifically that they received a Senior Certificate with Matriculation Endorsement (i.e. they are eligible to enter university)..Jon Pertwee is frequently quoted as having suggested the idea of a forces comedy based on the Royal Navy, but writer Laurie Wyman and Alastair Scott Johnston both contemplated an Air Force and an Army themed sit-com before going to the BBC with The Navy Lark..Alexander Abercromby, third son of the first Baronet, was the grandfather of Sir Ralph Abercromby, whose wife was created Baroness Abercromby in his honor, of Sir Robert Abercromby, and of Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby..The Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, state governments and private parties who are sufficiently affected may all bring actions in the courts to enforce the antitrust laws..It existed until 1964 when the office of First Lord of the Admiralty was finally abolished and the functions of the Lords Commissioners were transferred to the new Admiralty Board and the tri-service Defense Council of the United Kingdom..Others of al-Janabi's family killed included her 34-year-old mother Fakhriyah Taha Muhasen, 45-year-old father Qassim Hamza Raheem, and six-year-old sister Hadeel Qassim Hamza Al-Janabi..Seaman was born in Rouleau, Saskatchewan..and then I was like...so then she says...""@CAPS5 was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama-ridden teen straight out of the movies. Things were going as they normally would have; @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 dwelling close to @PERSON3 and I in the dining room locatated at the far end of the couch where she and I sat, still completely involved in our similar freshman-year-of-high school worlds. They were completely immersed in their own conversations of old memories we'd had together. All of a sudden @PERSON2 shouts, ""@CAPS2! @PERSON3 and I baked you brownies!"" @CAPS7 off guard by his intejection, we all once again fell into laughter, although this time, making our way toward the kitchen in search of said brownies. When we arrived, @CAPS1 sat a pan of brownies on the middle counter. @PERSON3 uncovered @CAPS5 and gave us each a napkin with which a brownie sat on top. We stood together, leaning against the tile counters, enjoying our brownies and the company of one another. Suddenly, @CAPS1 was a dull moment; no one was saying anything. As if to fill the silence before a timer ran out, @PERSON2 blurted out, ""@PERSON4, do you wear a wig?"" @CAPS8 in our lives have any of us laughed as hard as we did at that moment. @PERSON3 fell to the ground, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 were leaning upon each other for support to keep from falling, and I was completely doubled over, trying desperately to keep the sip of milk I had just taken inside of @CAPS3 mouth. Minutes creeped by, and we were still laughing at the off-key remark. To this day, @PERSON4 and I remenise upon that afternoon and the laughter that was shared upon us and our very, very best friends. "
