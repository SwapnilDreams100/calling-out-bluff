"well.. like  Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy.@CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli.@CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation.By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives.well.. like Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways.uh.. like However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness.Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't.You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?""I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again.I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses.There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure.My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of.huh um Ahhh erm I was ready to face the test--once again.As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter.I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer.so.. so.. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about.Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test.On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in.so.. erm The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter.Ahhh erm For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship.Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words.um erm huh so.. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses.@CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing.Not a single story to share about laughter.By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter?um huh I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.like uh.. Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!""uh.. erm um uh.. uh.. well.. The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2.so.. uh.. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments.""Ahhh well.. @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside.The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed.Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2.In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me.Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared.",50
" ""@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1.erm hmm um well.. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day.huh huh It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework.like so.. so.. huh like uh.. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school.well.. so.. Ahhh um Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today.uh.. I mean ... By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding.Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test.I mean ... hmm As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper.I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point.@PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1.Ahhh erm I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker.like um After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home.A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker.Ahhh hmm Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain.Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself.With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper.I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me.I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost.Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese.I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove.well.. hmm Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body.huh erm Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry.My sobs sounded like a frog croaking.I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder.""@CAPS2?""@PERSON3 asked tentavely.""@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?""I just stared at her with leaking eyes.""@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself.A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling.well.. so.. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter.It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me.There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day.so.. I mean ... One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond.",50
" I once learned something very valuable in school.so.. hmm I didn't learn it in a class room, or even form a book.Ahhh erm I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room.One @MONTH1 be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall?um well.. All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon.In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background.I was in my third period class; which was leadership at the time.Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider.Kids running about the school like loose mice @MONTH1 give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was.We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the class room in order to do what needed to be done that day.Leadership directly preceded myleast favorite class of the day, @CAPS1 @CAPS2.uh.. um I simply detested that class.I had been in @CAPS1 classes ever since I was in kindergarten at @ORGANIZATION1.I was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years.It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't.I just had a strong contempt for @CAPS1 class.I mean ... so.. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and I tended to talk a lot.She was that type of person who had @CAPS10 posture and was a stickler for the rules.The the type of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon.In leadership that specific class period, the teacher was taking a particularly long time explaining what we were supposed to do that day.He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long winded.He could take the entire @NUM1 minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do.huh like That day however, we weren't doing an assignment.At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment.like uh.. Another girl from the class, @CAPS5; and myself were working on a special project.We had to retrieve something very important from my car.We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes.Ahhh so.. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot.As we were walking we passed by the office doors, the @CAPS6 hall, and the library.Just as we were about to walk by the copy room door, I saw @PERSON2.@PERSON2 was in my @CAPS1 Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him.hmm erm uh.. Ahhh I did, I then asked if he was taking @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that year.He replied with a no.I told him, ""@CAPS10 thing, because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sucks!""like um I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by the truck load in just a short while.so.. hmm Not five seconds after I had said that to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building.I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking.After I had said bye to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 hurried me out the door and she burst into laughter.um huh I was taken-aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about.so.. huh It was right then that @LOCATION1, my @CAPS1 teacher, poked her head out the door and said to me in her thick accent, ""@PERSON1, I hear you don't like my class!""I must have been as red as a tomato.well.. um I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face.The kind of look that jumps on your face when you wish you had a rewind button for your mouth.I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @CAPS5 gasping for air because she was laughing so hard.so.. like I redirected my attention to @LOCATION1, she was just standing there with an angry face covering up the laughter that was trying to break through.erm um There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say.The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river.Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room.Especially if the alligator teaches your next class.",49
" I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story.The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years.@PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most.As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment.She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease.Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid.She told me about those first days and how scared she was.Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears.Ahhh hmm He had lived longer.@PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk.His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair.um Ahhh @PERSON2 was given another miracle.He walked.With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again.@PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk.He only speaks through sign language.She also taught me how to take care of him.He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2.He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids.like uh.. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.erm so.. I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids.I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story.I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2.We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse.The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it.@PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime.We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something.Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent.like I mean ... Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having.To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience.One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart.erm um @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities.He tried for hours to make it go.um Ahhh No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move.My heart broke when I saw him start to cry.He was so frustrated.@PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead.Ahhh uh.. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face.I wanted to fix it.I mean ... huh I had to fix it.He needed to be happy.That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage.The garage was so chaotic and unorganized.hmm huh so.. well.. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike.so.. like One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell.It was the perfect thing.I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1.Ahhh well.. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy.This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents.He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk.He had lived through miracles before.He could do it again.@PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off.The anticipation was almost too much.After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn.@PERSON2 was riding a bike.well.. I mean ... huh uh.. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life.The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight.To be part of something so special was an honor.@PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day.hmm erm hmm huh He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk.I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard.We didn't want to leave each other.I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them.@PERSON2 and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE1 when we would meet again at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 where we could do it all over, and make new memories.",47
"so.. well..     Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory.It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say.When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows.Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter.Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh.One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house.We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch.well.. Ahhh As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves.like Ahhh Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes!Ahhh like This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought.In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out.From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.um I mean ... Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag.As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere!huh uh.. @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room.As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world.huh Ahhh Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up.But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered.@PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white.We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti.When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS6 and clean this up!so.. erm I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess?Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen.um like I mean ... uh.. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do.All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes.We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"".I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house.It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser.Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all.That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1!What is this??"".I mean ... um Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself.huh like I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before.so.. uh.. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs.erm hmm Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again.I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".huh uh.. like so.. From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better.uh.. hmm Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story.",47
" Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright.You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little.When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing?Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically.well.. um You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment.I mean ... um I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it.I mean ... I mean ... My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade.erm um We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time.Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family.After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have.Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying.When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me.When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors.uh.. um so.. huh Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors.We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1.like I mean ... @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive.so.. uh.. well.. hmm I mean ... huh uh.. well.. hmm well.. erm hmm Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for.We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed.Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them.Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try.Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected.As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen.After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning.So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour.I mean ... uh.. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard.so.. huh Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel.All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward.You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS2 that really sucked.""Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious.""so.. uh.. @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry.huh um I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else.If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same.",37
" Laughing at @CAPS1 bell.uh.. so.. hmm uh.. @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together.We are always laughing about something even if @CAPS7's something completely stupid or actually really funny.We laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things.erm Ahhh Also we laugh at funny things we do.@CAPS8 one thing that has always stuck to @CAPS11 head, the time at @CAPS1 bell.One day after school, me and @CAPS11 best friend @PERSON1 decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @CAPS1 bell.We ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @CAPS7.Ahhh so.. A few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @CAPS7.""@CAPS4"" I said to @LOCATION1 as i took a bite of @CAPS11 @CAPS5 five layer burrito.erm I mean ... ""@CAPS6""@CAPS7 was really hot and burned @CAPS11 mouth.I had to wait for a few minuets to eat @CAPS11 burrito.well.. um So we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives.so.. erm A couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face.The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat.hmm I mean ... Meanwhile I thought @CAPS11 burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head.Next thing i knew @CAPS11 burrito was coming out of @CAPS11 mouth and I was dieing of laughter.huh hmm @CAPS11 burrito was spit completely out of @CAPS11 mouth, and all over me an @LOCATION1.Ahhh well.. All over @CAPS11 hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table.I was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @CAPS8 to laugh.well.. um I think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @CAPS8 wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight.well.. uh.. You might think this was the end of @CAPS11 bad day, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 only gets worse.Ahhh like erm like Eating @CAPS11 burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever.@CAPS7 probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito.Meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink.So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10.huh so.. As i was returning to @CAPS11 table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line.Ahhh uh.. I almost spilled @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS8 luckily I didn't.Returning to @CAPS11 seat i was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad @CAPS11 day was, and how @CAPS7 couldn't get any worse.Then i took a drink an I started to choke on @CAPS11 @CAPS10, @CAPS7 was so bad that i spit everything out onto @LOCATION1, @CAPS10 went flying everywhere, @CAPS7 even came out of @CAPS11 noes.So i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @CAPS11 self up, caught @CAPS11 breath, and told @PERSON1 i was ready to go home.Ahhh so.. When i look back and think about the day at @CAPS1 bell with @CAPS11 best friend, I not only think about how embarrassing @CAPS7 was for me and her, @CAPS8 also that @CAPS7 was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @CAPS11 life.As i said before @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday.",37
" Laughter?What is laughter?so.. so.. well.. hmm Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up.hmm Ahhh Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid.um like My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2 , and @CAPS3.On my birthday the whole @CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world.Ahhh I mean ... well.. huh Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade.um erm Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.When @LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find.Which we always seem to miss at least one every year.Ahhh huh While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again.When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them.Then watching him try to climb down again.like I mean ... When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek.Ahhh Ahhh Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot.well.. Ahhh On the @DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow.so.. um like huh My dad and me go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so.Then on the @DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS2.erm hmm My dad sets up his house as a haunted house.Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources.When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them.Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do.Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS3!a time of gift giving and receiving.like um mostly receiving for me.We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking.erm I mean ... After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest.Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again.Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them.uh.. so.. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell.That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up.It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time.Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad ""A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1"".",37
"well.. huh The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time.Ahhh uh.. huh well.. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different.Both are active, humorous girls.You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise.@PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair.Her clear skin has a tint of olive green.Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret.um so.. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes.hmm Ahhh @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair.Each golden curl ends at her belly button.like I mean ... well.. hmm The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks.uh.. uh.. I mean ... well.. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean.You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.um I mean ... hmm Ahhh One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance.After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body.Ahhh I mean ... Two hours fly by and the girls got it.They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1.uh.. huh They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers.After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped.@ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording.hmm Ahhh Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps.Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other.It was silent, except for the music playing.erm uh.. huh I mean ... Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter.Ahhh so.. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other.All of this happened with me recording.After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends.It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together.Without them I would not know what laughter is.",37
"uh.. I mean ... I mean ... so.. hmm huh                              ""Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh?Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long.There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day.Some of my favorite movies are funny.um huh I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job.hmm well.. I mean ... erm hmm well.. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday.Are you going to go in there boring and moditone?hmm huh um well.. No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.Laughter can also be abused.It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny.well.. huh well.. I mean ... Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you.Ahhh well.. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game.Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.A few hours after my @CAPS4 died.My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us.uh.. well.. I mean ... I mean ... I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks.um hmm I mean ... so.. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain.huh uh.. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud.It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night.I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life.",37
"                   The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR.I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5.We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs.We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment.His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage.huh hmm He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land.He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up.Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made.I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands.so.. Ahhh Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in.I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was.But there was still stuff to do.like um My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in.The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg.I mean ... hmm They just finished the pull @CAPS3.I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them.Ahhh like When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond.They were soaked in sweat.hmm erm Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3.When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet.Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor.We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess.huh so.. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints.Ahhh so.. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble.So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint.I mean ... Ahhh So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project.Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried.to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor.like erm As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints.well.. um Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints.As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything.Ahhh uh.. erm so.. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them.As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion.They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot.My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?""I mean ... I mean ... ""@CAPS6"" i replied with a scared face.Ahhh I mean ... I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?""I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS6"".erm so.. erm uh.. He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"".Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner.",37
