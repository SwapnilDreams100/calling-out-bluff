"  A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON2 who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure. I started &lt;@CAPS5 knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS1 sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom&gt;. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS5 @CAPS5&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.             FIN.We had a life, we had a love,   But you don't know what you've got 'til you lose it   Well that was then and this is now   And I want you back   How many times do I have to say I'm sorry      How

could never sing   'Cause love isn't for me and you   If love was an Oscar, you and I could never win   'Cause we could never act out our parts   If love is the bible, then we are lost in sin   Cause it's not in our hearts      So why don't you go your way   And I'll go mine   Live your life   And I'll live mine   Baby you'll do well   And I'll be fine   'Cause we're better off separated      If love was a fire, then we have lost the spark   Love never felt so cold   If love was the light, then we're lost in the dark   Left with no one to hold   If love was a sport, we're not on the same team   You and i are destined to lose   If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream   'Cause love isn't for me and you      Why don't you go your way   And I'll go mine   Live your life   And I'll live mine   Baby you'll do well   And I'll be fine   'Cause we're better off separated      Girl I know we had some good times   It's sad but now, we gotta say goodbye   Girl you know I love you, I can't deny   Can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I   I know it hurts, so much but it's best for us   Somewhere along this winding road we lost the trust   So I'll walk away, so you don't have to see me cry   It's killing me so, why don't you go      Why don't you go your way (oh)   And I'll go mine (baby)   Live your life (oh)   And I'll live mine (I'll live mine)   Baby you'll do well (I'll be fine)   And I'll be fine   'Cause we're better off, so much better off      Go your way (Go your way)   And I'll go mine (I'll go mine)   Live your life (Your life)   I'll live mine   You'll do well (ohh hoo)   And I'll be fine      'Cause we're better off, so much better off   So much better off   Separated      I'm sorry we didn't make it.This is a night to remember   A sweet celebration of love   It's a holiday of dreams   In warm reds and greens   And a star that keeps shining above   Christmas Eve      Children, Santa, mistletoe and moonlight..How different it could   Be from the music of the Temples!.Well all you want to do is sit around and pout   And now I've got enough so I'm gettin' out   I'm leavin' now I'm leavin' now   I'm a long gone daddy I don't need you

move at a slower pace   Nobody's in the rat race   And these days that's a special way of life      [Chorus]   Down home, where they know you by name   And treat you like family   Down home, a man's good word and hand shake   Are all you need   Folks know if they're falling on hard times   They can fall back on   Those of us raised up down home      In the corner of the hardware store   Gathered 'round a checkerboard   Old men telling lies and crowning kings   Kids driving 'round the old town square   Tops rolled down in the cool night air   Go and see what's shaking at the Dairy Queen      [Chorus]      When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place   But now I want to see my children raised down home, down home      Folks know if they're falling on hard times   They can fall back on   Those of us raised up...      [Chorus].Television dreams of tomorrow..I will teach him to rejoice, and life a thankful praising voice,   And to be like him who bore the nails and crown of thorns..Oh, I can't! ).They would rather see you all alone..You told me about yourself,   How you once lived with someone else   The way of life that you had tried   The way they hurt you deep inside   That's the only thing about it   I can't find anyone to doubt it   That's the only thing about it   I can't find anyone to doubt it   Who do you think you're talking to?.You put me out!.What's right my love?.They possess you, bless you, sunshine, now you can never let them down, I say sunshine..Someone said as we shook hands   She was just Miss Jones to me   And then I said ""Miss Jones,      You're a girl who understands,   I'm a man who must be free."".The fine purple   The purest gold   The red of the Sacred Heart   The gray of a ghost   The ""L"" of the lips are open   The ""O"" of the host   The ""V"" of the velvet   The

beat em' beat em' beat em' beat em'   All pathetic flag waving ignorant hicks and we'll   Eat em' eat em' eat em' eat em' eat em' eat em'      Come join the cause, come join the cause!.I know.You and I we shared enough together   Each other was all we'd ever need   I thought that you would stay with me forever   But I took for granted the love you gave to me   But I'll keep on trying, till the end   Baby I need you back with me   I need you back,      [Chorus]      And girl I'm going out of my mind   I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do   Please say its just a matter of time,   Until I feel your touch,   Until you let me come back to you      I think about you girl every time at night   I'm in love, and it feels so right   I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain   I was just caught up in the lying game   But now those days are over, I've changed my ways   Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days   Until you let me come back,   Until you let me start   To find a new way to get back into your heart..To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication   The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,   And the circling is worth it..I feel the warmth of her hand in mine..You can roll that stone   To the top of the hill   Drag your ball and chain   Behind you      You can carry that weight   With an iron will   Or let the pain remain   Behind you      Chip away the stone   (Sisyphus)   Chip away the stone   Make the burden lighter   If you must roll that rock alone      You can drive those wheels   To the end of the road   You will still find the past right   Behind you      The weight of the load   Try to put the sins of the past night   Behind you      Carve away the stone   (Sisyhpus)   Carve away the stone   Make a graven image   With some features of your own      You call roll the stone   To the top of the hill   You can carry that weight   With an iron will   You can drive those wheels   To the end of the road   You can try to deny   The weight of the load      Roll away the stone   (Sisyhpus)   Roll away the stone   If you could just move yours   I could get working on my own.Let the boy become a man..[Chorus].The fastest, highest,   Steepest, and tallest coaster-ride ever to exist on this or any other planet!.My enemy you were, my an' I was young..We made Michael Jackson one rich mother..I say   Black cars look better in the shade   Black cars look better in the shade.On the edge   Windowsill   Ponders his maker   Ponders his will   To the street below   He just ain't nothin'   But he's

" I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness..Best friend   (are..Ooh, you make him feel so young,   But his wife is still the number one..Oh let me go, let me go, let me go lover   Let me be set me free from your spell   You made me weak cut me deep I can't sleep lover   I was cursed from the first day I fell   Oh you don't want me but you want me to go on wanting you   How I pray that you will say that we're through   Oh turn me loose, what's the use   Let me go lover, let me go, let me go, let me go      Oh you don't want me but you want me to go on wanting you   How I pray that you will say that we're through   Oh turn me loose, what's the use   Let me go lover, let me go, let me go, let me go      Oh let me go, let me go, let me go lover   Let me be set me free from your spell   You made me weak cut me deep I can't sleep lover   I was cursed from the first day I fell   Oh you don't want me but you want me to go on wanting you   How I pray that you will say that we're through   Oh turn me loose, what's the use   Let me go lover, let me go, let me go, let me go.Bobby wants a 10-speed, an English racer   Jenny wants that fuzzy teddy-bear   Now your asking me   What I'd like from Santa, for Christmas this year   There's a lot of things, girl you could buy for me   But they wouldn't mean as much, as you standing by that tree      Just put a ribbon in your hair, darlin'   You'll be the best gift anywhere   Christmas Mornin'   There's no worldly treasure   Id like any better, than you standin' there   Just put a ribbon in your hair      (Mmmm...)

taking you to bed   Her legs wrapped round your head   You're losing her to some crazy kind of motion   You keep coming up for air   You look around and stare   Find you're swimming into completely different oceans   You're wondering if she's thinking about some other man   She says, ""C'mon, baby, you know you are my loverman""   You're going nuts you don't know exactly what to say   She says, ""Don't worry, baby, this is just my little way      Of leaving you""   Oh, man, she's leaving you      Guitar solo!.I was blinded by your love   I was blinded by your love   I couldn't talk to you last night   Friends and strangers side by side   I was blinded by your love      Oh God knows   We're walking through a fire   Sound of breaking hearts around   Oh you know, we're burning in desire   City of the lost and found   In a world of broken dreams   We will build a better life   You're my Venus in blue jeans   Only the strong survive   So come on baby, come on baby      Dreams are made   Made of deep emotion   Love will feed a brand new world   Baby, you need the shadows and devotion   Living in a better world   There's a heavy weather girl   The clouds disappear   The masquerade of loneliness   Is drowning too much tears   Come on baby, come on baby.(ooh baby)      [Bridge]      [Chorus]      If you really want it good [Repeat: x11].Be my reminder here that I am not alone in   This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal   All this pain is an illusion..Well, just for one last time   I'll sing my song just like I did before   Maybe you'll sing along   Do you still recall that moonlight song?.And then a few days later, on an old city road,   We were drowning in laughter, and we had women to hold,   And this went on quite a long time, my father gave me a lot,   But when my pockets were empty, my friends all left me to rot."
" People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes a you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"".  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, ""@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""@CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time"". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh. That's @CAPS2 makes our family relationship stick together, and other familys also.I finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship..In the morning   Radio jingles   Drive me mental   Turning

"               ""Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but @CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping @CAPS2 full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh @CAPS2 off with time and start new. @CAPS5 helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried @CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever @CAPS5 would joke around with me I would take @CAPS2 all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought @CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that @CAPS2 was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. @CAPS5 said, ""@PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. @CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, ""@PERSON1? Are you alright, @CAPS2's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" @CAPS5 exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes @CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, @CAPS5 looked worried. @CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that @CAPS5 so desperately wanted to have with me. @CAPS5 told me about how they would @CAPS3 together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then @CAPS3. ""@CAPS3? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned.  @CAPS5 replied, "" @CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" @CAPS5 helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can @CAPS3 off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" .Good morning   Wake up      Wake up with purpose and polite efficiency   Stuff vitamin pills

time with you   Don't let this moment die   I get a feeling when I'm with you   None of the rules apply   But I know for certain   Goodbye is a crime   So love if you need me   Suspend me in time      Wasted the time away   Holding your love at bay   Now i can't last a day without you   Your smile is a thrill to see   Your eyes hold me tenderly   They'll shine in my memory forever.You've been seeing things,   In darkness, not in learning,   Hoping that the truth will pass..And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south,   Hide your head in the sand,   Just another sad old man,   All alone and dying of cancer..I forgive you, I forgive me   Now when do I start to feel again   I forgive you, I forgive me   Now when do I start to feel again      'Cause the lights are on   But I'm never home   But I'll be back with a brand new attitude   'Cause I forgive you      [Chorus]   I forgive you   We were just a couple of kids   Trying to figure out how to live   Doing it our way   No shame, no blame   'Cause the damage is done   And I forgive you   I forgive you   We were busy living the dream   Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us   No shame, no blame   'Cause the damage is done   And I forgive you      I forgive you, I forgive me   Now do I start to feel again   If I hate you, what does that do   So I breathe in and I count to 10      'Cause the lights are on   And I'm coming home   Yes I am back   With a new heart in my hand   'Cause I forgive you      [Chorus]      I forgive you   For every time that I cried   Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me   That's alright, yeah I forgive you      I forgive you   We were just a couple of kids   Trying to figure out how to live   Doing it our way   No shame, no blame   'Cause the damage is done   And I forgive you      [Chorus]"
" Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case she is full of joy, and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her all that takes place is laughter, and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and when ever you put the shapes into the right slots it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh, and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON1, my nephew, and @CAPS2 brother. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughs harder then ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see laughter is happy, and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew is just one example. What makes you laugh and smile?.Closer than my thoughts   Closer than a kiss   How can it be more   Intimate than this?.I wanna live with a fearless heart   Courage that's coming from trust in God   It's constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark, yeah   I wanna live with a fearless heart   Courage that's coming from trust in God   It's constantly guiding me though the road is dark   I wanna live, wanna live with a fearless heart   With a fearless heart, with a fearless heart   With a fearless heart.Monogram: It's a contraction..Thunder and rain   Well the cynical flame will it heat, stick and blister?.Can't it wait until tomorrow?.The demons   The fear that will confine you   The fire that will burn   Your innocence away..Leaving me here   Forever goodbye..So partly thanks to Welsh weather,   I was crowned, think I'm gunna dance now!.Heartache is at my door step, won't leave me alone..down (This is) to Mean Street   They're dancin' now, look!.Hell or hallelujah!.You need a path to cross   Into a place where everyone you see   Has had a time to try to Play!.Do you want me back again?.Taking our chances with raw energy..Really thought that I could live without you   Really thought that I could make it on my own   Sent you away yeah I said I didn't need you   I let you go I let you go I let you go   Now I'm so lost without you   Now you're not here and now I know      Lonely is the night when I'm not with you   Lonely is the night ain't no light shining through   Till you're in my arms till you're here by my side   Lonely am I      Never thought that I that I would need you   Never thought that I that I'd be missing you   Gotta get you back   I just got to find a way now   To let you know to let you know to let you know   That I'm so lost without you   And now this world it just ain't right      Lonely is the night when I'm not with you   Lonely is the night ain't no light shining through   Till you're in my arms till you're here by my side   Lonely am I      I can make it through the day   I can fake it okay   I just smile and pretend   And I tell myself I'll be alright      But lonely is the night   Lonely is the night.And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,   But it only took one night to bring it down,   When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground..It's a rich man's game   No matter what they call it   And you spend your life   Putting money in his wallet      9 to 5.Stone shaker is looking fine   She's a heart-breaker every time   She never seems to realize   That someday she'll be crying too..So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me   So deep that I didn't even scream fuck me      I'll be just fine   Pretending I'm not   I'm far from lonely   And it's all that I've got      I'll be just fine   Pretending I'm not   I'm far from lonely   And it's all that I've got      And it's all that I've got   Yeah, it's all that I've got.I said, Lord, take me downtown,   I'm just lookin' for some tush..Don't you fuckin' lie..Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you..Fabolous and Missy, Sickalicious right..Think again!!.And yesterday   There was nothing in my life worth living for..And that's when I met you..While I sink to the bottom..take control of your own fate..It's only right that you should know-   if he asks me, I will not lie for you, mama, I won't lie for you..Our God says   ""this is the way!"".Sometimes you make me feel like I got a heartful of toys   Oh baby boys will be boys..Calm down   Deep breaths   And get yourself dressed instead   Of running around   And pulling all your threads saying   Breaking yourself up      If it's a broken part, replace it   But, if it's a broken arm then brace it   If it's a broken heart then face it      And hold your own   Know your name   And go your own way      And hold your own   Know your name   And go your own way      And everything will be fine   Everything will be fine   Hmm      Hang on   Help is on the way   Stay strong   I'm doing everything      And hold your own   Know your name   And go your own way      And hold your own   Know your name   And go your own way      And everything, everything will be fine   Everything      Are the details in the fabric   Are the things that make you panic   Are your thoughts results of static cling?.Keep smiling through   Just like you always do,   'Til the blue skies   Drive the dark clouds far away   So will you please say""Hello""   To the folks that I know..My guy's back in town   You can mess around 'til the midnight hour   To see what he's puttin' down   So, come on, oh baby, come on   A-come on, I love you daddy all night long      A-turn your lamp down low   A-turn your lamp down low   A-turn your lamp down low   I love you daddy all night long   Turn that thing down, baby   I love you daddy all night long"
" In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter..Bodies, bodies, bodies!.It was just too soon..So now it's up to you,   For both of us..Where will it end?.I'm in here, I'm calling out but you can't hear,   Can anybody help?.This the prince..Try to... never say goodbye      I wish I knew   How to tell you   How to tell me why.Now I know a girl who was putting on weight,   In a spot where it just shouldnt be   So I said to Nellie, ""Now you rub your ankle, with Auntie Maggies Remedy."".Wow!.Although, we're on our way from the show,   And you don't like to get off the track..Are you feeling naughty?.But I sewed your lips, Johnny,   And that was that..So I laugh in your face..I ain't no fuckin' G, I'm a cannibal   I ain't tryin' to shoot you,   I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you   Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass   And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress   Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!).You would have laughed if you'd have only seen me   Yes, I guess, I was a funny sight to see   Standing there on the street   With my heart at my feet   Funny but I'm not laughing..[Chorus]      [Outro: kung fu sample]   You've learned how to kill   Every moved you've learned is trained to that end   Yet, we wish to preserve life   The first thing to learn, is that difference   Then you can start training with us, from the beginning.Brother, it don't matter   Sister, don't worry   Say what you like   I'll do what you want me to do   You're a vampire   I'm a vampire too      Sun in the kitchen   Boy, you're still sleeping   When you get hungry   I'll do what you want me to do   You're a vampire   I'm a vampire too      Night in the city   New Orleans pretty   Do what you want   And then can I do it to you?.If you runnin from love   You love her like that   You runnin' from nuns   She running right back   Because it's      [Hook:]      [Verse 2:]   And I'm on a road   And I'm backin?.Looking back at days of four instead of two..You were there -

" Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS3 awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS3 embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE2, we go secret @LOCATION1 shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS3 going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""@CAPS2 great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said "" @CAPS3 you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS3 all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it..In the desert with no love   No cactus's, just dust   And you swept me from above      My love      So I just wanna say   Thank you for this day   'Cause it is so good   Good      Honey, you got me feelin' brand new   You got me feelin' brand new   Like the tag's still on me   Got the tags still on me   Jumpin' 'round in your bag   Jumpin' 'round in your bag   So good morning, ooh girl   You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)   You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)   Like the tag's still on me   Got the tags still on me      My love, ooo   My love      Life to me is easy   People make it complicated   When love is the tool   No reason we can't make it      Come on, let's go, be brave   Feel somethin' at the [?].I'm coming to get you, oh yeah..All of a sudden she was on my mind   I wasn't ready for her kind   And she was taking her time..The way that I feel   is so heavenly, too good to be real..Everybody in the whole cell block   Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock..Bridge:   I'm on in the middle...

" Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM1 grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS2 and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?.You needn't try, know the whole story..Imagine a man   Where it all began   A scientist pacing the floor   In each nation, always eager to explore   To build the best big stick   To turn the winning trick   But this was something more....Look mama   I love you   But you gotta let me live my life..""hurry boys now"", said whack   ""or before we're there we're all be back   Carry him if you can""   The craic was ninety in the isle of man..Verse 1:      There was this guy,   A little smaller,   He was great,   And I was taller..I just can't seem to get enough   When I'm running good, you know,   I don't slow down, even the times   When I know I should go slow      I know this won't ever be easy,   I don't give up, so won't you get me      Give me some more,   I need it right now, get it now,   Give me some more,   I need it one more time      Give me some more,   I want it right now, get it now,   Give me some more,   I want it one more time      You know I live for thunder,   This is where I'm meant to be,   And when I'm six feet under,   Will you still be there for me?.I was a man with a world in his hand but I dropped it   A world of dreams a world of plans but I dropped it   It didn't lay there very long I turned around and it was gone   He took my girl he put my world right in his pocket      All she wanted was my love and understanding   I didn't care enough I wasn't bear enough and she got lonely      I was a man with a world in his hand but I dropped it   A world of dreams a world of plans but I dropped it   And good things don't just lay around neglected on the ground   He took my girl he put my world right in his pocket   He took my girl he put my world right in his pocket.All right, now look, look, we've...we've seen a lot of things happened in the city,   and everything's turned around..He'll keep you in a jar,   Then you'll think you're happy....[Chorus:]   I watch you sleeping little angel face   And on behalf of the human race   Welcome to this crazy place      I watch you sleeping innocent and free   I don't know what your dreams may be   You don't know what you mean to me      You have never heard thunder   You have never seen the rain   But you can still feel the wonder   You can still feel the pain      And sometimes you look at me   So wise and so sure   I could easily believe you have been here before      [Chorus]      I won't be here forever   But as long as I'm around   I promise you I will never let you down   To help make a world you can feel worthy of   I will teach you to fly on the wings of my love      I watch you sleeping brave and unaware   You don't know yet so you don't care   I want you to know it's hard out there      [Chorus]      I watch you sleeping (x6).It's true, you got me wrapped around your finger   Ah honey, it seems that's where I belong   You know how to hold me, thrill me and control me   Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on   Ah honey, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on      My heart is like a yo-yo string   I'm tied to you, I'm tied to you right or wrong   My love keeps on growing   Cause your love keeps right on showing   Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on   Oh baby, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on      A love as true as mine will make you do most anything   Like hiding tears and heartaches   And dreaming all those silly dreams   Ah honey, you got me, you got me where you want me   And you keep me stringing along      Just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on   Ah baby, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on   Ah honey, just enough, just enough to keep me hangin' on   Oh tell me why, just enough.Step by step we go, far away from trouble   How I wish you could see what you never see      And under us the river subsides for you   Whenever you cry look above, the angels will fly for you   'Cause you're the one   You can call on me for all of the dark you fear   And I am here, to start a new before you too comes undone..You can't steal his pennies   No!.Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'   Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'   While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?.(speech:)   Ok here we go, for this   We got a b-side to make, ladies and gentlemen,   We haven't got much time now so we better get   Right on with it      I don't care anymore   And Ill kick down anybodys door   To hold you in my arms once more   Id go anywhere   Yknow I don't care      If your man should get uptight   cause weve been alone for most of the night   Now realize its our right   To get back up them stairs   Yknow I don't care      Theres a line I can draw   That often leaves me wanting more   But its not so often that I feel so sure   Nothing I can do   To stop me falling more in love with you      It can't be so bad   What you want that you do not have   Its got you too upset now   I don't think its unfair   Yknow I don't care   Anymore   And Ill kick down anybodys door   To hold you in my arms once more   Id go anywhere   Yknow I      (very nice, tony).[Chorus]   So cry on my shoulder and let's both get over the bad..life is not the life for me   Stupid little girls And egotistic boys   O.C..Lord, times were good there..'Cause I got my best dress on   Can I be your fantasy?.I wanna feel your love..You will see, the greed will be to blame   Greedy for the fame, tv or a name   Media, the game, to me your all the same   You're guilty..A friendly breeze gave us a start   To a paradise of our own..Why?.Here's a part of me they have not sold..Don't feel guilty, master writing      Somebody said that they're not much like I am   I know I can   Make enough of the words for you to follow along   I sink and then some      Slippery pessimist hypocrite master   Conservative communist apocalyptic bastard   Thank you dear God for putting me on this earth   I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst      Hold me down in restitution   Living out your date with fusion   Is the whole fleece shun in master?.You   Who made the whole world with your hand   Walked along this land   Humbled as a man   You came down   and you changing the water to wine   Gave your greatest sign   By changing lives like mine   How did You know   I'd eventually go   And take you for the Lord of my life?.My dearest,   I'm nearest than I've ever been before   To have you calling me 'dearest' once more..Ten thousand women all dressed in white,   Ten thousand women all dressed in white,   Standin' at my window wishing me goodnight..I want to show You   That my love for You is real   You save me, forgiven me   This hole inside my heart You filled   You take me, shape me   I wanna grow up just

"Many @CAPS1 to laughter People always say that laughing can have many benefits. The truth, I believe, is that laughter is not always the best thing. Laughing can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles,happiness, and memories. Although, there is one memory of laughter that does not prove that to be true. ""@CAPS2, I really don't wanna be here. I don't know that I can stay here and tell him this,"" I pleaded to @CAPS11 mother to @CAPS6 me go back home. ""@CAPS3 need to do this honey. @CAPS8's for the best."" @CAPS4 that point I had always though @CAPS11 mother knew best. Now, I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back tears, waiting for @CAPS11 father to get back to his house. I knew he was at the bar, and silently thanked him that I had time to think.  I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way there. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at @CAPS11 drunk father and @CAPS11 heart dropped. I burst out in tears while @CAPS11 mother held me in her arms. ""@CAPS5...@CAPS8's alright,"" she soothed. @CAPS11 father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man @CAPS11 mother had once married anymore. He had became a monster.  I couldn't stand @CAPS8 anymore. I walked into the room where @CAPS11 mother waited with worry in her eyes. ""@CAPS6's go home,"" I said. On the way home I sobbed until @CAPS11 shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on @CAPS11 face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS11 @CAPS9 how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. ""@CAPS7. Hey."" @CAPS8 made me upset that @CAPS11 father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk.  ""@CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel as though @CAPS3 are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know @CAPS10 addicted and there are risks with stopping but @CAPS3're also endangering @CAPS10 health!"" I basically screamed at him. I poured out @CAPS11 heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @CAPS11 father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. ""@CAPS10 mother told @CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @CAPS8. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 doesn't know what she's talking about."" @CAPS11 jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious. Anger boiled in me.  ""@CAPS3 don't even know me! @CAPS3 don't even care about me!"" I screamed then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked straight at @CAPS11 mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave.  This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is almost always a great thing, I started to cry because, just once, laughing didn't mean happiness. @CAPS8 meant tears..In his black leather hunting outfit with shotgun guitar with spikes coming out of it, Ozzie Fudd the Rabbit Slayer!.Vagabonds don't fall in love   They just wheel and they deal   So if I turn a funny colour when you kiss me   I can't help the way that I feel      Hooligans don't fall in love   They just break up others lives   So when I come to you on bended knee   Don't forget my twenty other wives      So why?.And I know because of KRS-ONE..So tell me, what can I do   That you couldn't see through   From the very start?.message sent yesterday at 10:41 pm..Out of all the women in the world,   He belongs to only you..Here I go again   Hanging on to the bitter end   All alone   Nothing left to lose   Don't want to face tomorrow   I can't sleep tonight   Blame it on the weather   Till I get over you..I feel your touch upon my skin..Sis boom buzz   Sis boom buzz   You heard me!.No, don't give me something, Lord, that you might take away   To have you then lose you it wouldn't be smart on my part   Don't open the door to heaven, honey, if I can't come in   And don't touch me if you don't love me, sweetheart..I am the warrior   I serve the death machine   Losers or conquerors   All flash past on my silver screen      Death is no easy answer   For those who wish to know   Ask those who have been before you   What fate the future holds      It ain't pretty      I am a messenger   The message here, you must know   I am the warrior   I deliver the fatal blow      So fate will have to wait   Till time can heal the scar   My heart is ruled by Venus   And my head by Mars.Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown..(This is a pity).When will it ever end?.[Chorus]      You're the star now, welcome to the big league   They all want a pic, they all wanna see, see, see   What you're made of, what you're gonna do   Is life gonna get the best of you?.Oh, I would be stronger   I would not stay one minute longer   I would be stronger than that      Oh, I would be stronger   I would not wait one minute longer   I would be stronger than that.I know you feel the weight of the world   Heavy on your shoulders   Let my love take you down another road   And lighten up the load   From here on.All      With all the favors that he's done   J.

"                          Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5, we've got something to tell @CAPS3."" I knew @CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that @CAPS8 they went into the other room, @CAPS6 wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce @CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells @CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @CAPS3 could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS9 was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet @CAPS11 become one, @CAPS6 had turned red @CAPS11 irritated. @CAPS6 killed me inside to see her crying, @CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love @CAPS11 that @CAPS6 all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment @CAPS11 anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around @CAPS9 was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,""@CAPS6's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father @CAPS11 I."" @CAPS7 did they think those statements made @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION1. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. @CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. @CAPS6 was broken @CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just @CAPS8 @CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I @CAPS1 never forget. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time @CAPS8 mom @CAPS11 I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS11 familiar. @CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives @CAPS11 mine.  I began to laugh, @CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,""@CAPS9's wrong, @CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That @CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, @CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, @CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS1 be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If @CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4..Concentration camps   For everyone I think's a jerk   That'll be most everyone   And they'll do all the work   Dissidents are put to death   Nightly on the tube   Executions will continue   Until morale improves..Oh, God make it bleed..Happy joyous Hanukah   Eight are the candles you should light   For a Happy joyous Hanukah      [Chorus]      One for Moses on the Mount   Happy joyous Hanukah   Two for the mother and father love   Happy Joyous Hanukah      [Chorus]      Three for the Books that Ezra taught   Happy joyous Hanukah   Four's for the Hebrew children   Happy joyous Hanukah      [Chorus]      Five for the Brothers Maccabee   Happy joyous Hanukah   Six for the tricks the King did play   Happy Joyous Hanukah      [Chorus]      Seven for the sons of Hannah that died   Not so happy Hanukah   Eight for the newbuilt alter place   Happy joyous Hanukah      [Chorus]      Nine is the light of God that shines   Happy joyous Hanukah   Around this whole wide world tonight   Happy joyous Hanukah      [Chorus]      Nine is for God's light that shines   Eight for the newbuilt alter place   Seven for the sons of Hannah that died   Six for kings and the tricks they tried   Five for the brothers Maccabee   Four for the Hebrew children   Three for the Books that Ezra taught   Two for the father and mother love   One for Moses on the Mount      Eight are the night of Hanukah   Happy joyous Hanukah   Eight are the days and eight are the nights   Happy joyous Hanukah      Happy joyous Hanukah!.To your stations   Man the ramparts   The barricades      We need new heroes urgently   We need a few good honest men   Calling all honest men   Calling all honest men      Call to him   He lives next door   Across the street   On the upper floor   It's our only hope we need him now      Send the S.

"When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1.We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so I jumped off the four-wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS1. It was by far the biggest @CAPS2 head that we have ever seen.  While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON1 told me to get the net he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole.At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON1 was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole.   Once @PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole.  The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @PERSON1 and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON2 was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON2 jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally i don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had..You got to weep   You got to wail   You got to drag yourself on hands and knees bleeding   Another mile along the trail   You got to laugh in the face of the devil   When he's hanging on to your shirt tail   You got to hold down the lid of the coffin   And hammer in the last nail      My baby's gone so far away   She's never coming back to me      You got to live   You got to learn   How to find your way to the end of the night   When there's nowhere left to turn   How to keep the last embers of the fire alight   When there's nothing left to burn   How to say goodbye to the ashes that fly   From the cheap metal urn      My baby's gone so far away   She's never coming back to me      She said go to sleep   You got to save   Your anger and rage for the living   'Cause they're no damn good in the grave   And don't waste your time in forgiving   The ones who just don't know how to behave   There's heaven and hell in the world that you live in   But I'm in a different place      My baby's gone so far away   She's never coming back to me.The flavor of life   Wasurekakete ita hito no kaori wo

"                 A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  I once heard ""laughter is the best medicine."" I believe that is true. I could laugh all day long, finding anything @CAPS9 everything funny in @CAPS3 world. Laughter is important to me, without it, life would be boring. Sometimes Laughter is good @CAPS9 comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS9 mean. I like to avoid the cruel @CAPS9 mean laughter, @CAPS9 just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing @CAPS9 smiling, it makes me want to know @CAPS10 they're laughing about, so I can laugh too.  Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends, @CAPS9 my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS9 I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy @CAPS9 always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @CAPS9 soon the party was over, but, my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in @CAPS9 wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. ""@CAPS3 is so good!"" my cousin @PERSON1 said. ""I know that's why I had my mom make it"" "" @CAPS4 you wanna hear a joke?"" ""@CAPS5."" @PERSON1 said. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS7 once was a kid named butt itches, he was really sick @CAPS9 one day died, his mom cried to the doctor,""@CAPS8 my poor butt itches!"" ""@CAPS9 @CAPS12, @CAPS4 you wanna know @CAPS10 the doctor said?"" ""@CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 @PERSON1. ""@CAPS12 itch it!"" @PERSON1 had just took a drink of punch when I said @CAPS3. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, it got all over me. Usually when someone spits, or spills something on you, you get mad. I started cracking up laughing, @CAPS9 so did she. ""@CAPS8 my gosh! That's so gross."" ""@NUM1 @CAPS9 I could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny, it was the punch all over me @CAPS9 the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us wondering @CAPS10 in the world had happened.  You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your @CAPS2, would make you mad. @CAPS3 is why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case laughter was the shortest distance between @PERSON1 @CAPS9 I. It would have to be short for her to get that much punch on me. Laughter made @CAPS3 @CAPS2 extra special, because I will never forget my twelfth @CAPS2..Don't have to take it so hard!.Creeping like a hungry cat   Seen it before   I know it can mean that      The

sang with my guitar,   But the studio of course,   owned my saddle and my horse,   But that six-gun on the wall belongs to me,   Oh god I can't live a memory..Last night I had too much to drink   Sitting in a club with so many fools   Playing to rules   Trying to impress but feeling rather empty   I had another drink   Drink, a, drink, a, drink, a, drink      What a way to spend that evening   They all turn up with their friends   Playing the game   But in the scene I should have been   Far away   Away, away, away, away, away   Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before   I open the door to an empty room   Then I forget      The telephone rings and someone speaks   She would very much like to go out to a show   So what can I do, I can't think what to say   She sees through anyway   Away, away, away, away, away      Out of the front door I go   Traffic's moving rather slow   Arriving late, there she waits   Looking very angry, as cross as she can be   Be, a, be, a, be, a, be, a, be   Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before   I open the door to an empty room   Then I forget.Well sometimes the sun shines on   Other people's houses and not mine..That's when things got out of control   She didn't want to, he had his way   She said, ""Let's go""   He said, ""No way!"".How strange!"
" Laughter is the so called ""best medicine"". I do not believe that to be true, however my nephew @MONTH1 have other thoughts. My nephew was ""sick"" for every school day for two weeks. ""@CAPS1 just doesn't like school"", I would tell his grandma. The thought of school being no fun and not liking it changed drastically for my nephew.  We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they get a party, lucky for @CAPS2 they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing it's ugly face that morning as @CAPS1 fought every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door @PERSON1 did something uncharacteristic, to him and five year old's all over the @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags, they went all out for the first one of the year. The aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire. Above all they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all of this cooked thirty feet from you. so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva. These children played with a ninja like ability, one moment in front of you, you blink, and just as fast as you blinked they disappeared. It took me an hour at least to find @PERSON1 in that small room. As I realized though it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and nearly unbearable surface @PERSON1 was in front of me. @CAPS1 had this ear to ear grin on his face that scared me, @CAPS1 never had that big of a grin on his face unless @CAPS1 had a plan. @CAPS1 definitely had a plan, in seconds my face was soaked.  @CAPS1 had been concealing a squirt gun behind his back, and had the escape route planned out. With the chairs and the short tables how they sat long legs and weaving through them did not go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we hit the hallway and I could extend my legs it was an easy run. His ear to ear grin disappeared once I caught him, but the laughter on both sides did not. @CAPS1 @MONTH1 have got my face but I got his head! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still party hard, but thanks to us no more squirt guns. I think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school. @PERSON1 is a very smart, athletic and good child. @CAPS1 will be just fine in school, plus @CAPS1 is strong so I pity the child who fights him..(How ya doin', Bernie?).mony, mony   Come on!.I don't care if you don't want me   'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow..It will stay with us

Beauty and passion   Stardust and high class scenes   Of popular teens   When I lived in Denver   I met a millionaire   With ribbons in her blond hair   I still remember   She was like a princess

" I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that alot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in it's own way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.                         So @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3..When is the new beginning,   The end of this sad Madrigal..(""'Riginal."").And cause discontent until They,   Ceasing their investigation,   Bring back the days events,

you there was peace unknown   I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb   I was soft inside   There was something going on   You do something to me that I can't explain   Hold me closer and I feel no pain   Every beat of my heart   We got something going on   Tender love is blind   It requires a dedication   All this love we feel needs no conversation   We can ride it together, ah ha   Making love with each other, ah ha      Islands in the stream   That is what we are   No one in between   How can we be wrong   Sail away with me   To another world   And we rely on each other, ah ha   From one lover to another, ah ha      I can't live without you if the love was gone   Everything is nothing when you got no one   And you walk in the night   Slowly losing sight of the real thing   But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt   Too deep in love and we got no way out   And the message is clear   This could be the year for the real thing   No more will you cry   Baby I will hurt you never   We start and end as one   In love forever   We can ride it together, ah ha   Making love with each other, ah ha      Islands in the stream   That is what we are   No one in between   How can we be wrong   Sail away with me   To another world   And we rely on each other, ah ha   From one lover to another, ah ha.These feelings may change as we all walk this way   The youth steal the ship as this generation fades....You changed the scenery,   the tender touch, the urge to breathe,   There under a lovelit sun   What's lost could be found..Off in the nether lands   I heard a sound   Like the beating of heavenly wings   And deep in my brain   I can hear a refrain   Of my soul as she rises and sings   Anthems to glory and   Anthems to love and   Hymns filled with early delight   Like the songs that the darkness   Composes to worship the light..I've done all of the old ones..Out in the back I'm   watching the score..You pretend that it just doesn't matter,   Try to keep smilin' baby hope against hope."
" Laughter @MONTH1 be the best part of life. It usually expresses the feeling of happiness and joy. The expression almost seems contagious in a way, one laugh that goes hand in hand with a smile could improve someones day drastically. Possibly the best part about laughter is that it is not hard to come by, there are many things in our world that are worthy of laughter. I have personally find myself laughing most when I am around people that I enjoy being with. Some people think the key to happiness @MONTH1 be love or joy, or possibly being happy with yourself. I think the key is surrounding yourself with the ones you love and care for because everything seems better when they are around. They are comparable to sunshine, everything is better in its presence.  My favorite memory that involved excessive laughter took place on a warm @DATE1 day at my friend's house just outside of city limits. It must have been around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. The @DATE1 air was warm, but not overwhelmingly hot. It seemed like the perfect afternoon. My friends and I were hanging out, playing catch with a football, building a fire, and being happy. We had all the components needed to have the best night of our lives. The most vivid memory I have is when we were playing catch, I threw a deep pass to my friend and as he he was running under the ball, he ran straight into a fence. He got up laughing, and the laughter spread. That, you could say, set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of the @TIME1 seemed like it could have been straight out of a movie. Everything was going right and we were all feeling good. It was the quintessence of happiness. Laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us. It had to me my best memory of laughter..The welfare people when they come   To the house you told me to say nothing   Every time they want to take me away   You say everything is alright   who's bins am I gonna eat out of tonight?.Dreams I had just last night   Made me scared, white with fright   But I'm over to that sunnyside road   Over to that sunnyside road      Fortunes come and fortunes go   But things get better babe, that's one thing I know   And I'm over to that Sunnyside road   Over to that Sunnyside road      I have a friend that I have met   Who gives me love and a certain respect   Just a little respect, everybody needs just a little respect   That means you...you...

gone   A long lost fortress   Armed only with liberty   And the key of my willingness      Fell down on my knees and prayed   ""Thy will be done""   I turned around, saw a light shining through   The door was wide open.What do you think to that?.One, two, three, four   You've got a lot to say   Every night and every sunny day   It's the same thing you've been sayin' to me   Every day   You say

"  Laughter is the esscense of life. Without laughter my life would be meaningless, and without that sense of happiness or compassion, life wouldnt be worth living. My sister is the only person i trust with my secrets. She is the only one who makes me happy when i feel down. My sister and I, laugh with eachother at our own jokes. My sister is my other half and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when i need her. I'll always be there for her also. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2, my sister and I laugh and play. One day I came off the bus from school, all i could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a river flowing. The bus appeared and a sense of joy appeared with it. @CAPS1, it wasnt the bus that brought my joy. It was my sister, right away she could feel my pain and noticed my tears. I could see in her face, the love and care. She asked me whats wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. @CAPS1 need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said,""@CAPS1 matter whatever happens, I'll always love you."" @CAPS2 we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh. A chorus of laughter filled the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it..I call it thirst trap, shawty, oh!.Hallelujah, Jesus is alive   Death has lost its victory   And the grave has been denied   And Jesus lives forever   He's alive, He's alive      He's the alpha and omega   The first and last is He   The curse of sin is broken   And we have perfect liberty   The lamb of God has risen   He's alive, He's alive      Hallelujah, Jesus is alive   Death has lost its victory   And the grave has been denied   Jesus lives forever   He's alive, He's alive      He's the alpha and omega   The first and last is He   The curse of sin is broken   And we have perfect liberty   The lamb of God has risen   He's alive, He's alive      Hallelujah, Jesus is alive   Death has lost its victory   And the grave has been denied   Jesus lives forever   He's alive, He's alive      He's the alpha and omega   The first and last is He   The curse of sin is broken   We have perfect liberty   The lamb of God has risen   He's alive, He's alive      Hallelujah, Jesus is alive   He's alive, He's alive   He's alive, He's alive   Yes, He's alive.Thenardier   Everyone here, you know your place   Brujon, Babet, Claqusous   You, Montparnasse, watch for the law   With Eponine, take care..Gotta have some of that Brown Sugar   As long as that's gonna set me free..(j.

" The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure. Shadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I said things that were unnecessary and horrible. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. I turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS1 pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat and immediately @CAPS1 knew something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer, ""@PERSON1.""  @CAPS1 knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS1 did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession. Bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again and then @CAPS1 asked me, ""@CAPS2 you feel better now that you got it all out?"" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, payed, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke @CAPS1 told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And there have always been there proving I can count on them.  That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if your counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS2 it ten make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear. I hope that one day when I am old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magical. It can make a sad man glad, make sunshine on a cloudy day, and make light of the darkest situations..Looks like I'll go on through my life bound in sorrow   I'm a loser right from the start   Now I've

with a wisdom that astounds me   Like the horizon, he draws my eye to him and he makes me see just how lonely I have been      He knows what I'm thinking without a sign, without blinking my eyes   I know what he's asking, in our love there ain't no masking, no disguise   I know what he's after, it's the truth and the laughter   Why can't we see in ourselves, all the beauty we see in everybody else?.With every step I take I get one step in step with you   With every move you make I can't wait to make my move   Got your voice buzzing in my head and a rollercoaster down my spine   Well don't

" Someone once said,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1, to me that means, that since everyone laughs, laughter is the quickest or easiest way to connect with another person. I believe this because at one point in time my older brother and I did not get along very well. We were almost never around each other, and when we were,we would either be fighting or ignoring one another. It wasn't much of a problem since he is five years older; but once I became older my brother and I began to see one another more often. So we then decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't exactly sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes we just sat there in silence. Just two guys on the back porch in the middle of the @TIME1. Then out of no were he fell over backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we have ever laughed in our lives. So @CAPS1, when my family get together, there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit and tell stories and laugh.For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important components of a relationship because, with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life. So I say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between all people."".Word up, that's what I'm talking about   All you gotta do is hit me, word, I'll call you right back   Yeah, ?.- leg die haende auf

" This true story might sound some what cheesy, but its true and in my opinion its a love story. I will be substituting the real names with others names though. On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log on @CAPS1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to @PERSON2. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 had accepted @PERSON1's request that's when @PERSON1 remembered about the request. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, @CAPS9 before the had no clue who the other one was. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after along chat, @CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of @CAPS1-book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knew that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @NUM1 and also have friends in common. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked talking to @PERSON2 a lot. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean ""a lot"", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked that because it always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, @PERSON2 didn't mind, he @CAPS4 liked @PERSON1. He had a @CAPS4 big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12... he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said... ""@CAPS3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend"".  ""@CAPS4 you would?"" @CAPS5 @PERSON2.  ""@CAPS3 why wouldn't I? replied @PERSON1. ""@CAPS6 I thought that you wouldn't @CAPS9 you recently got out of a relationship"" @PERSON2 answered. Days had past they were doing perfectly until... @PERSON1 starting to receive texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect @PERSON1's relationship with @PERSON2.But the bad thing was that @PERSON1 was still in love with @PERSON3. @PERSON2 knew that for one. But that didn't stop @PERSON2 from fighting to get @LOCATION1's @CAPS7. @PERSON1 is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS12 one night while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 were talking on the phone, @PERSON2 decided to ask @PERSON1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything.""@CAPS9 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 have a @CAPS4 good communication when laughing is involved, @PERSON1 changed the subject and @CAPS5 @PERSON2 if he was willing on doing her a favor. Of course @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3"". The favor that @PERSON1 had @CAPS5 @PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed. ""@CAPS12 can you do me that favor? @PERSON1 @CAPS5. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it @CAPS12 much better. @CAPS3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting @NUM2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. @CAPS6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships. .Ascendentem ad aethera   Nubes excepit lucida,   Ferebatur   Erectis manibus   Benedicens   Suis astantibus..Sometimes I think I'm gonna better myself,   Searching for acceptance in this big, wide world..Ahhhhhh oooooo      This is the way   I always dreamed it would be   The way that it is, oh oh   When you are holding me   I never had a love of my own   Maybe that's why when we're all alone      I can hear music   I can hear music   The sound of the city baby seems to disappear   I can hear music   Sweet sweet music   Whenever you touch me baby   Whenever you're near      Lovin' you   It keeps me satisfied   And I can't explain, oh no   The way I'm feeling inside   You look at me we kiss and then   I close my eyes and here it comes again      I can hear music   I can hear music   The sound of the city baby seems to disappear   I can hear music   Sweet sweet music   Whenever you touch me baby   Whenever you're near      I hear the music all the time, yeah   I hear the music, hold me tight now baby   I hear the music all the time   I hear the music   I hear the music (baby)      Ahhhhh      I can hear music   I can hear music   The sound of the city baby seems to disappear   I can hear music   Sweet sweet music   Whenever you touch me baby   Whenever you're near.Raindrops keep fallin' on my head   And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed   Nothin' seems to fit   Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'      So I just did me some talkin' to the sun   And I said I didn't like the way he got things done   Sleepin' on the job   Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'      But there's one thing I know   The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me   It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me      Raindrops keep fallin' on my head   But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red   Cryin's not for me   'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'   Because I'm free   Nothin's worryin' me      It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me      Raindrops keep fallin' on my head   But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red   Cryin's not for me   'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'   Because I'm free   Nothin's worryin' me.You don't even know, cause when it's real you fall too hard..Love to...

"                             ""Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life..When I go home, the moon goes with me and my shadow follows me"".God is able   He will never

"Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!.They picked up guns and hammers   (Where did they go?).Mr..Bible says it's a good thing to give thanks to the Lord, amen   I come

"@CAPS1.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS6 my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS6 I was @CAPS5 I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS6 people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better.

" As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be."" @CAPS1 by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It @MONTH1 be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring..But there's just one, face that I see   She's the only one

" LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.  .I like this curious feeling..Fire, I'll take you to burn..Maybe you're trying to use me   Flying too high can confuse

" Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language."".From the moment of our inception   Yeah we were destined   To be together (together)   Two planets on a cosmic collision   Yeah were on a mission   To last forever      [Chorus:]   And so gravity took hold   And it's never letting me go   Like a tractor beam   To infinity lost sense of all control      And our love is written in the stars   Already written in the stars   If I'm from Venus you're from Mars   Our love is written in the stars      Uh, oh, eh, eh   Eh, uh, oh      I see your name spelled out in the sky   Lighting the night like a constellation   Now let's be touch (go for a ride)   The speed of light a supernova sensation      [Chorus:]   And so gravity took hold   And it's never letting me go   Like a tractor beam   To infinity lost sense of all control      And our love is written in the stars   Already written in the stars   If I'm from Venus you're from Mars   Our love is written in the stars      Uh, oh, eh, eh, eh, uh, oh   It's written in the stars, oh   Eh, eh, yeah, yeah, eh, eh      I need your forcefields   I gotta keep it real   To keep me from burning (burning oh)   Don't want to drift away   Floating in outer space   There's no way I'm returning oh      And our love is written in the stars   Already written in the stars   If I'm from Venus you're from Mars   Our love is written in the stars      And our love is written in the stars   Already written in the stars   If I'm from Venus you're from Mars   Our love is written in the stars      Oh, oh, eh, eh, eh, It's written in the stars   Oh, oh, eh, eh, it's written in the stars.My baby left me   She wouldn't tell a lie   Cause she said she would, she did   And she left me high and dry   My baby left me   Last night I heard her cry   She wouldn't tell me why   She just said bye-bye      I used to sing the blues   I thought I sang for real   Now I know the feel   And it hurts too much   My baby left me   She left me all alone   She's never coming home   And I want to die      My baby left me, my baby left me.I don't want to be treated this away..[Nicki Minaj:]   Shots fire,   Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire   You don't hear them bums or nothin', that's fire   Tell 'em, catch buyer   In the Bugatti ten years and one tire   Ayo Madonna, maybe I say you original don dada   In that, yeah Gabbana, and the, yeah Prada   We material girls, ain't nobody hotter""   See I really can't relate to your Volvo   And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo   When I let a dude go, that's his loss   I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!.Free (Be glad that you are free)   Free to change my mind (Free to change your mind)   Free to go most anywhere, anytime (Free to go most anywhere,anytime)   I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free, yeah (Be glad that you are free)   There's many a man who's not (There's many a man who's not)   Glad for what I had baby, (Be glad for what you had and)   Glad for what I got, oh yeah (for what you've got)   Oh I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free,yeah (Be glad that you are free)   Free to change my mind (Free to change your mind)   Free to go most anywhere, anytime (Free to go most anywhere, anytime)   (Be glad that you are free)   (There's many a man who's not)   I'm so (Be glad for what you had and for)   (what you've got).They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,   I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!)..Deadly assassins...   all up in your nugget...

"The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter, one of the best feelings an individual can achieve. When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH1 not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter-filled relationships is an important element to someone's well being. Sharing a @CAPS3 is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS3 when someone else is laughing. Everyone has their own @CAPS3 too. Sometimes, it is someone's @CAPS3 that provokes laughter within the group. Making others @CAPS3 is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS3. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman @CAPS4' book, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" explains the powers of laughter in detail. @CAPS4 watched The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and laughed himself to wellness. He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life..Are you lonesome tonight ?.The one thing that you're missing is loungin' on the

"  I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them. After first half we scored @NUM1 goals so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.  .This is love....Side by side, I'll be yours forever   Rain or shine, any kind of weather   There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you   Let's take what's getting old and make it new      Oh, eye to eye, it's a blinding confrontation   You and I, we're a deadly combination   So don't start mixing truth with jealousy   The road we're on is clear as far as I can see      Pamela, don't break this heart of mine   Just remember, it may not heal this time   Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind      Black and white always go together   Day and night you're the precious jewel I treasure   Wanting every part of you is not a crime   Or could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time      Pamela, don't break this heart of mine   Just remember, it may not heal this time   Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind      All that I love (all that I love)   Thousands of miles away, but always in my heart      Pamela, don't break this heart of mine   Just remember, it may not heal this time   Pamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind.Dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding   Dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding dinge dinge ding   (Dale dale!).This is my description of an ugliness..Take an empty milk bottle   Full it full with gasoline   Stuff a gassed soap rag into the mouth of the bottle   You cork the top and presto!.People please can you hear me..Not a speck of light is showing   So the danger must be growing   Are the fires of hell a glowing?.(Bring you down)   Turn away, find a way, your own   I'll be here waiting for you to say   Turn away, find a way, your own   (Turn away)   I'll still be calling your name   Turn away, find a way of your own   I'll be here waiting for you to say   Turn away, find a way, your own   (Turn away)   I'll still be calling your name   Turn away, find a way of your own   I'll be here waiting for you to say   Turn away, find a way, your own   (Turn away)   I'll still be calling your name   Turn away, find a way of your own   I'll be here waiting for you to say   Turn away, find a way, your own   (Turn away)   I'll still be calling your name.Yes, I see their faces one by one..I said Jesus, Mary, and the Saints above,   Won't you show him love?.Faith-talkin' people,   Seems like such a mystery..(Huh?).No apology necessary shut your mouth   You've closed your mind   We've been walking this road forever   It don't lead to paradise      In the mirror your sad reflection haunting you   Now I see mine   Yes I see mine   And you just don't get it      But you just might regret it, you might regret it   Shooting the rainbows from the sky   Throwing your love to passers by   Begging forgiveness for your crime      Never prepared to do your time   It's always them and never you   'Cause you're so see through, I see through you   ('Cause you're so see thru)      Ain't no use in demanding justice   You're a victim of your sight   I held you up when your heart was heavy   Now you never give me mine      In the mirror my sad reflection haunting me   One more time, one more time   And you just don't get it, do ya?.Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?.c'mon, I'll be your satellite of love      Ooh ooh   Ah ah   Ooh ooh   Ah ah      Spotlight magnetic razor rhythm laser love   Guitar, drums, load up, stun!.And so we danced   Though it was only a slow dance,   I started breaking my promises right there and then      Didn't I swear   There would be no complications?.I spent a lot of time looking for me in your eyes   I spent a lot of nights sleeping on the end of our bed   Then I realize that this time, time won't tell   People like myself can't compromise this well      And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,   Won't let go so easily....I am thinkin' 'bout the days   We led ourselves astray   In more than many ways   (Here) Here, within the time we've spent   Wonderin' what we meant   By livin' all those years   (Here) By livin' all those years   (Here) By livin' all those years   (Here) By livin' all those years   (Here) By livin' all those years   (Here, here, here).You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life   See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen      Friday night and the lights are low   Looking out for the place to go   Where they play the right music, getting in the swing   You come in to look for a King   Anybody could be that guy   Night is young and the music's high   With a bit of rock music, everything is fine   You're in the mood for a dance   And when you get the chance...

" I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along..These city streets make you feel so cold   It's got so many people but it's got no soul   And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong   When you thought

" Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh everyday. People wouldn't be the same without laughter, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time..[Speech]      Brian Matthew: But despite the fact that the next request comes from Anton, 32   Perry Road, Sherwood, in Nottingham, it's headed ""Up the Pool"" and starts,   ""Dear Wack!"".Have you heard of the one called Savior?.Why, oh why should you desert me   Are you doin' this for spite   If you only want to hurt me   Then there'll be no teardrops tonight..But every brother is your brother   Can you hear me?.Don't be surprised when you swallow more than pride..The more you touch, the more you feel   It's just a picture that you thought was real   The less you need, the more you know   You can say the prophet told you so   Do do dooo   CHORUS   You and me, we've got enough   We live inside the body glove   You and me, we live for love   Deep inside the body glove   You and me, we've got enough   We live inside the body glove   You and Me, we live for love   Deep inside the body glove   The body glove..Feels like lead      It weighs a ton, let's see if we can dump it by the side of the hill      Hey wait up, why don't you dump it on the burning ground      Dump it down there      Yeh man, dump the Jute      Hey man dump the Jute on the burning ground      Dump the Jute?.If you need me I'll always be there....Oh - don't you leave without saying goodbye..Chorus:   I take one step away   Then I find myself coming back to you   My one and only, one and only you...

"A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago @CAPS4 I meet my friend @CAPS1. I meet her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's @CAPS4, @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, ""@CAPS3 watch where your going!"" @CAPS4 we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS5 its @CAPS6, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk."" We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved band. @CAPS1 and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS4 you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS1 until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way..I'm back in the sea..What's so strange when you know that   You're a wizard at three?.Home, build it behind your eyes,   Carry it in your heart,   Safe among your own..Woe, it worries me..Nancy: Not for me, the happy home:   Happy husband, happy wife..Now, if an opinion should become between us..I know a cabin down there in Tennessee   Where you can't find the forest on account of the trees   And Old Perry Foster he got something to say   And you can smell the pigs 'cause'

I'm gonna raise my glass yeah to Thunderhead Hawkins      Miss Mary Jane she always looks like a star   But the rock n roll banker likes to sleep in his car   You won't hear no opry you'll hear six strings   And you won't know what to do when you hear Thunderhead sing      [Chorus]      Now Mr. Hawkins got a family tree   He got that their legendary cabin down in Tennessee   You know he'll hook up that guitar everybody gather round   You stay close to the fire when the sun goes down   Old Brother Merle he's always waiting in the wings   Only man up in them woods wearin' all them gold rings   Old Mr. Hawkins he won't do nobody wrong   But he'll he'll tear your heart out with one sad song      [Chorus].But I don't mind, as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine..Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me   See on the portal he's waiting and watching watching for you and for me   Come home come home ye who are weary come home   Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home      Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading pleading for you and for me   Why should we linger and heed not his mercies mercies for you and for me   Come home come home.There was this girl   Who lived not too long ago   As a matter of fact I think   She lives still   She knew she could do no wrong   Just singin' those songs   That we all knew      She would always crash the party   It was no surprise   It was for her      Too Cool Queenie      There was this boy   He played in a rock-n-roll band   And he wasn't half-bad,   At saving the world   She said he could do no right   So he took his life   His story is true      It's OK cause what goes around, comes around   It's all right cause what goes around, comes around      And now this girl,   Yeah she got real famous   And she made lots of money and   Some of his too   But still she thinks she can do no wrong   Just playing those songs   She's all too cool.Once there was a way   To get

"                                @CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is a powerful tool when you know how to use it. It has the ability to inspire, when in doubt. Lift heavy spirts to new heights, and it can also create great devotion, to a person, thing or cause. So what has laughter done for you and I? Well it has done lots for me, a good example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION2.  At @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3 I had everything going for me. I had good grades, teachers, but most of all a group of friends that I could share many laughs with. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION3 my friends either moved or dispersed into other groups. It was horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things pretty tough. Then came the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Since I wasn't really envoled in the program I didn't have any friends, save vanecek. Then an opportunity it join the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 arose, I took it. Every afternoon for one hour we had practice, which in turn created a strong bond between the @ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting we would laugh it up and relax, making it a fun enviroment to shoot. The @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The @ORGANIZATION2, which my battalion as a part of, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family. My family, seeing how I was nervous, took me aside the night before the shoot-out. We played cards, talked and cracked jokes, it was the one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous just relaxed. Out of twenty four man teams we took third, not bad for a new famliy. Since then the @ORGANIZATION4 has taken first, four times in a row. Those victories I have to give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter in a way has inspired me to devote myself to a family, and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS4 @CAPS1 are you part of?.Tell me, who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?.Don't ya know that I....In a sleepy little border town   Lives the cutest girl   For miles around   Never dreamed of things   Like wealth and fame   Oh Donna is her name..If you're bad then you gotta pay for your wrongs..We lose our grip, we glide and stall..They never bothered asking why   She stayed looked up inside,   Watching as the world turns by..Baby it's no mystery   You don't have to tell me   What you're doing here   With all the stars in your blue eyes   Washed away by disappointed tears      You say another love has left you   Feeling sad and insecure   You'd like to think that it's all worth it   But now you're not so sure   Baby just because it's painful   It doesn't mean it's real   Sometimes we're simply desperate   For something to feel, uh-huh   Don't underestimate love      It's the same old bedtime story   The same old dreams of glory   We all hold on to   It's all so beautifully tragic   So painfully romantic   But so far from the truth      Baby I could slay your dragons   But I'd rather set them free   All I'm really asking is a chance to make you see   There doesn't have to be a struggle   There doesn't have to be a fight   Before you taste the victory   Before you feel it's right, uh-huh   Don't underestimate love      Oh we all look for love in our lives   But sometimes all you've gotta do is just open up your eyes   But does there have to be a reason   Or does there have to be a storm   Before we we look for shelter in each others arms   Baby leave behind this madness   I'll give you tenderness   I don't wanna see you have to settle for less, uh-huh   Don't underestimate love   Don't underestimate love.Forget what we're told   Before we get too old   Show me a garden   That's bursting into life   Let's waste time   Chasing cars   Around our heads   I need your grace   To remind me   To find my own   If I lay here   If I just lay here   Would you lie with me   And just forget the world?.Gon' gamble with it, show me I'm da man (man)   Shake it on da flo', like dice pon' ya hand   Lemme see dat ass roll, roll, roll, roll, roll   They go!.An eye for an eye   And a truth for a truth   And anyway I told the truth   But I'm afraid I told a lie.There's a good life   Right across this green field   And each generation   Stares at it from afar   But we keep no check   On our appetites   So the green fields turn to brown   Like paper in fire      Paper in fire   Stinkin' up the ashtrays   Paper in fire   Blowin' down the alleyways   Who's to say the way   A man should spend his days   Do you let them smolder   Like paper in fire?.Hometown lady, leavin' for the city   Bags in hand, she's boardin' the train   Her last look through the window, I saw her eyes were as red as mine   I waved goodbye but I can't believe she's leaving..You could sail across the water take the kids and set me free   You could die and go to heaven but you'll always live inside of me   You'll always live inside of me girl you'll always live inside of me   No one else will ever take your place you'll always live inside of me      They could take me back to prison they could throw away the key   Just as long as I am breathin' you'll always live inside of me   You'll always live inside of me girl...   You'll always live inside of me girl....Fool, I kill at will and still can fade that shit, 'cause it's the   Predator, I edit her, so nigga watch yo step!.(You know that even when I'm far away, I'm still with you.).(She's tight.).They robbin' niggas on the daily   Keep on blamin' nigga that ain't never had things   Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like   Uh, nice watch, run it   Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it   Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it   Hands in the air now, hands in the air   Hands in the air now, hands in the air      Father forgive me for me, childish ways   I look outside and all the clouds are gray   I need your hands to take me, miles away   Your wish is my command, my command, my command, but   Before you go I've got to, want you now   Whatever goes up surely, must come down   And you get your piece but no peace, won't be found   So why just take me man, take me man, take me man   Your wish is my command, my command, my command.where will you go, where will you go?.Don't know   What I was looking for   When I went home   I found me alone   And sometimes   I need someone to say you'll be all right   What's on your mind?.At this time of night, when the crowds have passed   We're the last to leave, we need some company   No need to look so shy, don't even wonder why   You know the reason that we need this company   I've been sitting here, looking out for you   Someone just like me, who's maybe had a drink or two      [Chorus]   I don't want another drink or fight   I want a lover   I don't care whether it's wrong or right   I want a lover tonight   Tonight      Outside the dawn is breaking, looks like it's started raining   We'll catch a cab, and soon be driving home   No need to look so shy, don't even wonder why   You'll know the reason just as soon as we get home   You've been sitting there, wondering what to do   I've been standing here, waiting to make the first move      [Chorus: x2]      This anticipation is a stimulation   No need for conversation as we're driving home   Put your arms around me, it doesn't mean you love me   Just that you want me and you need my company   Driving through the night, it's so exciting   Turning off the light without another thought tonight      [Chorus: x2]      (I want you, I want your love) I want a lover   (I want you, I want your love) I want a lover   (I want you, I want your love) I want a lover (I want your love tonight)   Oh.In my mind, the battle goes on 'til I give up   Will we find, the key of life we once have dropped?.Cross out every emotion..He's comin' so I better run   'cause he would know I never fail..Are you going to Scarborough Fair?.Escape my find!.Hey..

" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those great times last @DATE1 and all the ones to come. Some people think were weird but if you knew us you would understand. Sometimes people say, ""I'm going to die laughing."" @CAPS2 i know I am because of @PERSON1, she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together i could there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times.  First of all, this friendship started the @DATE1, and now we are in sophomore @DATE1 of high school. We've been friends for one @DATE1 and eleven months and six days. We are the best of best of friends.  So last @DATE1 when we were learning the cheers for football season, all most every-time we got done with a cheer, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I would say, ""@CAPS3-in @CAPS4."" That was our saying, and we always did it @DATE1 and after the football or basketball games. We called it our @CAPS3-in @CAPS4 style or for short our slogan. We would be having a blast and laughing for hours.  ""@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn,"" In @DATE2 we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION1, every-time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. Oh @CAPS1 goodness we laughed and we had a blast. After the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 turns, there was another motion we called the monkey and we would act like monkeys. It was so much fun we laughed. We also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really bad.That was one of many car rides that was amazing.  On the other hand, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I, cheer together, we have sleepovers, @CAPS2 i should say that we do everything together. She is @CAPS1 cheer sister and will always be, also she is @CAPS1 best friend.I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1 @PERSON1.  In addition, to the we do everything together. When @PERSON1 is over at @CAPS1 house I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so i went and made all of that and @PERSON1 loved it so now i have to make sure i have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the becomes of the sandwich habit.b we laugh about it all the time.  Finally, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever, because i don't know what i would do with out @CAPS1 sister. I would not be the person who I am today with out her she and everything to me we laugh even when we want to cry she is everthing to me. You could say we have a perfect freindship of all time. @CAPS1 bestfriend is @CAPS1 sister I love you @PERSON1, thanks for alays having @CAPS1 back.                                             .Let's go out   On an ocean ride   Leave all your cares   And the past behind      Let's venture out   To a deserted isle   Let's get in touch   With what is alive      Ohhh I love you   Ohhh it's wonderful   Ohhh it's magical      Let's get high   Let's get high   Let's get high   High on this feeling of love      Let's go out   On an ocean ride   We'll tell no one   We'll just go and hide   Just spread your wings   And go with the tide   Let our love be our one desire      Ohhh I love you   Ohhh it's wonderful   Ohhh it's magical      Let's get high   Let's get high   Let's get high   High on this feeling of love      Ohhh I love you   Ohhh it's wonderful   Ohhh it's magical      Let's get high   Let's get high   Let's get high   High on this feeling of love.So she smiled at you when you saw her today   And you're still thinking bout the things she had to say   She said leaving you was hard to do and it's sad we had to part   But don't let it go to your heart   So she told you she thinks of you now and then   Now you're thinking she might take you back again   But it's only cause she's lonely and she's about to fall apart   So don't let it go to your heart   Cause I'm your heart and I can tell you that it doesn't mean a thing   She's just like you she hangs on to a helpless hopeless dream   She's made the break and it's hard to take   As you watch her teardrops start   But don't let it go to your heart   [ guitar ]   Cause I'm your heart...   No don't let it go to your heart.[Chorus]      Bring in the noise   Bring in the noise      Just shake it girl   And enjoy the ride   Do what you feel inside   'Cause it's your world   All you wanted more   So baby go and get yours      I've got that feeling baby   You know it drives me crazy   And all I want to do is hit the floor   I want to shout it y'all   So make it louder y'all   And turn it up some more      [Chorus]      Bring in the noise [Repeat: x4]      I've got that feeling baby   You know it drives me crazy   And all I want to do is hit the floor      [Chorus: Repeats].Oh city shine on tomorrow   For today I feel rain   There is a decent moon   Now I lay me down in the light      My man's afraid, no communication   I'm sure life in my arms ain't been free   Is it a sacrifice to love me now   Are you alright?.Once our love was drifting   I felt left out and alone   There was nothing more that I could do   I lost my hold on you      And through it all I kept my faith   In the good things from the past   Then one day out of the blue   You came back to me      In time, everything changes   Nothing stays the same   Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1   We're like the morning sun   In time, everything changes   Troubles disappear   Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1   We're like the morning sun      Holding on to something   'cause it feels so right   You don't doubt it for a minute   Day or night      You know you've got to keep the faith   Don't let it slip away   Knew one day that you'd return   And together we will stay      In time, everything changes   Nothing stays the same   Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1   We're like the morning sun   In time, everything changes   Troubles disappear   Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1   We're like the morning sun      If we believe there's a future   Take the time to remember   That the setting sun will always rise again      In time, everything changes   Nothing stays the same   Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1   We're like the morning sun   In time, everything changes   Troubles disappear   Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1   We're like the morning sun.That may be all I need to know..If I could save time in a bottle   The first thing that I'd like to do   Is to save every day   'Til eternity passes away   Just to spend them with you      If I could make days last forever   If words could make wishes come true   I'd save every day like a treasure and then,   Again, I would spend them with you      [Chorus]   But there never seems to be enough time   To do the things you want to do   Once you find them   I've looked around enough to know   That you're the one I want to go   Through time with      If I had a box just for wishes   And dreams that had never come true   The box would be empty   Except for the memory   Of how they were answered by you      [Chorus].Are you with it this Christmas?.I want to see more..With each word your tenderness grows,   Tearing my fears apart   And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,   Touches my foolish heart..Everything to decide   It's time I came up with some answers before I can carry on   It's time I made my mind up before we can go along      And I thought it was so simple   And I knew that it could be so fine   I know that the places that everything comes      Rose beds scattered across the lawn   Like the squares at Waterloo   With the bayonets of thorns repelling   Small children in search of lost tennis balls   Seeing everything and giving their all      I used to be scared of heights   I used to get dizzy   I never felt safe with my feet on the ground   They said that up there the air would be clearer   They said more space and more room to breathe      Everything to the side   I knew that something would happen   It's better off than being alive   I knew the standards decline   I knew that we had to decide   All the places that all we'd ever seen   And the place that we thought about   And the road that you travel has never been seen      Rose beds scattered across the lawn   Like the squares of Waterloo   With the bayonets of thorns repelling   Small children in search of lost tennis balls   Giving everything and giving it all      I used to think everything was coming up roses   But I couldn't see the weeds that entangled my feet   I couldn't see the trees   'Cause my forest was burning   I couldn't see the bridges the fire in my eyes   They sold me the view from the hill   They sold me the view from the hill      They said that up there the air would be clearer   They said more space and more room to breathe   I used to be scared of heights   I used to get dizzy   They sold me the view from the hill.Tryna get that koby number, one over jordon      [Jay-Z]

" It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy..In my bed I watch T.V..In the talkies holding hands perhaps, all you girls and chaps,   On each others laps..I look to you..I don't mind   I'm so glad to grow older   To move away from those darker years   Oh, I'm in love for the first time   And I don't feel bad   So wish me luck my friends   Goodbye   So wish me luck again   Goodbye   Wish me luck my friends   Goodbye   Mmm... wish me luck, my friends   Goodbye   Ahh...   Ahh....She wakes and takes her place in line   And never bothers to ask why the mirror sheds no light at all   The days turn into lesser days until there's only night   The light it wouldn't help she's too far gone      Her time is up it's five o'clock   It never stops      And she says please, and she says please   And she says please, watch over me      I watch her slowly make her way   Down on a road she shouldn't take   She always ends where she began      The years go by, they're adding up   She clicks her heels but she's still stuck   She's giving in but won't give up she'll never

"                                        A day with the family  One day my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and i had gone out to eat at @ORGANIZATION2 for breakfast. They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS2 much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS1 where my cousin @PERSON1 farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS2 many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS2 hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS2 bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom ""I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have"".  Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us @CAPS2 we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS2 we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out ""wicked witch of the west""! He frowns at me and says, ""@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out."" @CAPS2 i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS2 confused. My cousins shouts out ""poop""! My brother yells ""@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop""! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS2 dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME1.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good. .Musical chairs, double dares, memorized stairs,   Shootin off flares, springtime hares and broken-down mares      Coward phones, big soup

the heart of the beast   With my beliefs and possessions, stopped at the frontier in my chest   At the edge of my country, my back to the sea, looking east      Where the search for the truth is conducted with a wink and a nod   And where power and position are equated with the grace of God   These times are famine for the soul while for the senses it's a feast   From the edge of my country,

Trouble their minds day in and day out   Too busy a livin' to worry about a thing called love      And then I see a mother's tenderness   As she holds her young close to her breast   Then I say thank God this world will win with the thing called love..I'll worship at Your throne   Whisper my own love song   With all my heart I'll sing   For You, my dad and King   I'll live for all my days   To put a smile on Your face   And when we finally meet   It'll be for eternity   And oh, how wide You open up Your arms   When I need Your love   And how far You would come   If ever I was lost   You said that all You feel for me   Is undying love   That You showed me through the cross   I'll worship You, my God   I'll worship You, my God   I love You, I love You   Forever I will sing   Forever I will be with You   I'll be with You   I'll worship at Your throne   Whisper my own love song   With all my heart I'll sing   For You, my dad and King   I'll live for all my days   To put a smile on Your face   And when we finally meet   It'll be for eternity   And oh, how wide You open up Your arms   When I need Your love   And how far You would come   If ever I was lost   You said that all You feel for me   Is undying love   That You showed me through the cross   I'll worship You, my God   I'll worship You, my God   I love You, I love You   Forever I will sing   Forever I will be with You   I'll be with You   I'll worship You, my God   I'll worship You, my God   I love You and I love You   Forever I will sing   Forever I will be with You   I'll be with You.[Pre-Chorus 2]   Down in the forest,   We'll sing a chorus."
" Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is made that is like no other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this @LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings. Last @DATE2, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with @PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON1 came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a good time and enjoying the warm night. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that @DATE1. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, OR. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie-dyed shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were in the back with another girl in between them so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the @NUM2 @NUM3 hour car ride we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story telling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds which made for a very entertaining car ride.  At the tournament, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roomates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other.  Laughter is what brought @PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting @NUM4 girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making other laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter, and united together as one..Papers      I can't, get to work on time,   Can't believe the words to her I just said   But who the hell argue

"It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON2 who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it..Stay with me, baby..I got deuces on my coop   Put 2 swishers together look like I'm blowing on the flute   Yeah nigga we... We ride up on you   ... And teddy bear, it's not....My life is just like the weather   It changes with the hours   When he's near I'm fair and warmer   When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers   An emotion like the ocean   It's either sink or swim   When a woman loves a man   Like I love him   Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should   I got it bad and that ain't good   My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood   I got it bad and that ain't good   But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around   I end up like I started out just cryin' my lil' heart out   He don't love me like I love him   No, nobody could, I got it bad and that ain't good   So bad, so bad   I got on it so bad, so bad though folks with good intentions   Tell me to save my tears   I'm glad, I'm mad about you, I can't live without you   Lord above me make him love me the way he should   Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood   The things I tell my pillow   No woman should   I got it bad, bad so bad and that ain't good.They always send the poor!.Unless the lord wants it done,   You better not work another day,   Building anything that will stand,   Anything that will stand, anything that will stand..That kindly jailer grinned at me, all eaten up with sympathy   Then poured himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear,   ""If booze was just a dime a bottle boy, you couldn't even buy the smell""   I

she believes..Tender like a night in June,   Sweeter than a honeymoon,   Brighter than a silver spoon,   Just as crazy as a loon..Pay no attention if I crawl across the room..Doing her wrong, taking so long   Should I do all things in my own time?.Well, she saved him from whiskey,   Was his constant companion..Hey-hey-hey!.Say you're going to stay,   And make my dreams come true....Isn't it a drag?.Late in time behold Him come   Offspring of a Virgin's womb   Veiled in flesh the Godhead see   Hail the incarnate Deity   Pleased as man with man to dwell   Jesus, our Emmanuel   Hark!.And I've done it again, done it again, done it again..You better get yourself runnin'   I got hurricane comin'   No warning surprise      I'm gonna take my leave   I wanna plant my seed   Don't let it shock you hold tight, hold tight      You better run for cover   I'm a hit-n-run lover   Run for cover tonight (get ready!).We are the wreckin' crew..Punting on the Cam is jolly fun they say   Beagling on the downs Oh please come they say      Rugger is the tops a game for men they say."
" As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile..She's begging me and asking why it's over..I got my eyes on the shit unfolding..I don't want to lose you..Saviour of the night came slowly on the silent river   And the lord of life came following, his sins to be forgiven   While the world sat back and laughed away the hours   Till the dawning of the daybreak      I heard them laugh I heard them cry   I saw them praying to the sky   I heard the wind howl in the trees   Down there on bended knee   And I see the light   But I know I must be dreaming      Feel the soul, quiet emotion   Sail on by, helpless devotion   If that's how it feels, it better be real      Take care of your woman   Or you'll never ever see the light   Take heed of the warnin'   Or you know it's gonna be too late      Here, there, everywhere   They keep on movin' without fear   They look me up, they look me down   They press my body to the ground   But I see the light, see the light it's comin' shinin'      And on a summers day   When thoughts are drifting far away   And life is good and real to see   My world is saved and I am free   But in the night   Still I know I must be dreaming.I can't stop won't stop   Usher baby   Yeah, will you do it again?.Road trip to New Orleans   Or gettin' married in Vegas   Sunsets down on the sand   Lettin' loose and goin' crazy   Somewhere, somebody tonight is falling in love   And 325 horses can't get me to you fast enough      [Chorus]   Your lips around a Coca-Cola   My hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder   Some things never go out of style   Like you and me together   Staring at your legs on the leather of my   Red Camaro      You got them cowgirl boots on   That summer dress blowin'   Girl, there ain't nothin' bout you that   Don't get to me and you know it   When it comes to love, it ain't ever changin'   Same things will always get a boys heart racin'      [Chorus]      Pulling off on the side of the dirt road   So many things that we know, but we don't know   Discovering you by the glow of the dashboard light   Falling in love in the middle of nowhere   Maybe it's wrong, but it looks like we don't care   It feels right, yeah, it feels so right   Just like      Your lips around a Coca-Cola   My hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder   And some things never go out of style   Like you and me together   Oh, birds of a feather      Your lips around a Coca-Cola   One hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder   And some things just never go out of style   Like you and me together   Staring at your legs on the black leather, of my   Red Camaro.Oh!.Your love is just a miracle..Upside down   And I can't stop it now   It can't stop me now      I, I'll get by   I, I'll survive   When the world's crashing down   When I fall and hit the ground   I will turn myself around   Don't you try to stop me?.Got my freedom riding along the freeway..I'm doing you a favor   As I'm taking all your money   I guess I should feel sorry   But I don't even trust me   There's bad news creeping up   And you feel a sudden chill   How do you do?.Peep peep!.I promise you, we gon' see the world   But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby      I mean this      Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?.Nothing can cure my headache   Cause I'm experiencing   What they call heartbreak   It's going to hurt worse   As long as I stay here   I know but man just let me lay here..when I open      I love you      (woohoooo)      I love you      (woohoooo)      I love you      (woohoooo)      I love you      ladadada      (will I have my blue eyes...)      ladadada      (...this time?).Money is the anthem, of success, so before we go out,   What's your address?.Time to grow, time to go   Hello, hello      Too young to take over,   Too old to ignore,   Gee, I'm almost ready,   But...

" These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS1 all started in the @DATE1 time when i was like @NUM1 years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS3 cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. @CAPS1 was fun having them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and my cousin @PERSON3 who lived right next to @CAPS3 would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS3 and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS1 was his. @CAPS3 and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON4 @CAPS1 was a @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS1 was just dirt but @CAPS1 was hard. One day when @CAPS1 was raining so hard @CAPS3 , @PERSON7 , @PERSON3 and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS1 was okay same with @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he could not cause @CAPS1 was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS3 straight to the shower . @CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON5 bros for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION1, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS1 was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS3 my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 would always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards back then every body had @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM2 grade @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON6 had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept over at @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 cause they would always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family. .Down in

All my life, I've paid for my mistakes   After a while, the strongest spirit breaks   I've had heartache and pain, it cut me deeper than a knife   But those days are done, 'cause you're the one I've wanted all my life      And I know very well, there's a long road to hell   That's been paved with intentions like mine   All my life, my stars were surely crossed   Now and then, I missed the love I lost   But all that changed, the day you said you'd be my wife      Who could have known that finding you   Would only take me all my life.Tell me, Catana, what heaven gave you your eyes?.Went through the attic today   Found a note you wrote packed away..Love will do you in, and love will wash you out,   And needless to say you won't stand a chance,   And you won't stand a chance."
" Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS2 that really sucked."" Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious."" @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same..I'm the boy, yeah....      How long does it last?.And this time we won't be starting over, no crying on your shoulder into the heart shaped sea..Well you're a real tough cookie with a long history   Of breaking little hearts like the one in me   That's okay, let's see how you do it   Put up you dukes, let's get down to it      Hit me with your best shot   Why don't you hit me with your best shot   Hit me with your best shot   Fire away      You come on with it, come on   You don't fight fair   That's okay, see if I care   Knock me down, it's all in vain   I get right back on my feet again      Hit me with your best shot   Why don't you hit me with your best shot   Hit me with your best shot   Fire away      Well you're a real tough cookie with a long history   Of breaking little hearts like the one in me   Before I put another notch in my lipstick case   You better make sure you put me in my place      Hit me with your best shot   C'mon, hit me with your best shot   Hit me with your best shot   Fire away      Hit me with your best shot   Why don't you hit me with your best shot   Hit me with your best shot   Fire away.Deep in the woods   Deep in the woods   Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging..I'm gonna' set your little heart on fire..Educated lady with your college degree,   Amazes me why you just can't see..Falling and spinning   Losing and winning   Keeping my head   Watching for signals   Wearisome vigil   Was I misled   I remember you said   That you don't want to forget me   It doesn't matter   Which of our fantasies fled..Now now now now now now now now   The pot is gold, the rain is rain   And the government it'll never change, no..I'm searching for a song tonight,   I'm changing all of the stations..I'm going on and on, just on and on   Just walkin', talkin', not a winner at all   I'm boozing, losing, getting out of control   She dances hip-hop, she's on the top   I'm still a fool and a half, blessed and beaten by love      Do it, do it....His mind in his whiskey   And his body in a folding chair,   Far beyond repair..(A tooth for a tooth)   Kind?.It's kind of crazy   How we are slaves to an early grave   So we get wasted   To see clearer through the haze      You gotta shake it off   Get back up   Show what you're made of   Make your own luck      And raise your heart above these streets   Put some soul under your feet   Take only what you need   Raise your heart above these streets   Mercy you mercy me      It's kinda frightening   To see how much this place has changed      You gotta shake it off   Get back up   Show what you're made of   Make your own luck      And raise your heart above these streets   Put some soul under your feet   Take only what you need   Raise your heart above these streets   Mercy you mercy me      Oh, get your head 'round what you need   Oh, get your head 'round what you feel   'Cause this is real.Did you know   That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?.It's not the way I look at her, it's the way she looks at me..Want to be with you..Who am I to judge and strike you down?.[Chorus]   Y'all came here to give it up   So come on and show me what you got   It's about to be on, baby, non-stop

that you said you would do..She's got to run, she's got to hide   She's got her head stuck in a sand dune   She never thinks, she never tries   She doesn't see that she's gonna pull through      She used to laugh, she used to cry   She used to play hot as the others   She used to fool, she used to fight   She loved a wind-up on a Saturday night      Don't you break down, dead in the water   Don't you leave town now, though you want to   Don't you break down, dead in the water   Dead in the water      He is the one, he has the smile   Keeping his cool across the dance floor   He moves around, he moves away   They move together the rest of the night      He hits the spot, she fits the bill   He tries it on, maybe she wants to   He books a room, a takeaway   Is this the answer to all of their problems?.Than to never love at all?"".Hey hey hey, hey hey hey      I'm holding on for dear life,   For just one more time around,   Hoping that you might drop by,   The next time you pass through my town..Tell her that I'm blue an' lonely   Dreamy Carolina Moon!.Forever's a lonely time and the dogs aren't always   Aren't always on my mind   'Cause I didn't free them   The scenery is burning me 'cause I'm still in it   So why don't you free me   'Cause its not my business   What he's done to me   Control is all you really need   And I can't believe it   I can't believe that   You didn't see me      Passing glances fall on me   Like screams on deaf ears   They're all laughing at me   With encouraging cheers   What he's done to me   Control is all you really need   And I can't believe it   I can't believe that   You wouldn't free me      Why don't you see me?.Hold me like you'll never let me go..Don't be afraid to fly   Spread your wings   Open up the door   So much more outside      Don't be afraid to fly   Come spread your wings   And just fly   Fly, fly, just fly, just fly   Don't be afraid   Don't let your spirit die   She said....Love comes   Love grows   every time you rise to meet me   take my hand to greet me   Love comes   Love grows   and power can give a man   much more than anybody knows      [Chorus: x2]      Before we ever met   I thought like everybody did   you were just a moron   a billion-dollar kid   You flew up all the way   like a hawk chasing a dove   I never thought that I would be   a sacrifice in love   It comes   It grows   and now we're tied together   everybody knows      [Chorus: x2]      Is stupid really stupid   or a different kind of smart?.Alligators snap at your ankles   And branches snap at your brain   If I ever get through this swamp alive   I'll nevermore pray for rain   This must be the place   And still it somehow don't seem right   Something in the moon could change   These endless days to lonely nights   I take a stroll down by the sea   And walk along the pier   Then I slip and hit my head   Now's the time to fear   I see the surface, see the rocks   See my past fly swiftly by   I feel the water in my lungs   And wake up screaming for my life   In my blue heaven   There's a bottle of Pontchartrain   Chalmette by moonlight   To take away the pain   Card sharks and blue harps   And dolphins who leap   In my blue heaven   Where I can laugh and I can weep   Black shapes zip into corners   The big lads start to crawl   To holes of their own making   In the cracks within the wall   Snakes and rats and spiders   I know that they're still there   I pray to God that I may sleep   Without a hope, without a care   In my blue heaven   There's a bottle of Pontchartrain   Chalmette by moonlight   To take away the pain   Felines and sea lions   And rain on the beach   In my blue heaven   With angels who aren't out of reach   In my blue heaven   There's a bottle of Pontchartrain   Chalmette by moonlight   To take away the pain   Nightingales sing   And the bells they will ring   In my blue heaven   The bells of Hell   Go ding a ling a ling.Nobody on the road,   Nobody on the beach..I don't know what I been livin' on but it's   Not enough to fill me up   I need more than just words can say   I need everything this life can give me   Come on baby close your eyes let go   This can be everything we've dreamed   It's not work, that makes it work no   Let the magic do the work for you      Cause something reached out and touched me   Now I see that all I want      I want the best of both worlds   And baby I know what it's worth   We can have have the best of both worlds a little   Heaven right here on earth   There's a picture in the gallery of a fallen angel   Looked a lot like you   We forget where we come from sometimes   I had a dream it was really you      Cause something reached out and touched me   Now I see that all I want      I want the best of both worlds   And baby I know what it's worth   We can have have the best of both worlds a little   Heaven right here on earth   There's a picture in the gallery of a fallen angel   Looked a lot like you   We forget where we come from sometimes   I had a dream it was really you      You don't have to die to go to heaven   Or hang around to be born again   Just tune into what this place has got to offer   Cause we may never be here again      I want the best of both worlds   And baby I know what it's worth   We can have have the best of both worlds a little   Heaven right here on earth   There's a picture in the gallery of a fallen angel   Looked a lot like you   We forget where we come from sometimes   I had a dream it was really you.Ohhh."

" A couple of months ago i was hanging out with my freind @CAPS1. It was a @DATE1 and i came to her to spend the @TIME1.At first we were extreamly bored so we went on a walk to go find something to do.We found our friend dylan at the skatepark and we stopped to talk to him for a while. After we had hung out there for about two hours we headed back up to her house.When we opened the door her sister started freaking out because we left so she got stucked with there younger brother @PERSON1. @CAPS1 didn't yell back, she didn't want the drama. Her sister got even more mad because jesssika was not showing a reaction to what her sister was doing. By ten minutes she exploded and started throwing herself around and freaking out. Me and @CAPS1 looked at each other and stated laughing really reallyhard because how funny her sister looked. @TIME1 after her mom had calmed the sistuation down, @CAPS1 and I made a @CAPS3 bed on her bedroom floor and when we were falling asleep we bothbursted out in laughter it was the funnest @TIME1 i have had in a long time.

me if I was headed to the east   I politely stepped a side and said I did not need a ride   That I'd rather take my chances with the heat   Well, when she turned and walked away   I saw my big mistake   There were jewels on her body oh-so-rare   Had it been another day I just might have rode away   With that woman riding off to God-knows-where   So the years they came and went   And found me living in a tent   Far above a little marble stream   And it may have been the light that shone out through the night   That attracted the hand scratching on my screen   When I cautiously looked out through the night   There was no doubt   That the owner of that hand was that girl   So I bid her do come in   And I'll open up a tin   If you'll tell me 'bout your trip around the world   Well, she said,""If you think back   To the first time that we passed   I'm sure you'll picture me in all my jewels   It was shortly after then that I ran into another man   And I asked him the same question I asked you   But now he he didn't refuse   And he took off of both his shoes   And climbed aboard mu east-bound caravan   In the twinkling of the night   He knocked me off the side   And left me there for dead upon the sand   And I thought I was done   Lying naked in the sun   When much to my surprise, who should pass?.Is there anything a man don't stand to lose,   When the devil wants to take it all away?.There is a lighthouse in the harbor   Giving guidance with its light   But I had no one to return to   As I wander through life   From the first time that I saw you   Standing silent by the shore   I knew my search was over   And I would look for love no more   Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone   Deep in my heart I can hear love calling   Going once, going twice, going gone   Going once, going twice, going gone   There is a ship on the horizon   Making its way against the wind   And from the place where I stand watching   I swear my ship is coming in   Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone   Deep in my heart I can hear love calling   Going once, going twice, going gone   Going once, going twice, going gone   Deep in the waters of love I am falling, sinking like a stone   Deep in my heart I can hear love calling   Going once, going twice, going gone   Going once, going twice, going gone.Hello baby, it's a long time   I know you're here   I feel you close to me   So much to say but   Making all the words   I save them all inside   Then I see you and they disappear   Like leaves beneath the snow   And life don't wait for everyone   And yesterday, I let you go      I'm watching you tonight   And I waited for so long   I've been living on your memory   In a world where we were one   And you told me you could make it on your own      I'm watching you tonight   And it's making me cry   When I lost you, I lost everything   But our love should never die   Not mine, my love is born to be your love   Oh baby   To make history near you   But the moment when I see me in your eyes   You're gone, you're gone      You can say goodbye if you want to   I love you but I'll try to understand   But in my soul I know it's meant to be   Together you and me      But I know you came to fade away   Like voices in the wind   And I wonder if you feel my love   It's stronger than it's ever been      I'm watching you tonight   And there's no other one   All the love we gave eternally   Now it's dying in the sun   Not mine, my love was born to be your love   Oh baby   To make history near you   But that moment when I see me in your eyes   You're gone, you're gone, you're gone.Well, well..Feed you with a kiss      Am I the queen up your sleeve   When you got no ace   Am I a slap in your face   Am I a thought in your head   That I keep away from you   Cause it frightens me      But you   Gotta step away from it   Step away from all of it   Gotta step away from it   Step away from all of this shit.So I laugh in your face..Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,   And let your Daddy lift it..All:   You are... Wicked awesome!...And Aubrey was her name..Love comes to everyone some are weak some strong   I'm not strong today   They've took her back, brought the curtain down   What can I do now, I'm afraid to think about it..I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the   Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the   Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes, I'm goin' to the   Hardware store      I'm goin' (yes I'm) goin', I'm a-goin' to the   Goin' to the (hard) ware I'm goin', really goin' to the   Goin' (hard) I'm goin' to the (hard) oh yes, I'm goin' to the   Hardware store      Would you look at all that stuff ....It's better than I ever knew      Meet me in outer space   I will hold you close   If you're afraid of heights   I need you to see this place   It might be the only way   That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you      How do you do it?"
" Laughter is just one of those things that doesn't go away very easy. The simplest things can make you laugh or smile the point is happiness is going to be around for a while. My dad laughs, my mom laughs I laugh everybody laughs its a good thing to have. If there was nothing on what to be happy on then people would be in fights and country's in wars. Anger is not something someone wants to deal with all the time; you have to relax every now and then.  My parents and I know that happiness is what drives us to good things. That's why we embrace it in our house we like to acknowledge it to my younger siblings. My dad and me have a good relationship as well with my mom we get along well and laugh together.  Me and my girlfriend @LOCATION1; we started out in a good relationship but as time went on it was starting to fade. We weren't communicating as well and that's what was driving us apart. We were just ending up in fights all the time and for no reason fighting just seemed to find us all the time. We talked we hung out and we started getting along better laughing at our joke or our constant teasing to one another. We had a good time she said that she liked us laughing and having a good time. I told her that laughing and enjoying ourselves is what brought us together. Laughing is the key to our happiness its what made me and her closer its a main key point to any relationship.  If there is no happiness then there is no laughter, and if there is no laughter then how are you suppose to get happiness. They work together and its a good thing to have in life where would we be if we didn't have it. We would all have a grudge and for no reason to have one and just live in black and white all the time..You're the anchor that holds me down   When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown      Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums   To see what a lady looks like   So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight   If you spot one, good sir, treat her right   This is Benjamin Andre signing off   Thanks a million   Good luck and goodnight..What is love?.What?.I meen the cat is really insecure A little bit   So the call girls groupies and they call girls this..You are my hiding place   I run to You   I need Your mercy and grace   To see me through   So I'll run to You      You are my hiding place   I run to You   I need Your mercy and grace   To see me through   So I'll run to You      You are my strength Oh God   You will uphold me   You are my shield Oh God   You will protect me      You are my strength oh God   You will uphold me   You are my shield oh God   You will protect me      You are my hiding place   I run to You   I need Your mercy and grace   To see me through   So I'll run to You      You are my strength Oh God   You will uphold me   You are my shield Oh God   You will protect me      You are my strength oh God   You will uphold me   You are my shield oh God   You will protect me      You are my hiding place   And run to You   And I need Your mercy and grace   To see me through   So I'll run to You   So I'll run to You   I'll run to You.Ebony, don't walk out on me..My!.Si, si, mi muchachito,   She'd love to sing it too if only she knew the way..All our days are numbered   Some live on borrowed time   But life is what you make it   Thank God I was so inclined   To accept my Lord and Savior   When the good news sunk in   He paid a heavenly price   By giving His life   And I can't wait to go home to Him      I'm ready to go that distance   And God only knows when that might be   But oh, what joy waits up yonder   Once this old world sets me free      When there's no tomorrow   And glory has come down   Those without Jesus   Are lost and never to be found   So please listen when I'm talking   I'm just saying what needs to be said   Make plans while your still living   It's too late when your dead      I'm ready to go that distance   And God only knows when that might be   But oh, what joy waits up yonder   Once this old world sets me free      Oh, once this old world sets me free.And whats   to do?.Sen sen sen sen sen sen on,   Sen on and never hang on, sen on..I can promise you tomorrow,   But I can't buy back yesterday..I am burning for you..And I don't want to be left holding the bag for them      'Scuze me for living but I have to say,   I've got some worries of my own, like staying fat.It's the feel of your blood   As it flows smoothly down my skin   Intoxicating my soul   Immortality, seducing me      Burning in your own hell, which now binds you to me infinitely   Spirits of angels don't weep for you enticing me   Vanity, blood   Left for you to drink      Eternity waits for you   Vanity, blood   Left for you to drink   Eternity waits for you to drink      Frozen in time is the ice flowing in your veins   Are you insane?.For as long as I remember   Ever since I was a child   I've had the understanding in my heart   That there is a Creator, a Master of design   Who hung the moon and every single star   But the greatest revelation that I could ever know   He loves me in my weakness   And calls me His own   [Chorus:]   I have a hope, and I believe   My faith is alive, my spirit is free   Though He's unseen, still I know deep within my soul   There is a God   In the arms of human nature   I've fallen on the way   He's heard the desperation of my cry   Oh, one drink of living water, can heal the hurt inside   He fills my cup, it never will run dry   For the price of my redemption is covered by the blood   And I have been made worthy   By His gift of love   [Chorus:]   Father of Light   He never changes, He never fails   Giver of grace, author of life   He paid the price, so I can say   I have a hope, and I believe   My faith is alive, He's living in me   There is a God   I do believe, I do believe   [Chorus:]   There is a God   He's the way, the truth, the life   There is a God   His name is Jesus.I'm taken back in disbelief   Is this really me, ha, in the mirror I see   Staring back at me?.Be honest with yourself..But in the end you see,   You took the best of me..Let me out   Sorry son   Commit a crime, pay the price      Death row, What's that 'No stay?'.You can't hold me!).Finders keepers, losers weepers, baby   If I could get the lid off, I'd look into the jar   Is this the best thing that I can do?.I heard it from the gangster   I heard it from the priest   I heard it from my best friend   Way down in the middle east      Have a nice day..(A.

" A few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat and it jumped about two feet into the air, Once again we started laughing really hard but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1 my dad my bother and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did. He flipped the switch and next thing i know i was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4-able to free himself from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues, i tried it first and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result to all these great funny times we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away , and @PERSON1 moved. In better words funny times @MONTH1 be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces.. .You force me into situations,   Preach bad of sin and fornication,   Forget your sworded celebration,   My heart fills up with rage   Who are you to gauge,   The purpose of my world's creation..Chorus:   When you need it call me on the phone tonight   It's on, it's on, it's on   Body's callin vibrate in reggaeton   It's on, it's on      ... like a drive....Norm life baby   ""I'm just a sample of a soul   Made to look just like a human being."".You go see weezy for the wordplay,   Jeezy for the bird play,   Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy,   All my verses picture perfect   And they meant to serve a purpose,   You aint living what you kicking and you worthless,   Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous,   Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it,   Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical, last thing I'm worried bout is what another rapper do,   Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off blast off and have outstanding qualities,   Sell alotta records I respect and salute that,   But spitting real life on hot beats....Longing to possess you oh so dearly   I'm obsessed by you completely   I'll go mad if I can't have you   I can't let you pass me by   I just can't let you go   But I know that I am much too shy   To let you know   Afraid that I might say the wrong words   And displease you   Afraid for love to fade   Before it can come true   (instrumental)   I can't let you pass me by   I just can't let you go   Let me say the things and say the words   To let you know   I would rather say the awkward words   Than lose you   Or for love to fade   Before it can come true.I want what I wanted   Oh, what a fool believes   I got her in my sight, but   Just out of reach, oh-oh   Here we go around, (round, round, round)   Run-run-runaround, yeah!.I don't care what these commentators say   I swear I don't care   For what difference do they make?.I can't get to sleep   I think about the implications   Of diving in too deep   And possibly the complications      Especially at night   I worry over situations   I know will be alright   Perhaps it's just imagination      [Chorus]   Day after day it reappears   Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear   Ghosts appear and fade away      Alone between the sheets   Only brings exasperation   It's time to walk the streets   Smell the desperation      At least there's pretty lights   And though there's little variation   It nullifies the night   From overkill      [Chorus]      I can't get to sleep   I think about the implications   Of diving in too deep   And possibly the complications      Especially at night   I worry over situation   I know will be alright   It's just overkill      [Chorus].I know I've let you down (oh babe...)

through   Of pieces of heaven I promised you   It wasn't paradise, it wasn't even close   And I hurt the one I love the most   And sorry could never be good enough   But I will make it up to you....Blizzard in the air, Winter's bitter love affair,   I grab my coat again, hat on my head, lit my jack and I was off again she said,   Rising up early that sun rose barely before me, I could have sworn I just laid my head to bed..Now we know just how to behave   Since chivalry decided to bathe      And as the skirts we wore were increasingly high   Till the hem was just a cloud in the sky

"                                  The @CAPS1 of Laughter  @CAPS2 would we be without laughter? Would we still have relationships/friendships like we do @CAPS5? Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  ""@CAPS3 @PERSON5,"" I began, ""@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement. ""@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!"" @CAPS6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS17 camera.  We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. @CAPS12 was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS10 the mall?  ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11,"" @CAPS12 screamed. ""@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13, and @CAPS14're @CAPS9? He's never going to talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!""  ""@CAPS14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS14 know it,"" chimed @PERSON2. ""@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14 pretty good, huh?"" ""@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,"" I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up @CAPS9, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS12 was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut @CAPS1 that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS14 have any experiences @CAPS2 laughter brought @CAPS14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?    .I can smile on a warm summer day   I can laugh, I can listen to the children play   But I'm going to miss the killer with the kiss   He was a friend of mine   Now is the time, now is the time   It?s going to rain, hope it don't rain on you   There's going to be a lot of pain before this thing is through   If Jesus was alive, he'd be standing on the M5   Holding up a neon sign screaming   Now is the time, now is the time   Now is the time, so many people can't see   They think that love is blind but it ain't free   There's a line, so many people have crossed and now   Their love is lost, say, ""Goodbye"", my funny valentine   Now is the time, now is the time   Now is the time, now is the time   I can run just as far as my eyes can see   And I'm free, yeah, just as free as I want to be   But I won't ever forget that crazy little planet   He was a friend of mine   Now is the time, now is the time   Now is the time, now is the time   Now is the time, now is the time   Now is the time.Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you   You

"                                  ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good..I GO TO THE ROCK   Writer Dottie RMBO   I go to the rock   Where do I go,   When there's nobody else to turn to   Who do I talk

"                              The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When im with my family, we all have such a great time together that we laugh all the time at things or memories we say we remember. While we are all gathered around the table whether it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner we always have something fun to say and laugh about all the time. To begin with, during breakfast @DATE2 @TIME1, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME1, but suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a banana lying on the floor, when her manager went by she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall. It was impossible not to laugh about it becuase it was the manager. Well that @TIME1 was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said ""@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happend, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and coutches trying to get dried off"" I couldn't believe it and I starting laughing so hard that I had to tell my freinds that were next to me and them too starting laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school, but even though it was something good to laugh at I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told eachother about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his freinds were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of tiolet paper stuck to his pants. I immediatley thought he would have gotten embarrased but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying their cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldnt be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE1 third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enojoyed and had fun laughing with eachother telling about funny things that happen to us during our day..Black Phantom, triple black, with the oak wood   Gucci shoes, that's how I play      Hold up, I don't gamble, I don't play no craps   I was taught early on don't jeopardize the stacks   Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts   I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks   I'm affiliated with too many hot cats   To end up, crawlin' out of a hole in Iraq   Try to topple my regime   You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen   Is there a medic on the scene?.The rain won't stop falling,   It's harder than before   This car keeps on stalling,   Pedal to the floor      And what I need to know is if you love me, and I   Really need to know is if you want me when you call   If you want me when you call      We were young and we were foolish   Schoolbooks in our arms   Dodging homework, dodging classes   To set off fire alarms      And what I need to know is if you love me, and I   Really need to know if you need me when you call   If you want me when you call      We are waving our lives away   We are waving our lives away   We are waving our lives away   We are waving our lives away      And what I need to know is if you love me, and I   Really need to know if you need me when you call   And what I need to know is if you love me, and I   Really need to know if you need me when you call      And what I need to know is if you love me, and I   Really need to know if you need me when you call   If you want me when you call.So get used to it   Get used to it!.Get your rocks off-a me!

" Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last @DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small @CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our @ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. @CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. @CAPS8 opened the hearts of the @CAPS5 children so that they @MONTH1 hear the word of @CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON1 was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, ""@CAPS9"". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is ""@PERSON2"". Apparently, @PERSON2's friends spotted @PERSON1 first and told @PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know @CAPS2 @MONTH1 hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects @CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter"" would we?.See that little jersey girl in the see-through top, with the peddle pushers   Sucking on a soda pop,

" Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. The implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends. It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. I personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my father's side of the family. One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time. Laughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my father's entire family, and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it. Being that they are scattered across @LOCATION2, and very few live in the vicinity of @LOCATION1, visiting with these family members is a rare occasion. The most admirable quality of my father's side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well. Just @DATE1 my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in @DATE2. This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members. Not only was I to be the only guy there, but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year. Although we had always enjoyed eachother's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities. The day of my sister's baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat. Within ten minutes of doing so, my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. However nervous I had been, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower. For the duration of the party, all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts, or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically. on this specific day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt..There's no goodbye,   There's no goodbye,   There's no goodbye between us..Ooh ooh, sometimes this life's unkind..Maybe I'm just a ghost   Disappear when anybody's close   Go through you when you try to hold   Try to hold me near      Maybe I'm just a ghost   Emptier than anybody

alive   That's the only way, I say,   That love survives   Its time we try      Chorus:   Loraine   Won't you show the way   Hearts that bend won't break   When they learn to face the truth now   Show me how      Loraine   I know you feel the same   Hold me now   I don't know what to say   I'm so in love with you   Loraine      Talk to me   Isn't that the way it ought to be?.All my girls still

"  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless! .Ov'??....Do I have to come right out   And ask you to be mine?.Think you're pure in heart?.Listen in....Send the mayor down in his pickup truck..I got jet lag   And livin' out an overnight bag   Time changes every day   They do things a different way   Back in the U.S.A.      Tryin' hard to make a phone call   ""Long distance over seas""   ""Yes ma'am I did say Scotland""   ""Could you spell that again for me please""      You know that it just blew my mind   I'd love to go back there next trip   I sure hope we get some time..""Sure God's all powerful, but does he have lips?.Yeah(3x)      I'll sing a song to you, my friend..Eat your heart out baby   Oh, won't you get

swear to only one      Time moves quickly as the years go by   All these moments slip away   When I'm gone and life will carry on   You will know someway      I Will Be There   I Will Be There   I

" Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2 , and @CAPS3. On my birthday the whole @CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the @DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. Then on the @DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS2. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS3! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad ""A laugh a day will keep the @CAPS10 at @LOCATION1""..(Right to your heart)   Can you hear me?.[Taylor Swift]   I use to think that love was for dreamers,   ""Love at first sight"" I never believed it,   Had my head on tight, I lived in the real world,   But that was until I met you..When hot gets a little cold..Yeah, the cradle will rock..Pas la peine de changer trop...

"               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought""@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.""I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,""@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there. .It's been a couple years   Guess it's not about who you know, it's just how you balance it   It's always awkward to... a nigga artist   And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest   It's how you start actin when nobody can reach ya   My plan just hatched, happy easter   I'm doin it big   Look at what I done   Look at where I'm is   It's only just begun   Cause I was stayin home   When they was havin fun   So please don't be surprised when they announce that I won   And this is how my speech goes   I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit   That's all I got to say   At the top is where I stay   And tell my haters never go away, the winner   Uhh, ok I do it for the love   Bunk bed flow, always one level above   If I'm in ya startin five you will never need a sub   And I'm neva lookin down so I always know wassup..I guess I'm just a lucky so and so      The birds in every tree   Are all so neighborly..Popeil.).Open my eyes, blind me with your light now   And your lies..Who's gonna bitta the fifty five dollar   Bill?.He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die."".No way, Jose!"".Watching all of history repeat itself, time after time..We all should do the ring-around-a-rosy rag.Brand   It didn't take him long to get his little bag of tools..I'm too tired to deceive you   We can't pretend there's nothing wrong   Who'll be first to say it?.Just like a buzzin' fly   I come into your life   Now I float away   Like honey in the sun   Was it right or wrong   I couldn't sing that song anyway      Oh, but darlin'   Now I remember   How the sun shown down   And how it warmed your prayin' smile   When all the love was there      You're the one I talk about   You're the one I think about   Everywhere I go   And sometimes honey   In the mornin'   Lord, I miss you so      That's how I know I found a home   That's how I know I found a home      Oh, hear the mountains singing   Lord, I can hear them ringing, darlin',   Out your name   And tell me if you know   Just how the river flows   Down to the sea      Now I want to know   Everything about you   I want to know   Everything about you      What makes ya smile   What makes ya wild   What makes ya love me this way   Darlin' I want to know   Darlin' I want to know      You're the one I talk about   You're the one I think about   Everywhere I go   And sometimes honey   In the mornin'   Lord, I miss you so      That's how I know I found a home   That's how I know I found a home      A-walkin' hand in hand   And all along the sand   A seabird knew your name   He knew your love was growin'   Lord, I think it knows it's flowin'   through you and me      Ah, tell me darlin'   When I should leave you,   Ah, tell me darlin'   I don't want to grieve you....

"                The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the of day of @DATE1, I was turning @NUM1 years old and me and my best friend were at home, I called him seeing what he has planed for this nice sunny day and he told me he had nothing in mind, so we kept trying to think of something but for @NUM2 hours we had no luck. I called him again and we met up at a grade school and just sat down @CAPS3 a bench and started calling people to see whats up with everyone and no one would answer there phones. It became about @NUM3 pm when we stopped calling people to make planes, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat, I told him sure since we had no luck for a whole @DATE2 @TIME1. What sucks was that it was the @DATE2 of the @DATE3, and school was going to begin @CAPS3 @DATE4. So while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see whats up and whats happening.  We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty good, till we started hearing music bumping from a distance, so we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he told me he's going to go pick up lights for a @ORGANIZATION1 and I asked him who's all there and he told me that I need to see for my self. So we walked around the corner of the street we were @CAPS3 and saw the @ORGANIZATION1, we walked up to the door and saw are other friend who was standing at the door, we asked him where is everyone, we been bored all day with nothing to do @CAPS3 my own @CAPS1 and he told me that were here now and that's all that matters, so we walked in and saw everyone we called @DATE5 and more and they screamed @CAPS5 @CAPS1 to me and I was shocked why this @ORGANIZATION1 is for me and how did I get to my own @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 accident. I finally found out that it was planed for me the whole time, I guess that the flier by the restaraunt was put there @CAPS3 purpose and my friend was @CAPS3 this little @CAPS2 to get me to the @ORGANIZATION1 and it was all planed from the beginning of the day for people not to answer my calls or my friends but to get me to go buy some food and to find the flier and get me to go to my own @ORGANIZATION1 and I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get food to find my own @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 flier and we all had a good laugh, The @CAPS8!.Let me flow into the ocean,

"                                       @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 wants to travel, and while traveling is fun, it is more exciting to go with people you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with people you @MONTH1 not know very well. Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 has an opportunity to go on a trip together. During these trips, the students are able to work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and just have a great time together. It's a experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of. At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION2. I was ecstatic to be going, but I'm an extremely introverted person and I knew that I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk, and was scared I would be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they would go across a street corner that didn't have a @CAPS5 dip down into the street, and thousands of other things that were racing through my mind. I was so terrified that that I would be separated from @PERSON3, my one friend who was in choir, that I almost didn't go. I'm not really sure how, but my mother convinced me that everything would be alright, and I had nothing to fear. Once we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split up into groups to see who wanted to go to explore the @PERSON7 and who wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true, I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I just kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I got on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @PERSON4, came to sit by me, and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we arrived at the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street we split yet again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to ride in one of the old trolleys up to the top then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep. I was forced to go on the trolley because the hill was so steep part of the sidewalk contained steps, and since I can't walk, the only alternative was the trolly. Several of the other kids went with us and once again @PERSON4 was in my group. A couple hours later, after getting lost and turning on several wrong streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid conversing with @PERSON4 this whole time, so the ride up the hill was enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be riding on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 on our ride.  There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperons, @PERSON6, and @PERSON5 raced back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me, alone, with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, who was the remaining chaperon. We walked leasiurly down the hill, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every so often they would ask me a question and I would answer in as few words as possible, and that's what was going on when we walked past a group of men, arguing, in front of a store and one of them yelled, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?"" We didn't really know who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we just kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block @PERSON4 and I simultaneously broke into laughter. The man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses that I should have said to the man, each one being more hilarious than the last one, and as conversations go, we eventually got on different topics, which made me realize that @PERSON4 and I really did have many similar traits. We both loved musicals, we both enjoy reading, and we both have annoying, younger brothers. Ever since that day, @PERSON4 and I have been fairly good friends, all because we took a moment to laughed together..Baby when they look up at the sky   We'll be shooting stars just passing by   You'll be coming home with me tonight   We'll be burning up like neon lights      Be still my heart 'cause it's freaking out, it's freaking out, right now   Shining like stars 'cause we're beautiful,

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain   Walking hand in hand with the one I love   Oo, how I love the rainy days   And the happy ways I feel inside      After a while we run under a tree   I turn to him and he kisses me   There with the beat of the rain on the leaves   Softly he breathes and I close my eyes   Sharing our love under stormy skies      Oo, I hear laughter in the rain   Walking hand in hand with the one I love   Oo, how I love the rainy days   And the happy ways I feel inside      [Break]      I feel the warmth of his hand in mine      Oo, I hear laughter in the rain   Walking hand in

wrinkled in my hand   ""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes   I remember the night we walked along the Seine   Riding on the Metro      I remember a feeling coming over me   The soldier turned, then walked away   Fuck you for loving me   Riding on the Metro.You lost your best opportunity   You passed up a prize   For some pie in the sky.I don't need a perfect lover to hold me in the rain   Someone to ease my pain when I feel blue   If I lost you to another, think I'd drown out here for sure   Won't you stay with me and be my only cure?.Oh Daddy,   If I could make you see,   If there's been a fool around,   It's got to be me..Ooh -   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!.Take me away   You think I can't, fool?.There may be someone else for me,   You're not the only man..Tattoo on your waistline..Let every heart prepare him room,   And heaven and nature sing (and heaven and nature sing!).Daaa...da ba da dah-dat dah..?.Navigator, navigator rise up and be strong   The morning is here and there's work to be done..oh!.[Chorus]   I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama   I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama   I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama   When you're gon' get your act together?.I was so high, I did not recognize   The fire burning in her eyes   The chaos that controlled my mind   Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane   Never to return again   But always in my heart      [Chorus]   This love has taken it's toll on me   She said goodbye too many times before   And her heart is breaking in front of me   I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore      I tried my best to feed her appetite   Keep her coming every night   So hard to keep her satisfied   Kept playing love like it was just a game   Pretending to feel the same   Then turn around and leave again      [Chorus]      I'll fix these broken things   Repair your broken wings   And make sure everything is alright   My pressure on your hips   Sinking my fingertips   Into every inch of you   'Cause I know that's what you want me to do      [Chorus].There was a shot in the dark   I was caught by surprise   There was a hole in my heart   There were tears in your eyes   And there was nothing to say   'Cause you made up your mind   And so I guess what you meant   When you left was goodbye      So if you're gonna go   And leave me in a lonely gray   I won't let it show   Until you finally float away      You gotta know that you tear me up   When you say you wanna take it all away, take it all away   You tear it up when you say   You wanna take it all away, take it all away!.Son, I'm 30   I only went with your mother 'cause she's dirty   And I don't have a decent bone in me   What you get is just what you see yeah   I see it so I take it freely   And all

time building up these walls   Then you come strutting in with your wrecking ball      Just another girl defeated   Til' you gimme what I needed      Something I can feel   Something I can feel deep

"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE1, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE2 time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was sweet, @CAPS2 I though, until one @DATE2 day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" @CAPS2 me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS2 as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughing has helped me a lot in life because it brings me up when I am feeling down..I took   You don't give me the same love   And when I ask you, you say everything is okay   Well I'm not feeling the love no more   And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere   Well I'm not feeling the love no more   Tell me how where we go wrong      Feels like I'm living all alone in this old house   Cause you're distance brings the worst of you   It's like a battle of silence... for   Cause it seems I'm just a ghost to you      [Chorus]      I remember we used to make love through the night   And we we're doing it 'til the morning light   Put you are not there      [Repeat x2]   Well I'm not feeling the love no more   And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere   Well I'm not feeling the love no more   Tell me how where we go wrong.You know just how to hurt me as you often do   You start flirtin' in public with somebody new   You start trouble in private when nobody knows   Oh then you go away smellin' just like a rose   Though you make me act like a fool   You treat mean and cold and cruel   You make me do things that I hate to do   Oh but why do you make, oh why do I let you   Make me look like a fool?.We all want to believe in love,      We all want to believe in something,      Bigger than just us!.The scars of your love, remind me of us..So give your love to the birds,   Speaking of four-letter words..To think his niece would be a bride, Uh-huh..Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me,   From marching down freedom's road..I thought so      No, nothing will stop it   You can waste your time   Yeah, you feel desire   You made up your mind      Pre - chorus:   Feel it   Taste the victory   Feel it burning   Burning inside of me      Chorus:   Right now (Hey!).Bang you're dead   It's not a game I'm gonna play with you      Did you think I'm high and dry?.You can see all the stars as you walk along hollywood boulevard,   Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,   People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,   Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain....If ever a pair of eyes promised paradise   Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me blue   Jezebel, it was you      If ever the devil's plan was made to torment man   It was you, Jezebel, it was you, night and day, every way   Jezebel, Jezebel, Jezebel!.Not everyone knows how sweet your kiss is   Not everyone knows how warm your hand is   How soft your lips are and when you like to take your time   How sweet your love flows not everyone knows   [ piano ]   Not everyone knows what your favorite song is   Not everyone knows what your idea of wrong is   The things that you laugh at and the things that make you cry   Your highs and your lows not everyone knows   What's everybody sayin' doesn't matter to much the best part of love doesn't show   The feelin' we feel when we touch is such we're the only ones who should know   What's between you and me is ours together   It's easy and free and keeps gettin' better   We're not tryin' to hide no anything no everything shows   What makes it grow not everyone knows   Not everyone knows your highs and your lows not everyone knows   Not everyone knows.What will you do now the bridges have been burned?.The spirit of Fatima still rules the Earth   She knows your future, she knows what it's worth   Sister Fatima has God-given powers   And on 42nd Street a shop that sells flowers   Is her palace, come and be healed      She knows all your business, your health and your ills   She'll counsel your weddings, divorces and wills   For full restoration five dollars an hour   And with each consultation a free holy flower   And if she likes you, well you can have two      And I came from nowhere like you and your friend   My searching and wandering went on without end   My future was dim, my spirit was crushed   In one sacred moment my questions were hushed      I'm a servant of fate in this garden of truth   A humble recruit of the taffeta booth   Where all things are known but few are revealed   Where sins are forgotten and sickness is healed   For five dollars the flower is free.And must I now begin to doubt   Who never doubted all these years?.I got a hot rod ford and a two dollar bill   And I know a spot right over the hill   There's soda pop and the dancin's free   So if you want to have fun come along with me..Now kids hang on just a second before we start   You know there's a reason we are all here in front of Grandma and   Grandpa's   Christmas tree   And if Trevor and E.

" It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON3!"" We heard @PERSON2 scream as @PERSON1 and I walked into my room. ""@CAPS1 boy."" I thought, ""@CAPS3 we @CAPS7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS3 at the same time."" @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS28 head.  ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 happened this time?"" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS7 at each other the way @CAPS29 were. ""@CAPS4!"" I finally yell. ""@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're going to do. You,"" I pointed to @PERSON3, ""@CAPS7 and sit over there."" @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, @CAPS29 nodded in response. ""@CAPS9, @CAPS14 lets @CAPS7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. ""@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 just a comical genius?"" @PERSON2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 said laughing. ""@CAPS14 who's calling who crazy?"" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON2 had on @CAPS28 game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON1 and whispered, ""@CAPS1 this is not going to be pretty."" We started preparing for the worst. ""@CAPS17 grab @PERSON3's arm and drag @CAPS28 if you have to, out of this room."" @PERSON1 jumped to @CAPS28 feet and got @PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 to my bed. When @CAPS29 had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS28 up but kept myself between @CAPS28 and the door. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 is going on with you two?"" I nervously asked @CAPS28.  @PERSON2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before."" @CAPS20 started flowing down @CAPS28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  ""I...I don't know @CAPS22 h..happened."" @PERSON3 said still weeping. ""I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha..happened today."" @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS22 happened that we missed.  ""@CAPS22 did you mean when you said @CAPS22 happened today?"" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS15 @CAPS28 response. ""@CAPS23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?"" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. ""@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3."" All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @PERSON3. ""@CAPS4, this is pointless. @CAPS23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS29 just make things more complicated anyway."" I looked to both of them, @CAPS20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. ""@CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget?"" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. ""I'm @CAPS23 sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?"" @CAPS28 face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 to reply. ""Of course I forgive you."" @CAPS29 hugged with @CAPS20 still streaming down their faces.

your footsteps on the stairs   Still recall the images that   Seem to live out there   Like a train passing in the distance   Black bird in flight I hear you call   And even though there's no one   Dark shadows move across the wall   I still hear the sound of   Conversations from the hall   Look to see who's coming   But it's nothing and there's no one there at all   No one there at all, no one

"                Twins For a @CAPS1  Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially the laughs that make your stomach feel like its going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's @CAPS23 I surround myself with people that are like me, that's my best friend @PERSON1 and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together @CAPS24's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter. The best part of our friendship is that we are alike I think, and we use @CAPS24 to our advantage. One @CAPS1 @PERSON1 and I were taking a stroll downtown. We were just window shopping,when we past a clothing store that had on display a auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. @PERSON1 and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me.When I turned to @PERSON1 and said "" @PERSON2? (her nickname) @CAPS2 if I was you and you were me when we @CAPS14 meet @CAPS3 later?"". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like @CAPS24 was @CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we deiced that showing a little neck wouldn't be to bad, @CAPS7 we just threw our hair up in buns and called @CAPS24 good. As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous ""@CAPS5, kinda"" @CAPS24 was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone.  We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting @CAPS3. when we were close to the lawn of the library @PERSON1 turned to me and said ""hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!""@CAPS7 I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello, he asked where I was and she said ""I do not know actually""while she dug in her bag, ""but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put."" ""@CAPS8"" he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said ""@CAPS9 I am!"" he was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road, he jumped a little, and I said ""@CAPS10 did I scare you?"" in an little school girl voice, and he replied ""@CAPS5, of course not! A man does not get scared."" I just rolled my eyes and him and said ""I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes"". He was apprehensive at first but he did as I @NUM1 had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did. When they were face to face @PERSON1 shouted ""@CAPS9 @CAPS13 @CAPS14!"" and @CAPS3 nearly jumped to the moon. @PERSON1 and I were laughing @CAPS7 hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. @CAPS3 in confusion whipped his head between @PERSON1 and I, and said ""@CAPS16 this is interesting"" we continued laughing like buffoons, and @CAPS3 even giggled a little. He told us ""@CAPS18't you two ever do this again!"" and I said ""@CAPS19! We basically are sisters @CAPS7 @CAPS23 not play the part?"" he just glared at me in discontent and @PERSON1 rolled her eyes and said ""@CAPS2? Did the man get scared?"". We both cracked up again and @CAPS3 just smiled cause he knew we were playing around. @CAPS24 was just a blast after that, @PERSON1 and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got @CAPS3 to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When @CAPS24 was time to @CAPS14, we ventured to the parking lot where @PERSON1's mother was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we got in and asked ""@CAPS23 are you two wearing the same @NUM2 and I just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied ""@CAPS24's a long story"". @CAPS24 was the perfect end to an amazing @CAPS1 being my best friend..Father never lies, my father never lies   My father never lies   So don't be feelin' this way boy!.We're talking all the time..And everyone's a victim!.(Ruby, Ruby, hey, Miss Ruby.).Snappy Kakkie!.You must be daddy's little pumpkin   I can tell by the way you roll   You must be daddy's little pumpkin   I can tell by the way you roll   Why it's quarter past eleven   And you're sleeping on the bedroom floor      I can see the fire burning   Burning right behind your eyes   I can see the fire burning   Burning right behind your eyes   You must of swallowed a candle   Or some other kind of surprise      I'm going down to Memphis   I got three hundred dollars in cash   I'm going down to Memphis   I got three hundred dollars in cash   All the women in Memphis   Want to see how long my money will last      I'm going downtown   I'm gonna to rattle somebody's cage      I'm going downtown   I'm gonna rattle somebody's cage   I'm gonna beat on my guitar   And strut all around the stage      If you see my baby coming   Don't tell her that her daddy's in jail   If you see my baby coming   Don't you tell her that her daddy's in jail   She'd sell her little pumpkin just to raise   Her sweet daddy's bail      You must be daddy's little pumpkin   I can tell by the way you roll   You must be daddy's little pumpkin   I can tell by the way you roll   You never do nothing   To save your doggone soul..So that we can go together..Surrender your cloth and collar priest   There's no need for your beliefs in war   This is a place for heathens   Into that darkness fires illuminate      Grotesquely swollen by the heat   A half-burned corpse hanging naked   A stream is poisoned by the dead   In the ghostly light, debris of war      Lead us to the brink of extinction   The time has come for you now to finish it      What has man become a funeral pyre   Now that judgment's near, prepare to die   Need to suffer, lust for power   Mindless hunger never win   Final six is here, the cycle ends      I have come for you, my child   And the gift I bring is murder   Sumerian death in eastern winds   Face the father of your terror      Godless warheads wait to breathe   Set their sights on history   Distant silhouettes of the dead   Blacken face screams through the ashes      Lead us to the brink of extinction   The time has come for you now to finish it      What has man become a funeral pyre   Now that judgment's near, prepare to die   Need to suffer, lust for power   Mindless hunger never win   Final six is here, the cycle ends      Mankind owes his pain to hell   As he brings the end upon himself   Arms rising from the ashes   In the ghastly light of human flares      Berith soldiers capture souls   Shadows of human sacrifice   The return of everything that's dead   A cryptic promise from the heavens      Lead us to the brink of extinction   The time has come for you now to finish it      Dead flowers for a faceless dead   A city engulfed by the smell of the death   Bodies piled beneath the mist   Walking dead among the living      The world will bleed while horseman ride   Now that God has wept for Judas   Days are numbered, find your grave   Forever trying to escape to hell.And when the broken hearted people   Living in the world agree,   There will be an answer, let it be..You just gotta walk on both sides of the line   You've thrilled at the thought of each stranger's arms you find   Everything that's yours to hold just can't satisfy your mind   'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line   If you had me in a mansion filled with gold   If I lay at your feet my heart and my soul   You'd still crave the grapes on your next door neighbor's vine   'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line      You just gotta walk...   'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line.I don't believe in an interventionist god   But I know, darling, that you do   But if I did I would kneel down and ask him   Not to intervene when it came to you   Not to touch a hair on your head   To leave you as you are   And if he felt he had to direct you   Then direct you into my arms      Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms      And I don't believe in the existence of angels   But looking at you I wonder if that's true   But if I did I would summon them together   And ask them to watch over you   To each burn a candle for you   To make bright and clear your path   And to walk, like christ, in grace and love   And guide you into my arms      Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms      And I believe in love   And I know that you do too   And I believe in some kind of path   That we can walk down, me and you   So keep your candlew burning   And make her journey bright and pure   That she will keep returning   Always and evermore      Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms, o lord   Into my arms.Now look here, baby,

it must be fun   To be dancin' in the clear moonlight   Otherwise, would everyone be out on   Such a cold and windy night?.And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,   And everything will bring a chain of love..In the summer that you came   There was something eating everyone   And the sunshine fund was low   We couldn't greet you   With a simple hello   and the watchers of the flood   Were busy in their chambers   Making sure there was new blood   To sustain their dying veins   but I believed you   No need for further questioning   I'm gonna leave with you   You can teach me all you know   Which way will we go now   On our trip to taller windows   I really don't know now   I really don't know   in the winter that you left   There was business as usual   With the same old fears and frustrations   But the word got out   It was really such a pity   but the judges and the saints   And the textbook committee   Decided you should be left out   Not even mentioned   but I believed you   No need for further questioning   I'm gonna leave with you   You can teach me all you know   Which way will we go now   On our trip to taller windows   I really don't know now   I really don't know.How long was I sleeping?.I really should just get out more these days..And you can keep all that junk to yourself..Don't look back,   Live your life,   Even if it's only for tonight""   I said, ""Hey, it's alright   If it makes you feel alive""      We got to live before we get older   Do what we like   We got nothing to lose   Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders   Oh, we got nothing to prove      I said, ""Hey, it's alright   Does it make you feel alive?.Spent alone.Boast Battle!.It's a lot for you..A million sweet memoriers..I told you from the start I couldn't give you my heart it belonged to someone else   I tried like hell but still we fell I guess we could not help ourselves   You sure felt good in my world little girl but it's time to draw the line   Cause there's a lady who's mine and she's not the kind to just die upon the vine   Rose knows something's going on Rose knows she's spending too much time alone   I suppose better get myself back home Rose knows something's going on      I'd love to stay here and lay down with you dear and hold you one more time   I wish it could be but unfortunately I've got roses on my mind   Rose knows something's going on   Rose knows something's going on.and he's so small   How did I get stuck in this shit hole?.All because she danced   while his fiddle tuned..Everybody just wants to go back home..Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day..I can't even seem to find the room to move..I smoked my last cigarette   Threw that nasty habit away   Laid down my last dollar on my last bet   Didn't ever win anyway      Gave up the wine and whiskey   'Cause everybody said I should   But I'm givin' up on quittin' you, baby   'Cause it feels so damn good      You are my strongest weakness   Can't get enough, can't give you up   You are my deepest secret   I know it's wrong but I can't go on      And I try, try, try   I ask myself why, why, why?.In the heat of the night, when you know it ain't right   But you do what you want to do   You do what you feel, no one can feel like you   Out in the summertime city, ain't it a pity   There's so much to tie you down   You're leaving tonight to somewhere you can't be found   While down at the edge of town   At a pool hall where they all hang around   You hear them talkin' about the girls they knew   And talk about what they're gonna do   Then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?.All my girls      All the girls can be shakin' in the bounce tonight   Gonna do it like we do when the bounce is right   If it's cool we can rock until the morning light   Can you feel the vibe?.Ten little Indians   Standin' in a row   All dressed up   But nowhere to go   Lookin' for a target   Lookin' for a man ........      Just get me outta here   It's not the place   My mind's been thinkin' on   Just push me out again   It's no use hangin' round or hangin'on      Seven little Indians   Standin' in a row   The compere walks on the stage and he says   ""Sing it Girls""   But the band's no good   And the song don't cut it      Just get me outta here   It's not the place   My mind's been thinkin' on   Just push me out again   It's no use hangin' round or hangin'on      Come on, let's go tonight   We gotta brand new way to celebrate it   Oh - I got this rage to love   Baby - it's so right   And if you feel it ...   Good !"
"The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.  One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body. Two hours fly by and the girls got it. They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.  The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other. All of this happened with me recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.  Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them I would not know what laughter is..I can feel your goodbye comin'   Like a storm up from the south   The rain'll splatter at the back door   The wind'll whistle 'round the house   So it's

while   You won't be a boy no more   Young, but not a child      [Chorus]   I'm the gypsy, the acid queen   Pay me before I start   I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed      To tear your soul apart      Gather your wits and hold them fast   Your mind must learn to roam   Just as the gypsy queen must do   You're gonna hit the road      My work's been done, now look at him   He's never been more alive   His head it shakes, his fingers clutch   Watch his body writhe      [Chorus]      To break your little heart      If your child ain't all he should be now   This girl will put him right   I'll show him what he could be now   Just give me one more night      [Chorus]      To tear your soul apart.In my world of hurt!!.For once in my life   I've got someone who needs me   Someone I've needed so

" Entering into the classroom, I began to shiver from anxiety. I was the new student in the fourth grade, transferring from a public grade school to a @CAPS1 school kept my head swimming with questions, which I put aside as I stepped into the room with a large white ""@NUM1"" on the exterior wall. I swear, I could feel my bones literally shaking because of my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I came in. I noticed that they were all surrounding this @CAPS4-go-lucky brunette. No one really even took note that I was there until the teacher looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked back at that brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my to-be peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, with my feet uncontrollably glued to the ground, looking blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I soon became green with envy over her because of all the attention she got. I was unintentionally a fairly jealous child, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be her friend and I got somewhat ignored, I stomach slowly twisted in knots more and more each day as I began to form feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl. Even her name sounded suspicious to me. @PERSON1. I had never in my life heard of anyone named @PERSON1 before. Luckily, I sat on the opposite side of the classroom as her. And even as a month passed, I still felt uncomfortable being near her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday soon began to creep up after the first month at @LOCATION1. I was beginning to find out which people I wanted to be friends with, and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people I had gradually grown weary of, had to be invited to my birthday party because it was a class party and I didn't want anyone to be left out and since the class only had thirty people in it, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread around and people would begin to talk. I knew that I hadn't built up enough of a reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality was actually like. As, I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige, square cubby, I hesitated when I came across ""#@NUM2"". This was her number. The number of that girl with the bizarre name that I had an undeserved, grudge-like suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after I put that birthday party invitation into her cubby. When the day for the party finally rolled around, I had everything set up just how I imagined. I even had the perfect @CAPS2 @CAPS3 cake picked out for myself. The guests began to arrive knocking at the glass door, temporarily staining it little grimy knuckle prints. @PERSON1 came alone. As I opened the door, she timidly and immediately shoved a gift at me and shyly muttered under her breath ""@CAPS4 birthday @CAPS5"". I welcomed her traditionally, as I did with everyone else and showed her to the backyard. The party continued to go in several directions until my mom gathered everyone around, so I could blow out the candles. @PERSON1 stepped up next to me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned down to whisper that @PERSON1 had the same birthday as me and she would blow out the candles with me. I couldn't believe it. The person who I had selfishly pretended to not exist, was the person who I had to share my cake with. After blowing out the candles, everyone left because the party ended and I silently pouted for having to share my birthday with another person. After the party, I walked into the house, only to find @PERSON1 sitting on my steps. Her mom apparently couldn't pick her up for another hour. I came over to her and casually started making small talk with her. A few minutes later, my brother ran in with a huge glob of frosting in his hand. He yelled @CAPS4 birthday to me and threw it at my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his room as I continued to stand there with my mouth gaping. Then, I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned around to see @PERSON1 giggling. And without warning I started laughing too. And neither one of us could stop. It was at that moment when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom came, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we were unsuccessful, I had grown to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get close to. @PERSON1, through that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today..I really am, watch me strum my guitar   I'm punk hear me roar!.I'll go down fightin'   But rather be delightin'   All the people that come to see   The Devil's from Chicago   Now

forgotten   And nothing's forgiven      But I cried a river   A river for him   That's deeper and wider   Than I'll ever swim   The heart it will harden   The sorrow will dim   But I cried a river   A

Or the name I am calling      But I cried a river   A river for him   That's deeper and wider   Than I'll ever swim   The heart it will harden   The sorrow will dim   But I cried a river   A river for him      So weep for the sons   And the dear darling daughters   For the passing of time   And the parting of waters   For all who have passed through   This world long before me   To a far distant shore line   Where no one waits for me      But I cried a river   A river for him   That's deeper and wider   Than I'll ever swim   The heart it will harden   The sorrow will dim   But I cried a river   A river for him.Did you ever feel that just by jumping on a plane   All your cares would drop away   And you'd be born again      Returning to a nature child   Happy wild and free   But

" I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a @CAPS1 coastline. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were @NUM1 kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was @PERSON1. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored @PERSON1. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.  We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. There were mini hermit crabs, great big hermit crabs, and even bigger hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @PERSON1 and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!  When it was time to leave, @PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this is the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before. I thought why not? @PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was absent.  Back on the road my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music playing, my parents talking. and our wheels rolling down the narrow dirt road.Every once in a while I would have to move a little because I could feel my little hermit crab checking out his surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a blood curdling scream. As my dad slammed on the brakes dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom swiveling in her seat to look at me and ask what was wrong. I didn't answer. As the pincers grabbed on again, I let out another urgent scream. I then decided it was time to quit hiding my little friend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged scream I pointed down to my crotch. My sister's urgent hands pulled my swimsuit off and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty that my mom just laughed. She said that I had already gotten my punishment for lying, and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I sure wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends pulled over too. When we asked if everything was okay, they said while laughing, that one of the girls had gotten pinched by @PERSON1's hermit crab. That sent all of us laughing.  We never stopped laughing about that story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys that I like, or adults that I don't even know. Every time my mother says that that crab grabbed right onto ""where it counts"" we all bust out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red in embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it.  @PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few extra lessons. First of all, never put and animal near your ""sensitive"" parts. The second lesson was don't lie, because eventually you will most likely be be caught and punished. The last lesson would have to be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it is time to let it go, let whatever it is let it go, and be grateful for the time you got to enjoy it. If I would have been able to just say good bye to my shelled friends, I would have never lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful for them. Not only because I became a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always sends people up in laughter..We're here waiting for you   We're here waiting for you      We are yours   We're waiting for you   We are yours   We're waiting for you      We all pray for the end   For the god to take us..You think you're cool, right?.Vibrant peace envelopes my lack..When I look back at that night I get a warm spot across my heart""   Then he shook my hand, and walked away..See you moving through the square   In your motorcycle leather   Diamonds cascade at your feet   In an instant we are forever      See you're a rebel with a cause   No one ever gets close to you   Oh whoa whoa whoa   You're my wild one      Oh whoa whoa whoa   Come on stay my little wild one   Wild one   Yeah      And you've got a crooked smile   That takes that chip right off my shoulder   And though your heart is out of reach   I know that this world will make you colder      So you're escaping down the road   Into an outlaw world that only you know   Oh whoa whoa whoa   You're my wild one      Oh whoa whoa whoa   Come on stay my little wild one   Oh whoa whoa whoa   You can't stay free      You can't stay mine   Oh whoa whoa whoa   Come on stay my little black swan   This town seems small and lonely      And you're the property of no one   Turn again turn around   All roads lead to London town   Wild one      Yeah   Oh whoa whoa whoa   You're my wild one   Oh whoa whoa whoa      Come on stay my little wild one   Oh whoa whoa whoa   You can't stay free   You can't stay mine      Oh whoa whoa whoa   Oh whoa whoa whoa   Yeah   Oh whoa whoa whoa      Yeah   Oh whoa whoa whoa   Yeah   Oh whoa whoa whoa      Yeah   Wild one   Wild one   Yeah      Oh whoa whoa whoa   Yeah   Oh whoa whoa whoa   Yeah      Wild one   Oh whoa whoa whoa.There's nothing good on the T.

"                       My @CAPS1  @CAPS2 was a warm, @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to be seen. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours straight. That person was my @CAPS1.  My @CAPS1, @PERSON1, came over to hang out with the rest of the family and friends that were at my house. He was talking, laughing, and having a really good time. Of course, I was only about five or six years old at the time; but to me, aside from my dad, my @CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world. That @TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all of the adults. All of a sudden, my @CAPS1 came up to me, gave me a big hug and started to talk to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke around and laugh, I was thrilled to have all the attention. I used to call them laugh attacks. Anytime my @CAPS1 talked to me, I started laughing and I would laugh so hard that I couldn't stop. That @TIME1, I had one of them. My @CAPS1 and I were joking around and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. @CAPS2 went on for about an hour straight. That was long after my @CAPS1 left and went back to the adults. My friend, @LOCATION2, sat next to me and tried to get me to stop laughing. She was laughing too, but not as much as me.  Finally, after a long hour or so, I got myself to calm down. The rest of the @TIME1 was great but every so often, I started to laugh again. There was absolutely no way that I was going to stop giggling until I went to bed. After a long @TIME1 of having a good time, everyone left and went home. When my @CAPS1 came to say goodbye to me, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew that I would see him again. The next day, I was right about being able to stop laughing. I still smiled and hung out with my family, but I wasn't laughing uncontrollably.    My @CAPS1 was and still is a huge part of my life. He is always the person that can make me laugh and forget about all of my worries. Even though I don't live near him anymore, I can still talk to him on the phone and laugh and joke around with him. When I go visit him down in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 seems like we just pick things up where they left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other in a really long time.   When my dad passed away, my @CAPS1 was always there for me. He is the one male figure that I still have in my life. After everything that I've gone through, I could always count on him to brighten the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really do need a person like my @CAPS1 in their lives. @CAPS2 really does help to know that you have someone that loves you and can brighten your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @CAPS1 is very close, and the one thing that kept @CAPS2 that way is all of the laughs that we have shared through the years. Laughter is a huge part of anyone's life. I have grown up around laughter and the thought of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss, and sadness. However, after everything that I have come through, I can always come out laughing. When I was eleven years old, my dad passed away. At an even younger age, my parents got divorced. No matter how much those things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving on with my life..My goal is to find just a piece of your love..I've become the person I've admired      And if you've ever crossed   your heart and hoped to die   The voices in your head saying you must cry   Then there's more to you than meets the eye   But if you go about your business with capital be   They're sure to cut you up with a capital see   And then you will be dead with a capital be.You're so extreme, you're super heavy   You're one step over the line   Not what you seem, don't try and tell me   I know what's really on your mind      Once you get started you're out of control   Don't play that sweet and innocent with me girl   I know you know you want to rock and roll   But I got just what you need      I, I want to feel your love   Too much is not enough   I, I want to feel your touch   Too much is not enough      You've got it bad, you're hopelessly addicted   You're always searching for the cure   Love is the crime, you stand convicted   You keep on coming back for more      Come on admit it, you're over the top   That song and dance won't work with me girl   You just can't quit it, don't know when to stop   But I got the remedy      I, I want to feel your love   Too much is not enough   I, I want to feel your touch   Too much is not enough      Baby stop wasting time   And let me know that you're mine   I need to feel your embrace   How much can I take.Bad, It's the bloody fix you do, oh, Look out   You see what's in you head: fantasy   And need, but you can't have B.A.D..Don't say you love me when it's just a rumor   Don't say a word if there is any doubt   Sometimes I think that love is just a tumor   You've got to cut it out      You say you're sorry for the things that you've done   You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it   I wouldn't worry, I had so much fun   Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being      It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue   It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue   Oh yeah      Get to the slot machine, almost dead on arrival   Just hit me one more time with that live wire   Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million   You say I've got no feelings, this is a good way to kill them      Select the control and then insert the token   You want to throw me away but I'm not broken   You've got a lot to say--well, I'm not joking   There are some words they don't allow to be spoken   Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being      It's you, not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue.Won't you go to someone else's dreams?.Oh boatman, I am the river,   I am the mountain and the sea..Is it because we got the 89 vision?.Well take me to my car now   But the car won't go   Try to get next to you baby   Ain't got no place to go   Taste better than a t-bone steak   Excitement on the side   If we don't find some place to get off   Gonna lose it on the ride   Well you and me baby, go hand in hand   Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man   Well you and me baby, go hand in hand   Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man   I wanna take you in my room   Make them sleepers cry   Got a feeling down inside   You know it ain't no lie   You and me just in my room   When the circle comes around   No misfortune in your life   When your feet have left the ground   Well you and me baby, go hand in hand   Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man   Well you and me baby, go hand in hand   Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man   Room shaking in the car now   And the car won't go   Try and get next to you baby   Ain't got no place to go   Taste better than a t-bone steak   Excitement on the side   If we don't find some place to get off   Gonna lose it on the ride   Well you and me baby, go hand in hand   Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man   Well you and me baby, go hand in hand   Like a bowlegged woman, and a knock-kneed man.I'm shaking off the chains, I'm tired of all the pain,   I'm shaking off the chains, let me live again,   Shaking off the chains, shaking off the chains..Cause I am kinda feeling like

"                             laughter @CAPS1 funny, normally when i fall of line, for some reason @CAPS1 humorous to me. I'm laughing in my head the hole way down down a rapid.I've taken plenty of beat downs whale I have been kayaking, @CAPS2 i think that my day running the upper stretch of the white salmon might have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call that day the @CAPS5 beat down. @CAPS4 was a very nice day and I felt like @CAPS4 would just be a normal day on the upper white salmon, @CAPS2 oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @PERSON3, @PERSON2 and I parked the car. @PERSON3 had brought the wrong size spray skirt for his creek boat. I had no doubt that we could conquer this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @CAPS4 took the strength of all three of us to get @CAPS4 on. After a long hike through an empty creek bed we found our selves at the put in. This is a fairly simple put in, you start off with finding a faltish spot on a @NUM1 foot rock slide. after you find your spot, you simply slide down the rock and of a seven foot drop into water. Unfortunately @CAPS4 wasn't that simple for me, I slid down the rock and of the drop perfectly fine @CAPS2 little did I know I didn't put my spray skirt on all the way so when I dropped into the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @CAPS4 because @CAPS4 was just a gallon. I actually thought @CAPS4 was kinda funny and that put a good feeling in my gut because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @CAPS4 would help my weight distribution a little bit. There for I didn't empty out my boat and we just started paddling down stream.  The first few rapids were no big deal I poked through all the holes there were and I felt like I was doing realitavly good because @CAPS4 had been a while scene I had paddled this stretch. We were about half way through our run when I was starting to realize the magnitude of how gnarly this river was, I was rolling in every rapid I possibly could and laughing my face of every time, @CAPS2 I couldn't quit, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @DATE1 foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was down stream! We were nearing the end of our trip and we had @CAPS2 only one more big drop still left to conquer. @CAPS5 falls, a @NUM2 foot drop (depends on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop isn't like any ordanry waterfall in fact this drop isn't really anything like a waterfall, sure you definitely will feel the free fall @CAPS2 the water hydrolics are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon gets narrow and when all that water goes over a ledg @CAPS4 creates a hole at the bottom. @CAPS4 is also legged out at the bottom so there's tons of water boiling back up stream, so ounce your stuck in that hole @CAPS1 like trying to paddle up hill and there's basically no way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath and stay calm. We were neering @CAPS5 falls and there's only @NUM3 eddies you can catch before the falls so you can scout @CAPS4. Funny enough when I was trying to make the second @PERSON1 my boat got bumped out by @PERSON3's boat and that little bump ended up flipping me upside down and spinning me backwards, at this point there wasn't much I could do about the next few minutes of my life. So I plunged over the falls, I was mixed up in a huge whitewater mess for about a minute and a half, only having brief moments where I could possibly catch a breath of air. I toughed through @CAPS4 and didn't pull my spray skirt because i didn't want to drink from the shoe(don't ask) and because of if I ended up ejecting from my boat there's no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I powered through @CAPS4, what was only a short minute seemed like a lifetime to me. I ended up getting flushed out down stream and rolling up perfectly unharmed. when I rolled up, I had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have made @CAPS4 if I didn't have a good attitude coming into this day and having the need to laugh in my head when I messed up. All in all laughing saved my life! .And it's bleeding on my face   And it's foaming at the mouth   And it's gnawing on my bones...

"                            Closer @CAPS1 @CAPS2  In life, I think that laughter is a very important element. Without it, everything just wouldn't seem as fun. Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter.  It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE1. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished.  First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a ""natural high"" day. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything.  With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS5 awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time.  Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... ""@CAPS4, how can two people ever be so much alike?!"" @CAPS5 that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS6 this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!.There's a rumour, there's a rumour   Rumour has it      Rumour has it all around the town   Someone's looking for a girl like me   Where can she be found   I hope it's who I think it is   I wonder if it's really him   It's got to be the man I love   No one else but him      Rumour has it   They say he's gonna make this girl his everything   He's gonna love her and surround her   With all those beautiful things   It was the most wonderful moment in my life I had   My life ended on that evening   I lost him, Lord it hurt so bad      Rumour has it

"Laughter, an important part of life, just the feeling of laughing is comforting because at that time everything is okay.Laughing brings people together and makes them laugh together, its like a way of communication. Once you laugh about something other people start laughing and it connects everybody together to be happy. Its like telling everybody to be happy but without even talking to them.That's when people laugh with you, but when they laugh at you, well that's a different story.I remember one day when I was home washing the dishes and everyone in my family was frustrated, even me.I hate being mad and I hate it when people get mad, so I said something, I don't remember what but then everyone started laughing,it put everyone in a good mood.I think of laughing like fire,one candle can light @NUM1 candles.When you hear people laugh, the first thing that comes to your mind is,""something must be funny"".And you want to go and see what it is so you can laugh too. that's very common for most people who like laughing. personally I love laughing because its a good weird feeling..First time we ever got a chance to be alone we knew....See'est la belle 'la Louise Anne te va fomma faire ma faume   Ta jolie a ta meion a ta pas bon   Why did you go and leave me in Lou'siana sweet Susannah   You left me for a fella who wore a big black umbrella   He came to the sticks to buy some antiques   He was a wheeler and a dealer the woman stealer   See'est la belle 'la Louise Anne...

"I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and,how they feel about you,@CAPS1 that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you. @CAPS1 you make someone laugh and they make you laugh then you are with the one and only true person.Laughter is from the heart and soul. @CAPS1 that person Tell's you something that makes you laugh then it is true between you two. Feelings,@CAPS2, @CAPS3 is a lot between two people. @CAPS3 is from the soul and down deep with in your body. as my mom would say @CAPS3 helps clear the mind and body , but what i really think is that @CAPS1 some one makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. you laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone make you laugh. @CAPS1 it say it is the important part of any relationship what it is trying to say or make a point of is that you need to laugh in your relationships and, have fun. But my thought about @CAPS3 is that you clear your mind and you have to listen about things and,then @CAPS4 it is funny then you start @CAPS3 about it. Here is what my mom use to says to everyone is that ""@CAPS4 you have not laughed at all today then you do not have a clear head or body"". There are times in peoples lives where they just laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping that, i think @CAPS3 is just a feeling that people have. You @MONTH1 tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they do not even make any since at all. You could be out with a bunch of your friends and at a party and you are just standing around and then you start @CAPS3 because one of them decided that is was to quite and we all needed a laugh. There are sometime you can play a game that is really funny and you have to make funny things or even do crazy stuff, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing only you need a laugh once and, a while. I mean don't everyone need a laugh, I tell my self almost everyday that @CAPS4 I don't laugh then I did not clear my mind or soul. But is it really about me no it is not. @CAPS1 you say you need a laugh people look at you like you are crazy but you really aren't. What you are really trying to say is can you can tell something funny then people will understand what you mean. I have been told funny things over the past few years but im a teenager what do you think i will remember them all. I am just like everyone else I will forget them over the years real easy. I not all that smart but after I think about it for a few min I finally under stand the joke. I know I am a @CAPS5 but I have those days where I am saying what to people what are you talking about, then they look at me and, they just say wow! you really are @CAPS5 and I also have @CAPS5 jokes about me and I really do not mind @CAPS1 people tell @CAPS5 jokes to me. Cause I am not affected at all I got use to it. @CAPS1 I heard my first @CAPS5 joke I had to stop and, think about it for a few mins then after about an hour I realized that they where trying to tell me that it was me. Then I walk up to them and I was like ""@CAPS6 I finally got that joke and, then I was like what a really good joke. @CAPS1 you have a laugh for the first time is because that someone special either made you laugh or they tickled you. They might even tell you a very funny story about themselves, or someone that is related to them. @CAPS1 you laugh is like your showing your feelings and, @CAPS2 to that person, because @CAPS4 you do laugh then it is just like wow you are really lost on what they where trying to tell you. I will always tell my self @CAPS4 i need a laugh or something to either call my friends up or just look in the mirror every morning. because for some odd reason i think i am just really funny looking. most people think that @CAPS4 you look at your self and make funny faces in the mirror you will laugh non stop. the reason i laugh is because i see or hear something really funny o just wanna laugh so much. @CAPS4 i have a good day or a good weekend i laugh a lot.Oh, too hard to see, well, put your mind aside   And stop using fear to hide behind   If you really knew   You would change your mind   If you knew the God I know   You would have the time   If you take a chance   I know you will find   Everything you need in love of another kind   If you really knew   You would change your mind   If you knew the God I know   You would have the time   If you take a chance   I know you will find   Everything you need in love   Everything you need in love of another kind   Love of another kind   God's love is enough for you   And it's waiting if you only   God's love is enough for you   And it's waiting if you only   God's love is enough for you   And it's waiting if you only knew   God's love is enough for you   And it's waiting.Girl in the world....I?.Holding you, I'm smiling too..Heart burnin', still yearnin'   Some day you'll be glad to have me around..You will tell me again   To find my freedom   Everlasting freedom.They're really saying is, ?I love you?.I swam before I had two hands      and held the distance in my toes..I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage   Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit   I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit   And still I, never sweat these bitches   Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures   Scalin fishes, my love is concrete   Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat   of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long   Still a bitch like me tryin to hold on   Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin   Girls steady screamin, 'Kim you need to leave him!'.When will you write your masterpiece?.There she lies, a vision in the dark   Invader of my heart   Look at me, behaving like a fool possessed   Damned if I'll be doomed   By this woman 'neath the moon over madness   Shall I kiss the mouth, stroke the hair   Undress her - do I dare   Or bite into the vein above her heaving breast   Ah, the sun best come up soon   There's no telling with the moon over madness   And when I see her face   The tuft of hair beneath the lace   I feel the fire of mortal men   As she draws a languorous breath   So full of life, so close to death   I'm filled with wild revenge   Shall I tear into her skin   Let the beast inside me win   I'm so uncertain   Or shall I fight my heart no more   Ease my lover to the floor   And loose my burden   What I'd give to know just what I am   A monster or a man   An angel born of Hell, or simply human flesh   One of which is in this room   Wondering 'neath the mood over madness   Shall I tear into her skin   Let the beast inside me win   I'm so uncertain   Or shall I end this lonely war   Ease my lover to the floor   And loose my burden   Woman won't you hold me in your arms   Before you come to harm   And take this tender love and drive it through my chest   Stike hard, do it soon   There's no telling with the moon over madness   My madness   Over you.Eponine   I know this is no place for me   Still I would rather be with you..This is who you see, this is who I am..And if we started all over today,   I think we know that we'd end up in the same place..Even I never spied that the scenes were posed..Go Johnny go   Johnny B.

"    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. It is also a key component to story telling, it shows that the listeners are enjoying what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone its almost as if your sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, it doesn't matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to burst out in laughter. Inside jokes are laughter's best friend, from the second they are made to the slightest mention of them, they always bring smiles and giggles to everyone's face.   As a person, I feel that it is my duty to make people laugh. One example of this would be when I was seven years old and spending the night at my friend @PERSON1's house. We had just gotten done watching @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. As it turns out @PERSON1's big sister @PERSON2 was the only one home, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her ""baby sister"", so we were to fend for ourselves. Being young, we didn't want a boring old @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 sandwich, we wanted to make @NUM1 cupcakes! This might sound like a ridiculous objective for two seven year old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled this with no problems, or so we thought. In reality it was a disaster, we had no idea what a mixer was so we mixed everything with our hands, which worked up until I brought the flower out. From now on I will never think of flower in the same manner, every time I open the jar of flower all I can think about is the mess @PERSON1 and I had made that day.   Lets just say it was a disaster, enough flower to successfully make @NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the whole bag. As I was getting ready to pour this tremendous quantity of flower into the bowl, I slipped on some of the vegetable oil that had spilled out of the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @PERSON1 started laughing as soon as the white powdery cloud filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention covered in what felt like enough batter to feed the entire world. Now that I am a quite a bit older, I don't think I could have taken such a tremendous mess so lightly, considering I would most definitely be the one cleaning it all up. But as a little girl, laughing was the only thing that mattered. @PERSON1 couldn't stop giggling as she was looking at my whole body covered in white. We started to play in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air as if it was confetti. When all of the sudden @PERSON2 came down the stairs, took one look at the kitchen and started to yell, ""@CAPS6 and clean this up! I was upstairs for and hour and you manage to make this big of a mess? Mom will be home in twenty minutes and you had better have this kitchen cleaned"" @PERSON1 and I looked up at each other and back at the kitchen. Then was when it hit me just how much work we had to do. All of the sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, it felt as if I had no care in the world.    It turns out that @PERSON1 and I completely ignored @PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were in the middle of building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called ""snow"". I heard the slam of the front door as @PERSON1's mom walked into the house. It sounded like paper towels being ripped right from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean up anything, we in fact made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to run down into the basement to pretend we had done nothing wrong at all. That @MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream, ""@PERSON1! What is this??"" . Slowly we climb the stairs to the kitchen and @PERSON1 starts explaining herself. I choose to stay quiet because I had never gotten in trouble by someone that wasn't my own mom before. When @PERSON1 is done telling her story, her mom tells us to go downstairs. Both of us are on the verge of crying, when all of the sudden @PERSON1 starts laughing once again. I could think of nothing that would possibly be funny at this moment when she says, "" you still have flower in your hair"".    From this experience I have learned that sometimes, laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I have moved away since this cupcake fiasco, I know that if I ever talk to @PERSON1 again we will begin laughing at just the mention of this story. .You might say that we're young   You might say we're unlearned   But there's one thing I know   Though I'm younger than you   Even Jesus would never forgive what you do   Let me ask you one question   Is your money that good?.Check it out   I break a nigga down ugly like Coke, up on the scale   Next step throw a stack up on the third rail   The undisputed, I'm never ever diluted or polluted   You could fuse it, if ya choose it

" Laughter is a huge part of life, in fact it is all i wanted to see my grandfather @PERSON1, do before his final days. I remember when i was about five years old i loved to draw, it didn't matter what it was as long as i had fun. My grandpa would give me helpful tips on shading, texture, and the over all image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after I figured out how to use his techniques. We would always have a good time together, he was an artist himself who has painted most of the pictures in his house, along with a few at restaurants. I spent most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, which is where my grandparents lived. I can't remember the last time i was at @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, but i can remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a young kid like me to do there. Another time about @NUM1 years back, my grandpa went to heat up his coffee in the microwave, and instead of putting his coffee in, he found potatoes. He instantly made hash browns out of them and we had a good laugh. There is a lot i wish i got to do with my grandparents, like go fishing, or even camping. Yet there is a lot i did do with them, my grandpa also painted my boy scouts derby wooden race car. When ever i had a race or competition with boats, cars, or planes, he was the one to paint them. He would come to every race to see how i did, and for some odd reason i got @NUM2 place most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ORGANIZATION1, i named him when i was young. He and I grew up like buddies together, and my grandpa @ORGANIZATION1 and I would always go on walks together. My grandpas favorite thing to do with the dog was train him. He's the most obedient dog I've ever seen, he would go to the mail man and get the mail to bring back, he opened and closed doors if it had a rope, he would even get my grandmas slippers in the bedroom. When i lived in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, everyday after school i would be picked up by my grandparents and go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until i was old enough to be alone. Grandma would always help me with math homework and cook dinner and then afterwords grandpa would help me with drawing or turn my favorite @CAPS2 show on. When i was young i would go over to there house in the morning and grandpa would have recorded my favorite show ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4"". Every morning that was the routine, and then breakfast. Later on in my life when I became more independent i didn't go over to their house as often as I used to and it is something I cant take back. A few home videos I've looked at recently reminded me of a good time with them, my grandpa was recording me chase the dog around the kitchen table and i stubbed my toe. Apparently it was humorous to my family, all who were laughing in hysterics. Another time when I as younger my grandpa was a barber shop owner and cut hair for years in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, and at his house one time i didn't know what a ""mullet"" was but i knew it was a hair style. I pleaded and pleaded until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet hair cut, i was astonished to what it looked like and immediately hated it. The last @CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa I bought lot's of presents for him and my family. Thanks to the @DATE1 job i had on the eastern part of the state, i was able to get a heating blanket that covered his whole bed, a couple movies, and his favorite "" @CAPS6"" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I had saw him in a long time, which made me happy too. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything had gone, you will notice the best of times are only a laugh away..Servants: We got Annie!.Cool, clear water..And the sun's given up..Do ya like

" Laughter is important in all relationships of any kind. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what is the point? I have four friends that mean the world to me. @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1. @CAPS1's real name is @PERSON1 but we all call her @CAPS1 because how she acts. @PERSON2 and I use to do almost everything together. We were inseperable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals talking to eachother. @PERSON2 and I can make eachother laugh no matter what the situation @MONTH1 be. I remember when @PERSON2 and I hadn't been getting along like we usually do. One day at around nine p.m. my phone rings, it was @PERSON2 I didn't know whether or not to pick up or to just pretend to be busy so the two of us didn't argue. Well I decided to pick up because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew that she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I could hear @LOCATION1 crying. I panicked, @PERSON2 was not one to just cry because of something little. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me all about it even though we were fighting I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @TIME1 before it had been @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, our whole posse or whatever you wanted to call it went together and everything had seemed fine except the usual pointless arguements that always ended in a laugh. Little did we know that the past two weeks @PERSON2's @CAPS3 had been ""house sitting"" he hadn't planned on returning home to his family. As i listen to @PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she cried I cried. Her @CAPS3, broke the news to her @DATE1 @TIME1 after we left for @ORGANIZATION1. He will not be returning home because he hasn't been happy there for awhile and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @PERSON2 felt, my parents got divorced when I was very young. Although it didn't tear me apart like it did her it still effected me. Not having a real family with one home and two parents who were married and inlove was never easy on anyone. @PERSON2 had not the slightest idea that her @CAPS3 would later get married and start a family with a woman he had been seeing for over a year while coming home to his family. She just kept telling me that she had to bring him home, that she couldn't do this. @PERSON2 and her @CAPS3 were really close, she was daddy's girl one hundred percent. I remember her telling me that she just wanted to disappear it was all her fault. All I could do as her friend was listen and tell her it would be okay. @PERSON2 began to calm down and grasp the fact that things happen and she couldn't change her @CAPS3's mind. I invited @PERSON2 over for the @TIME1 to just hangout and maybe get thigns off her mind for awhile. It couldn't be easy sitting in her home with her @CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and everytime I messed up she would laugh. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh again made me feel better about things because I knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her @CAPS3 leaving. Without the laughter in that room I'm not sure me and @PERSON2 would have been able to ever be good friends again. Afterall laughing at me messing up on guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So it's very important to have laughter in a relationship because once the laughter is gone then the friendship or whatever you know is going dowhill. Now @PERSON2 and I talk for endless hours or text about anythign and everything and when we aren't laughing we know to ask one another what is wrong..Her daddy gave her magic,   I can tell by the way she walks..Oh my my, I could love you forever..Fight!.I don't know where I'm going,   I don't know what I need,   But I'll get to where I'm gonna end up,   And that's alright by me..Open up your eyes and realize that you deserve better..And now we're flying through the stars..Often I wonder why I must journey   Over a road so rugged and steep   While there are others living in comfort   While with the lost I labour and weep..Get a deal on tape)   Have you heard the news?.Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world..Then she's in control!.Why don't you come on and let us play?.Someday soon   Ooh, there'll be a better day..I think that I am upside down..The sun in me   Oh...

" It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS7 best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS2 was. @CAPS2 had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS2 had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS2 could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS12 guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose."" @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 scoffed, ""your the kid they think can beat me."" ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS1 I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. ""@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!"" the coach called out, ""@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking."" ""@CAPS1."" I said, ""your name is what."" ""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS7 piece. Bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS7 turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS2 didn't even look like @CAPS2 cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.  @CAPS8 picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS2 moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS1 I picked up @CAPS7 king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS7 in @CAPS13 game. I hit @CAPS7 clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS7 game.   @CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS2 was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS2 just did fools @CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS7 queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10."" in a loud voice.  @CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS2 said,""I do @CAPS13 with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS13 opening.""@CAPS2 started to laugh again, @CAPS13 time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two."" That surprised me I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really @CAPS2 had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again, the coach came over and saw that I won @CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @CAPS8 said, ""@CAPS13 is the start of a new beginning I can quit board one now for there is someone who can beat me."" @CAPS2 walked up to the coach and must have told him that @CAPS2 wanted me on board one for now I'm on board one and @CAPS7 new friend, @CAPS8 is there with me on board two.

"                   Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People A thing we have done since birth is laugh. Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves awkward situations, brings people together, and makes life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together. Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable.   I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I knew about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and just kept working hard. Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a little uncomfortable. After the last practice it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous cause what if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but everyone hated me on the team? He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called. When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me. I then told them how I didn't really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider. They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone, and I said no not really they didn't try talking to me so I thought why should I? My mom then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there. I thought about it and realized I really hadn't. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I also wasn't myself, because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around, I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time. I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there. The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named @PERSON1. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth. Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the practice went great. The awkward moments faded away into laughter. We all worked hard and joked around with each other, laughed, and I really felt like we were bonding. They laughter had brought us together. All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same. I believe that day that laughter brought our team together.  I will never forget that day. It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how well it brings people together. That season of volleyball I made many new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together, just because you known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter has to fade away, because I believe it should get stronger. Whenever I am meeting new people I always try to break the ice and lighten up the mood with something funny, because I think that a big point in our lives is to be happy, have fun, and all laugh togther.

"The mood was sweet and the room was worm with most of my family and friends. except for my brother and at the time i was only about @NUM1 or @NUM2? Hell i can't really remember so I'm just going to guess on the age. Whatever getting back to the story, so I'm looking all around our @NUM1 story house trying to find my brother but for some reason this time it just seems impossible. And all I can hear in the back ground is my family laughing as this little @NUM1 or @NUM2 year old is running full speed up and down hallways and opening and closing doors to rooms that hes never been in be for. And also shouting at the top of his lungs ""@CAPS1 where you be at i can't finded you"". And with one more door to open that's at the beginning of the hallway where every one is sitting or standing. This little boy comes running down the hall in a panic who can't find his brother. And opens up the door and out pops @PERSON1 his brother who is wearing the scary monster mask and says ""I will get you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner"". So know what I did just as he told me to do. I ate my dinner so fast I ended up throwing up because a was so scared that he was going to come after me that night!

" Hi my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girls. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @CAPS2. Honestly I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has @CAPS2 made me the person I am but @CAPS2 has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1.  @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. just like everyone else we have hard time and we have good times. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When i wake up its still really dark outside. The smell of fresh @TIME1 air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after i wake up i text @PERSON1 good @TIME1 and we usually, always talk through out the @TIME1. Some times he comes to see me or i just see him at school. When i see him i am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point he thinks its time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how i look, what i am wearing and what i say. He doesn't find @CAPS2 hurtful but to me @CAPS2 is. Many times i might even say something mean back which doesn't help @CAPS2 just makes @CAPS2 worse.  Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. @PERSON1 tells me he has done nothing wrong. So i try to explain @CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but i am not going to fight anymore so i just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind so i cry, and he gives me a dumbness look. This just makes everything worse so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place its a mess. I usually storm of in the middle @CAPS2 cause i cant take anymore.  Finally time goes by and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still each of us on edge so i say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong i still love him and cant stand for @CAPS2 to be like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what i was looking for this makes me happy and laugh. @PERSON1 will than ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if i don't answer or if i say no, @CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple things to me. I feel bad cause i hate the stress and the fight, so we work @CAPS2 out.  Now you can see if i didn't have laughter i might be depressed. Without laughter things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If @CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way than @CAPS2 can change your life in a major way. Things @MONTH1 come across as hard of rough. When i look back on my life and see what @CAPS2 has done to me and for me i realize i laughed at something each one of those days even though i was done and @CAPS2 brought me back up again..Do you dream of a time that's better?.In time I will find a girl   Who knows just how to be kind..Don't want to fight anymore oh no   Don't want to cry anymore no more   Don't want to fight anymore oh no   Don't want to cry anymore no more      One nation   One family   No limitation   No enemy      No I don't want to fight anymore   No I don't, I don't, no I don't   No I don't want to cry anymore   Don't want to cry   No I don't, I don't   No I don't, oh no      No weapons   No secrecy   All slogans   Blind loyalty      No I don't want to fight anymore   No I don't, I don't, no I don't, no I don't   No I don't want to cry anymore   No I don't, I don't, no I don't, no I don't      You know I don't, you know I don't   You know I don't, you know I don't want to cry   You know I don't, you know I don't   You know I don't, you know I don't   You know I don't, you know I don't   You know I don't, you know I don't want to fight   You know I don't, you know I don't      No righteous   No cruelty   No weapons   No self-defense   No quarrel   No arrogance   No hurt you   Rise above revenge      No I don't want to fight anymore   No I don't, no I don't don't don't   No I don't want to cry anymore   No I don't no I don't      Do I want to fight anymore oh no   Don't want to cry anymore no more   I don't no I don't   No I don't want to fight anymore   I don't no I don't      Don't want to fight anymore oh no   Don't want to cry anymore no more   No I don't want to fight anymore   No I don't no I don't   No I don't want to cry anymore   No I don't no I don't no I don't!.Under his nose was a dream come true..Ha ha ha ha   My soul is burnin, about to catch fire!.I know your kind, you pick a girl (guy)   Then change your mind and have a whirl   Now the gals (guys) that you've kissed say   I'm next on your list, uh, uh, baby.....Lets Go!.Well I don't know what kind of spice   But it must be healthy 'cause it's sterilized..So let your love come easy, you don't need to be afraid,   I just want your body and your soul..Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502..Time rearranges..You were content to let me shine, that's your way..[Chorus:]   First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)   Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)   Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)   Faster, it's all right..Hello, goodbye my friend   Feels like the start all over again   But I'd rather not pretend   There aren't things still left to mend   Somebody break my fall   I'm slipping down all over again      I'm doing it all over   Taking my own sweet time   I may make it slower   But I'm taking my own sweet time   I'm taking my own sweet...

" When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the "" big kid"" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION1 followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM1,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION1 parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION3. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2'. There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION1 i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION1 began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down.  finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked ""how many?"". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION1 said ""row eight"". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION1 they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION1 stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION1 some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION1 the yelled "" blast off"" @ORGANIZATION1 the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION1 plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION1 turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION1 I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on I was addicted to roller coasters, @ORGANIZATION1 have ridden many since..I need you, I need you babe   Like I never needed anyone   You're wrong but you're so much fun   You say you trat me mean to keep   The opinion of that night   But you taste like the fourth of July   Malt liquor on your breath, my, my...

"  On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved that the most. @CAPS1 was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean its his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, thats awsome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and i went to is called @LOCATION1. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue ether. Yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I say him through the window. He turned his head and smilled, I could see all the glue still wet and it's everywhere.  My brother and me always had a good relationship, we both mad each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probable wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very importent part to any kind of relationship. It alows poth people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sence of humor you have.  As we approched the house, we saw @CAPS1 sitting on the porch waitting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS1 had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people dont come over. @CAPS1 said the whole family was coming over. My brother and i were so happy, we both new grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy. Grandma showed up alittle after dad did. @CAPS1 was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brothers face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays. When my brother was at the table @CAPS1 brang in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier.  When the birthday cake was over and the presients, my brother and i went out to the back yard to play kickball. My brother wouldnt use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play, we both were having fun. We laught every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back and as the ball came close i kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast, insted of the ball going to his feet it went to his head. When the ball conected to his head he did a back flip off the ground. @CAPS1 and grandma were in aw, i was frozen still. When he got up he looked straight at me and laught. @CAPS1 started to laugh so did grandma, i was still frozen. I finaily went with it and by the time I started i couldnt stop. it was so funny, he got pickup off the ground and hit in the head with a ball and still laughs.   When it was time for everyone to go, @CAPS1 said her good byes and then it was grandmas turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forhead than me.

"One day I woke @CAPS6 staring out my window and was listening to the birds chirp out my window I usually leave my window open to sleep with fresh air because I hate breathing in my own breath its to warm anyways as I woke @CAPS6 I walked out and ate some rice crispy s with my to sisters @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. As I was about to finish I had realized I was late for school I was only I @NUM1 grade so I ran got dressed and told my sisters to @CAPS5 and get ready but you no how girls can be putting @CAPS4 there make-@CAPS6 and doing there hair.      My sister @PERSON2 was in @NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @CAPS4 our way heading off to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only liked her was because when we were cleaning our desk she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We began the day with a book and the book was by ""@CAPS1 foul"" I can't recall the name but I remember the cover was gold an was about ghouls and monsters the way she read it was like if we were there that book was so intense even tho i really didn't understand it. Next she would give us a math worksheet I know right math in @NUM1 grade but I was really smart at math and she would always pick @CAPS4 me and give me harder math then others and when I asked her why I was getting harder math then the other kids she had told me I was different. I new I was smarter then some kids but not all so I never knew if that was a complement or an insult but I really didn't care. So now that we got that out of the way we can get to the fun part were all the laughter is so school is over right and I'm trying to find my sister to walk me home, after @NUM5 min looking for i find her walking to the cross walk I yell her name ""@CAPS2"". She looks and I'm running to her and her friends as you no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street.   My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a @CAPS5 to get to the car and I had to wait for the cross guard lady to @CAPS3 to me. At last she finally had noticed me, I was @CAPS4 walking in an hurried past to get to the car because I had herd my dad yelling ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6""so I was walking faster and faster and as I was walking I herd from a distance a car speeding down the street, but what I hadn't noticed it was it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner nearly hit the cross guard lady, the car had hit the crossing stick the out of no were I was hit flying and rolling down the street. I was hit and bruised cuts every were my dad was panicking ran out of the car screaming at the lady who had hit me and getting her information license plate number.    As I was laying @CAPS4 the ground my dad came to me and was trying to get me @CAPS6 he pulled down my pants to see the damage and remember I had my scooby-doo underwear @CAPS4 and every one was staring at me I was more embarrassed then hurt I didn't feel the pain until the next day so I was all good I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and every one was laughing at me because they saw my underwear @CAPS4 and my dad rushed me to the house and then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have trouble doing sports because i have a fractured hip. i was living the dream my sisters were spoiling me giving me candy and my dad giving me ice cream and @CAPS4 top of that I couldn't feel the pain. Bu t the fireman said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and i was limping and what she told me got me mad she had told me to ""stop faking it"". I had told my mom that and she got so mad man you would not want to be that teacher so lets say it wasn't pretty. You're probably wondering what happened to the lady who hit me she pays for my docter bills. .Unbelievable!.I know this town..Some people's lives fade like their dreams,   too tired to rise, too tired to sleep..Even in the dark I know I'm alive..Well sometimes   It seems you just don't understand   The way I think and who I am   And when I'm   I'm told what I'm supposed to be   You think you know what's best for me      Well I want to see you standing next to me now   Seems you've got nothing much to say   And when you're dying lying next to me now   I'll turn my head and walk away      Sometimes   It seems I might be losing touch   Or maybe I just try to much   Now I   Now I get told I'm crazy   Nothing you could say would phase me now      I want to see you standing next to me now   Seems you've got nothing much to say   And when you're dying lying next to me now   I'll turn my head and walk away      Hey      I walk alone   My thought's aren't always carved in stone   My life revolves according to me   And what you think don't mean a fucking thing to me   Yeah you'll see   I'll make it farther on my own      Well I want to see you standing next to me now   Seems you've got nothing much to say   And when you're dying lying next to me now   I'll turn my head and walk away   I want to see you standing next to me now   Seems you've got nothing much to say   And when you're dying lying next to me now   I'll turn my head and walk away.Bakit, lagi kang nagdududa   Ayaw mong maniwalang   Pagibig ko ay tunay...

"So my friends and i got into a heated discusion on how we need to keep things to our selves cause one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us allot of problems in school and around town, @CAPS1 he started to lie to us one of my other friends lost it and went after him and tackled him down told him to quite lying. By the time he let him up and we all got back in are seats he started to spill his guts to us, he told us some rumers he started about us and some other things he did we kinda all lost it. So we calmed down a little then took turns talking to him, after my two friends talked it was my turn i was talking to him and he kept interupting me, finally i got mad and i grabed something off the floor to throw at him. Don't git me wrong not to hurt im to stop him from interupting me. I reached down grabed something soft without looking picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started to point and laugh, I stoped turned my head to look at what was in my hand. now remember it was an intense conversation you could cut the tension with a nife, for him to start laughing and everyone join in i didnt want to know. But i turned my head looked and fell over laughing it was a stuffed fairy i picked up off his floor i did through it at him, but playfully. We all finally stoped laughing and sat back down. I believe that it calmed us down enough to help exsplain and make things better for him and all of us. the moral of the story is even though your mad something will always make you smile and make your day better ..Tell me am I a sinner?.War is money, war is power,   Blood is the river of the century..Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go   Gee, Ma, I wanna go home   Oh, the soldiers in the

" Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2.....  It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION2, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS1 points out there's no more sugar. She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no lables on them. ""I think its the the jar on the left"", she said. I grab the jar on the left side without another word.  Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS1 and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Imidiately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in there mouths'. Suddenly my @LOCATION1 makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty..... not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers. She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of no where everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happend with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter is real. First, I was with my @CAPS1. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION1's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakeably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop imidiately and take the time to have a laugh.  .(refrain).(ooh)   'Cause at the end of the day you could just walk away,   When you find what you want isn't even the thing you need..Late that night I awoke from My sleep   Hearing unknown voices laughing   Insane   Grandma' was one, Oh it's coming   From the room next to mine   It's Grandma' room... the invisible   Guests   As I stood there alone in the dark   Peeking through the keyhole, couldn't   Believe My eyes   I'd never seen anything like it, only   Grandma' was inside the room   Speaking to no one... the invisible   Guests   Cups were rising in thin air and then   Emptied on the floor   Suddenly the door was open and   Grandma' said   ""Do come in My little friend""   Missy and Mother were sleeping   Downstairs   If they could see me in Grandmother's   Chair               Grandmother said ""look Me deep in   The eyes   You will forget what You saw here   Tonight""   ""I will let You in on the secret of this   House   The secret of Amon... that's what we   Call this house   Now I want you to go back to sleep,   Now go back to sleep My dear""   The invisible guests               Cups were rising in thin air and then   Emptied on the floor   Suddenly the door was open and   Grandma' said   ""Now you must go back to sleep""   ""Go to sleep""...

" Laughter--as we all know @CAPS4--is a visual expression of happiness, or in inward feeling of joy. @CAPS4 @MONTH1 insure from telling a joke, being tickled, or from some other random stimuli. @CAPS4 is in most cases, a very pleasant sensation. By that means, laughing has an enormous impact on each and every one of us throughout our everyday lives. Laughter tends to enlighten our emotions by expressing them in many good, cheerful, and lastly, positive ways. However, @CAPS4 is proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze.When laughter is shared, @CAPS4 binds people together and increases the intimacy and happiness. Around @TIME1--which happens to be exactly when my third period class begins, I was supposed to be in my @CAPS1 class at the time, but with my luck--I wasn't. You are probably thinking, ""@CAPS2, if she is not in her third period class, then where is she?"" I actually ended up in the computer lab, beginning my state writing test once again. I defiantly wasn't too thrilled about taking the writing test over again, but in my heart, I knew deep down inside that I could pass the state writing test this time without any if, and, or buts, which are also known as the worst things ever--excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could of done better--that's for sure. My self confidence was set to an exceedingly high standard with absolutely no negatives thoughts to think of. I was ready to face the test--once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost nearly sat down as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took an immense deep breath--like usual, and began to log into the computer. In between the time I was waiting for my computer to get logged in, I sat there gazing around the room, with nothing more to do, then to visualize what I was going to type my state writing test about. Once the teacher approved my log-in, I started typing all of my private information into the blank squares, so that I could begin my next steps.Within seconds I was ready to begin my test. On the screen appeared several topics that were listed below to choose from, but there was only one of them that I felt most satisfied with, and that I felt I could score exceedingly high in. The topic was, ""We all understand the benefits of laughter. For example, someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was on element or part.""  The minute I selected that subject, I honestly had no idea what I was going to write about because during my childhood life I had numerous laughter moments that had occurred, and nearly every story that I could remember had to of been more than @NUM1 words. So, I quietly sat there thinking-- just how I knew I would be.  During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which was the from the many taps from the kid's keyboards, and numerous annoying clicks from the computer mouses. @CAPS4 was very obvious that the students understood their topic quite @CAPS2--unlike me.  Minutes had flew by so quickly, and yet, still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. By then, I was very upset with myself, because if you really think about @CAPS4, who does not have a story to write about that deals with laughter? I knew I had some sort or kind of story to share, @CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one up and type about @CAPS4.  Just then, as I was going to begin my essay, a younger student, (that had been taking a state reading test), loudly shouted, ""@CAPS3!"" The little kid not only caught myself, but the rest of the class as @CAPS2. I honestly swear @CAPS4 was a ""had to of been there moments."" @CAPS4 wasn't just for the fact that he said @CAPS3 exceedingly loud, but the expression that was on his face, and the way he announced @CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab--@CAPS4 nearly killed me inside. The little boy was so thrilled and proud of himself that he had passed. Obviously he was very eager to let the entire class know--which is probably something I would have done as @CAPS2.  Almost as quickly as he announced @CAPS4, I knew this was a laughing moment to not only remember, but to share with others as @CAPS2. In fact, if truth be told, this short story just so happened to not only make my day, but he had made my state writing assessment topic many times less stressing for me. Clearly as you can see, laughing indeed does seem to have an enormous impact on each and everyone of us throughout our everyday lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared..You wake up in the middle of   The thunder of a scream   And you realise that it was yours   You don't know what to tell them   'Cause you don't know where you've been   And you've been late so many times before      It's only natural to feel like you're sinking   It's only human to be so unprepared      Don't worry baby   If you get a little high   It's just a phase to get you through   Getting by   So you get a little restless   And you get a little wasted   It's just a little light entertainment   Embrace it   It might just save your life      You always say you're sorry   But you never know what for   And it's been happening more and more   Act your age and not your shoe size   And blah blah blah blah blah   That's your role model      Slammin' the door      So it's only natural to feel   The guilt of a nation   It's only human when your young   You're gonna cry      Don't worry baby   If you get a little high   It's just a phase to get you through   Getting by   So you get a little restless   And you get a little wasted   It's just a little light entertainment   Embrace it   It might just save your life      So where else can you go to   Cause no one's given you the book   About what to say and how to feel   And what you should and shouldn't have took   It's feelings that your fearing   That's why you step outside your mind      Don't look back   'Cause if you don't crack

caverns that the breeze has kissed      Drawn inside, you hear a tone   As each foot hits a stepping stone   The music soothes and calms your mood   But suddenly you're not alone      A single cloud within a storm   Descends and leaves behind a form   Someone that you knew appears in front of you   A woman's figure, rain-cloud-born      She blinks but doesn't see you yet   She shivers and is

There are a lot of times where laughter was the biggest part of our friendship. But @CAPS3 not sure if we just think were funny or if people think were funny. My two best @CAPS2 are @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2. I've actually know both of them since we were little. It was about second grade when we became @CAPS2. Although we were never really close until about sixth grade. Now days @CAPS3 closer @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, then I am to @LOCATION1. I remember when @LOCATION2 and I would throw little pieces of eraser at each other across the room nearly missing our teacher. The first memory I remember @CAPS1 @PERSON2 was maybe when we were in third grade. We would goof off and mess around in @LOCATION3. The three of us haven't hangout a lot since high school started. It also doesn't help when we each go to different schools. But when @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and I do hangout were always laughing and having a good time. One example of laughter bringing us together, is when we went to @PERSON1 skate park for my birthday a few years back. @PERSON2's grandma was taking us there and along the way we asked if we could stop and get @ORGANIZATION1. I just got an @CAPS4 camera for my birthday so I decided to bring that along. We went the the @ORGANIZATION1's located on @NUM1 street. As we were going through the drive-thru and @PERSON2's grandma was ordering. @PERSON2 decided to roll his window down and started ordering stuff for himself at the same time his grandma was. He asked for a @ORGANIZATION2 and a large fry. What made this really funny was that his grandma was getting mad. She told @PERSON2 to stop and told the person over the mic not to listen to the male voice in the background. But @PERSON2 kept doing it anyways. When we were pulling up to the window to get the food @PERSON2 told his grandma to pull up far enough so he could get the food. So as we were pulling up @PERSON2 rolled his window up down and got the food. @CAPS3 so glad I brought my camera and recorded the whole thing. When we got there we hopped out of the car and went to the park. It was later in the day when we got there, probably about three or four. At first none of us really skated cause we were looking around. But when we did start skating we stayed there for about four or five hours. Cause when we left it was dark outside. There are four stair sets there, the two stair, the three stretch, the three block and the five stair. That's the order they go in from size and how hard it is to @PERSON3 them. Cause we were there for so long we had a lot of videos recorded. Some where of us skating, some where really random and funny, then others I don't know what the heck was going on in them. Later that day when we were tired and bored of being there @PERSON2's grandma came and picked us up. They both came over to my house when we got back. We just watched @CAPS5 and played video games. Its always funny to watch one of us get frustrated because were not winning. Eventually we stopped and listened to music. Around @NUM2 p.m @PERSON2 went home and @LOCATION2 stayed the @TIME1. As we were in my living room he was messing around @CAPS1 the tri-pod I had got @CAPS1 my camera. As he has it in his hands, he's unscrewing it and it falls apart. We both laught at first but then I got mad cause I just got that. This day was really fun, it was full of laughing, dedication to skating, and our friendship. It was a day that I felt closer to @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2.  .The moronic musical onslaught continues to insult   The intelligence of the savvy consumer..Ahh, hoping to find what's mine,   So I can lead a full life,   Use a knife,   And dig in like a cannibal..Yeah!.Longer   Than always is a long, long time,   But far beyond forever,   You'll be mine..As I walk down this busy street   I think about your leaving   How my life may never be the same   I know I should be planning ways   To enjoy this endless freedom   Losing you has put my heart in chains..Way back when in sixty-seven   I was the dandy   Of Gamma Chi   Sweet things from Boston   So young and willing   Moved down to Scarsdale   And where the hell am I      Hey Nineteen   No we can't dance together   No we can't talk at all   Please take me along   When you slide on down      Hey Nineteen   That's 'Retha Franklin   She don't remember the Queen of Soul   It's hard times befallen   The Soul Survivors   She thinks I'm crazy   But I'm just growin' old      Hey Nineteen   No we got nothin' in common   No we can't talk at all   Please take me along   When you slide on down      The Cuervo Gold   The fine Colombian   Make tonight a wonderful thing      We can't dance together   No we can't talk at all.Wisdom not pride, give innocence instead..I see them dancing somewhere in the moonlight   Somewhere in Alaska, somewhere in the sun   I hear them singing a song for all lovers   A song for the two hearts beating only as one      Imagine the morning no longer alone   The arms of another, a place to belong   No longer the struggle, no longer the night   And ever becoming in the quickening light      To see the darkness, to listen within   To answer in kindness, to ever begin   To ever be gentle, to always be strong   To walk in the wonder, to live in the song      In a place of enchantment where the wild things are known   Will the future remember when the lovers are gone?.I'm falling down   And I can't get up again      Do ya, do ya, do ya   Do ya, do ya, do ya      Mother Mary, is there nothing you can do?.Ho!).Where you At Rock?.Standin' on top of my hill   How do ya'll know what it feels like   How can you tell me to make my bed   When I sleep on the ground   How can you say that you like my noise   When I haven't made a sound   I like peace time better than war   Spendin' my money in the candy store   I like makin' angels on the shore   How do ya'll know      Floatin' on my cloud   How do ya'll know what it feels like   Yellin your sermon from the bottom of a glass   'Cause you know how it's done   Tellin' me the troubles of the promised land   When I'm in it just for fun   I like to eat my pie before my meal   Make a snake with an orange peel   Say my prayers before I kneel   How do ya'll know      When I was walkin' past your house   I didn't see nobody home   Ya'll musta been out buyin' gold   When I was polishin' chrome   Ridin' in my spaceship   How do ya'll know what it feels like   What makes you think you can navigate   When you don't know where I'm flyin   Tellin' me the facts about what I say   When you don't even know if I'm lyin'      I like to wear white in the wintertime   Pay my penance before the crime   Have my reason without the rhyme   But how do ya'll know.I've been searching trying to find you""   I couldn't speak   My hands reached for Martha's foolish ginger   We talked until the moon came up   About how life without love   Isn't worth very much   Then I played this song      If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland   Who knows what I would have done   If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland   Who knows what I would have done   What I would have done   What I would have done      ""Memories that we have yet"" you said   ""To make like our Burning Bed...""

" Laughing at @CAPS1 bell. @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together. We are always laughing about something even if @CAPS7's something completely stupid or actually really funny. We laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things. Also we laugh at funny things we do. @CAPS8 one thing that has always stuck to @CAPS11 head, the time at @CAPS1 bell. One day after school, me and @CAPS11 best friend @PERSON1 decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @CAPS1 bell. We ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @CAPS7. A few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @CAPS7. ""@CAPS4"" I said to @LOCATION1 as i took a bite of @CAPS11 @CAPS5 five layer burrito. ""@CAPS6""@CAPS7 was really hot and burned @CAPS11 mouth. I had to wait for a few minuets to eat @CAPS11 burrito. So we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives. A couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. Meanwhile I thought @CAPS11 burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head. Next thing i knew @CAPS11 burrito was coming out of @CAPS11 mouth and I was dieing of laughter.  @CAPS11 burrito was spit completely out of @CAPS11 mouth, and all over me an @LOCATION1. All over @CAPS11 hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table. I was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @CAPS8 to laugh. I think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @CAPS8 wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think this was the end of @CAPS11 bad day, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 only gets worse. Eating @CAPS11 burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever. @CAPS7 probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. Meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a small drink and get some @CAPS10. As i was returning to @CAPS11 table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line. I almost spilled @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS8 luckily I didn't. Returning to @CAPS11 seat i was talking to @PERSON1 about how bad @CAPS11 day was, and how @CAPS7 couldn't get any worse. Then i took a drink an I started to choke on @CAPS11 @CAPS10, @CAPS7 was so bad that i spit everything out onto @LOCATION1, @CAPS10 went flying everywhere, @CAPS7 even came out of @CAPS11 noes. So i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @CAPS11 self up, caught @CAPS11 breath, and told @PERSON1 i was ready to go home. When i look back and think about the day at @CAPS1 bell with @CAPS11 best friend, I not only think about how embarrassing @CAPS7 was for me and her, @CAPS8 also that @CAPS7 was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @CAPS11 life. As i said before @CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday..Go, go!.Got a lot at stake, and a promise to make   And a kiss from your lips could seal it      [Chorus]   I'll be there, for you babe   I'll be the one that you need   I'll be the man that will love you   I'll be there, for you babe      Another loose nut, pain in your gut   Relationship gone down   In a bottle of booze, you manifest your blues   Put on your face and hit the town   Now that skin-tight dress maybe might impress   The kind of man that you might not like   First time up with no luck and confusion   Got you gamblin' with just one strike   You need more than conversation and introduction calls   You need someone to catch you when you fall   And fly like an eagle when you fine   Cause you on my mind      [Chorus]      Look at how she sway, look at how she move   Tryin' to show and prove, don't disturb the groove   She got - hazel eyes, and hair that's gold   An amazing heart, and an angel's soul   She used to be a sinner, but now she's saved   She's well respected and she's well behaved   Her fuse is short, her legs are long   Her temper's mean, her will is strong   A love so real, a love so deep   A love so true, it's so hard to keep   Her center's sweet, her beauty's rare   When we walk down the street people stop and stare   She's so damn smart, she's one of a kind   She's a work of art, she's a priceless wine   She's a drama queen, she's a friend of mine   She's every man's dream and she's mine all mine      [Chorus].Dan:   Tell me who to be      Gabe:   Look at me..We lie awake, this wall between us   We're just not talking, we've got so much to say   Let's break these chains, our love can free us   Oh, ain't it time we started trying   Oh, gotta stop this love from dying      How can we be lovers if we can't be friends?.And I won't let my heart control my head..If I can ever lose my blues..I still have your memory..I'm

We're watching the world pass us by   Never want to come down   Never want to put my feet back down   On the ground   I'm taking a ride   With my best friend   I hope he never lets me down again   Promises me I'm as safe as houses   As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers   I hope he never lets me down again   Never let me down   See the stars they're shining bright   Everything's

" Boy says too @CAPS2:@CAPS1 weigh?, @CAPS2: what? Boy:@CAPS3 i just wanted too say something to break the ice!Laughter is the greatest thing too have in any kind of relationship, such as family, friends, and a romantic type relationship. It bring each other great bondage and makes the relationship playful.It was @DATE1 and i was on my way too pick up a long time no see friend too go to a warped tour concert. We haven't been in the greatest terms because of an issue that was upon us a few months ago. I figure to take my friend @CAPS4 to a concert shes been wanting to go too all year long. When we finally picked her up there was all sorts of tension of unleft said words to each other, but i wasn't gonna wait any longer too see what was about too happen.Before we headed too the concert my parents decided too get a car wash, @CAPS5 then i automatically thought of a few funny things i could do to make her laugh. The car moved as slow as a turtle into the car wash machine. I had left the window crack open to were enough water would crawl in. We were kinda talking about the concert and i had looked very unaware that my window was open, i actually had too no idea that a lot more of water then i expect had came in. She looked across at me and was like laughing so hard see couldn't even speck of what was happening. I looked at her and was like what? She was your windows open and i had turned and came too find water was rushing its way down and sorta frightened me and i jumped into the air and rushed too close the window. She was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was i. From that moment on it was such an ice breaker for all the tension that was happening. the elephant had left or side and we had a great rest of the day. See, it true""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". When laughter is happening no one is truly sad, mad or anything else. Laughter can bring too people who just meet good greetings, too couples closer together, friend and family joy and happiness. Laughter is truly the key to happiness. .I can't imagine that their minds are thinking the same like me   I can hear the grass grow, I can hear the grass grow   I see rainbows in the evening      My

their faith in oaken doors, cower in candlelight   The panic seeps through bloodstained floors as Grendel stalks the night      Earth rim walker seeks his meals   Prepare the funeral pyres   The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear   Within their eyes, their eyes      Wooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea   Appeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviour born of dreams   They know their lives are forfeit now, priestly head they bow in shame   They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel's name      Earth rim walker seeks his meals   Prepare the funeral pyres   The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear   Within their eyes, their eyes      As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere   Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear   He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify   His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky      Earth rim walker seeks his meals   Prepare the funeral pyres   The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear   Within their eyes, their eyes      Silken membranes span his path, fingerprints in dew   Denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through   Mother nature's bastard child shunned by leaf and stream   An alien in an alien land seeks solace within dreams   The shaper's lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp   Beguiling queen her innocence offends his icy heart      Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell   Sulphurous essence pervades round the grassy dell   Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher's knife   Stellular heavens ignore even children's cries      Screams are his music, lightning his guide   Raping the darkness, death by his side      Chants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams   Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene   Warriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe   Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know      Heroes delusion, with feet in the grave   Lurker at the threshold, he cares not for the brave, he cares not for the brave      So you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out   You should have known better after all this time   You're gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander   With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes   Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame   God's on my side, sure as hell, I'm gonna take no blame   I'm gonna take no blame, I'm gonna take no blame      So you say you believe in all of Mother Nature's laws   You lust for gold with your sharpened knives   Oh when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot   You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods      Then you try to place the killer's blade in my hand   You call for justice and distort the truth   Well I've had enough of all your pretty pretty speeches   Receive your punishment, Expose your throats to my righteous claws   And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow, flow, flow, flow..Love me or leave me   Make your choice but believe me   I love you   I do, I do, I do, I do, I do      I can't conceal it   Don't you see?.I wake as I have always done,   To freshly scented sycamore   And cold bare feet on hardwood floor..You act so convinced,   A fortress you've built..Oh, can't you see that time is the key that will unlock the destiny   Of we three?.You've got the way to make it all happen..Left school with a first class pass,   Started work but as second class..It's enough to make you cry   Thinking 'bout the love gone by..So don't tell me about a fake drug war   Go cut education programs more   The people will one day learn and rise   Cause not everyone is out to score."
" I think that laughter is a key element to any lasting relationship, because if you didnt have laughter then that would be one boring relationship. Let me share with you a personal story of my own.  I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is @CAPS1. We first met here at school and then he transfered and moved away, then a few months ago he added me on facebook and we started talking again. At the time we had started talking he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again he realized that she was not the one for him anymore. It was rough for him to break up with her but he did it and i am proud of him, becuase she treated him very bad.  In the beggining of our relationship we were both really shy and didnt talk much but the more and more that we hang out the more we start talking. We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts. Everytime i see him i get really nervous and it almost seeems as if my heart skips a beat. Whenever we are walking down a street i cannot help but to smile. And when we lay on the cowtch and watch movies i can't help but to laugh when he tickles me. We laugh at each other all the time, wether its when one of us makes a mistake or what not. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong. Everytime he leaves i cannot wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it i feel like it would be a really boing and if it is boring than you wouldn't want to spend time with one another. I personally think that every moment with your significant other should be fully taken advantage of..Burn!.Where are you?.Baby, love is tough but we can make it   Baby, times are rough but we can make it   We can work it out      How can we be lovers if we can't be friends?.The missionary man he was followin' me..Mmm...sound like why might be choking on something did you say you want some more?.I

" They say laughter is the best kind of medicine their is. So to tell you the truth on that qoate I will tell you a true story on laughter and how its a medicine. I already have recognized in believing it my self. I also will explain its key element in part of the world. So to start us off I will tell you a story that has laughter in which fixed a few ed between my grandpa @CAPS1 and my cousin @PERSON1. To start off it had happened about some time during the @DATE1. We were all having a blast. There was my cousins @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and his little brother @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and I. So @PERSON2, @PERSON4 and I were minding are business playing games while our grandpa was watching us play and then out of no were we here a loud smack and then crying and screaming. So it had turned out that @PERSON1 ""slipped"" and smacked @PERSON3 who is only seven years old.Then our grandpa starts yelling and trying to figure out what the heck went down. After seeing @PERSON3's back with a big red hand mark on it that's when grandpa really let loose and just started going ballistic all over @PERSON1 but then @PERSON1 went home all piste. So later on @PERSON1 came back and then grandpa and I sat at the table talking to him. That's when I mentioned something that started to make every one laugh so hard that they all forgot what happened then he said sorry to @PERSON3 and we were all happy by the time grandma got home from work.So to conclude my story I wish to remind you on why laughter is an element or if it plays a part in something which was a true story in part of my life.

a hole in your soul like an animal   With no conscience, repentance, oh no   Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise   Devils feed on the seeds of the soul      I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real   No mistaking the faking, I care   With a prayer in the air I will leave it there   On a note full of hope not despair      [Chorus: x2].Everytime you think you've paid the price,   Seems you've always got to pay it twice..While shepherds watch their flocks by night,   They see a bright new shining star,   They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar..(chorus)   It's over now   It's over now   I feel like I can make it   The storm is over now   (verse 1 boy)   It's over now   It's over now   I feel like I can make it   The storm is over now

"Most people think that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and show who you really are. I believe all of that is true, laughter is one of the most important things a person can do. In my life laughter has helped me threw the hardest situations and made them a lot better. You can laugh a lot with friends, family, or people you barely even know. Laughing can mend relationships and help you get threw anything, in my life i have found that out many times.My mother and myself haven't always had the best relationship, we don't always get along, and since i have a severe separation anxiety from her we spend a lot of time together which can cause friction from being together too much. There was a certain time when we had just gotten into a fight about me wanting to go somewhere and her not letting me, i was expecting her to be mad at me for awhile for how rude i was being. We didn't talk for a couple hours and tried to stay away from each other, we would only talk to each other if it was really important. After a couple days of this going on i went into her room to talk to her about it all, when we talked i understood why she was so mad at me and i apologized and left her room, but i could still feel that there was some tension between us. I wanted to make things better more then i have ever wanted anything, i wasn't really sure if she was ready to get over this fight, so i thought it would be better to give her some space and let her come to me when she was ready to talk. We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day trying to cool off and really think about what we were truly mad about. The next day we went to go do somethings around town, some grocery shopping and to see some family. In the beginning we didn't really talk much or anything. Within an hour of us leaving the house and having our alone time together we were joking around and laughing at everything each other said. After our errands we went out to lunch, it was the funnest time i had ever had with my mom, we talked about everything and laughed and had an amazing time. The days after that were wonderful also, we spent a lot of time together and felt like we didn't want to leave each other, i know that laughing together and talking really helped with that, we opened up to each other like we never had before. I love my mother and care for her more then anyone in the world, when we got into that fight i was scared out relationship would never be the same again, we were able to work it out by laughing. I honestly think that laughter can cure anything, from a broken heart to a broken family..It's a strange song   'Bout a boy who went wrong   Who tried to make it up   Inside his heart and start again   To make a manse      For livin' his strange life   He's never made a change life   Until one day he found himself alone   With only him   And oh how dim his future seemed      On that day   He searched to find a better way to be a man   And as he tried   He cast away his foolish pride   And I understand      His strange song   Then he came a sing along   Where every note was just a proper one   To hum and sing and have a thing   That's groovy with      On that day   He searched to find a better way to be a man   And as he tried   He cast away his foolish pride   And I understand      His strange song   Then he came a sing along   Where every note was just a proper one   To hum and sing and have a thing   That's groovy with.Dealin' with your troubles drove me away..Taken for granted and pushed aside,   All that it wanted was a place to run and hide..healing both you and me   (May I?).If you feel like you've been hated,   This love's too overrated, see what's going on, on      And darling, don't be nervous   I'll understand if you'll let me go   I did this on purpose now      And when I'm missing you, I'll stop eating food   And I'll squeeze into a dress so I can be like you   And then I'll see your bitterness and why you're leaving too   Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'   I think that I love you      Take me back to live at home   And take me back to Albert Road      Now I'm missing you, I've stopped eating food   And I've squeezed into your dress so I can feel like you   But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too   I thought I'd put you to a test and say that 'I love you'   I think that I love you      And I've stopped eating food   And I've squeezed into your dress so I could feel like you   But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too   Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'   Now it seems you loved me too.I know you locked the door, boy let me in!.Love show me the way when I am lost and hope begins   To fade   Love timeless and true whenever   I need strength   I look to you   Tonight my faith is strong enough to see me through   Tonight you've got to trust in love the way I do   We gotta hold on tight-tonight   Hold on -

"                   @DATE2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was a warm day, and @CAPS3 and I were on our way to my family reunion, in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2. Our car was crammed, and with my mom, grandma, cousin, and us two girls, @CAPS2 got really hot. @CAPS2 was about the @NUM1 of @DATE1, in @DATE3. I swear I thought we were all going to die in that car! We had the air conditioning on, but @CAPS2 didn't help much, I was in the middle of my cousin, @CAPS4, and @CAPS3. We finally got to a rest stop, and we all kinda stumbled out of the car. @CAPS3 wanted to go get a drink, so I followed. I'm pretty sure we were getting weird looks from all the people around us at this point. I was in my @LOCATION1 @CAPS6's, and @CAPS3 was in @CAPS8 @CAPS9. @CAPS2 felt like @CAPS2 had taken @NUM2 minutes to just walk to the drinking fountain. @CAPS2 was really that hot. I opened a cliff bar, while @CAPS3 was getting a drink. That is when I heard her scream. Of course, I busted up laughing, even though I didn't know what had happened. @CAPS3 turned around, and that laughter, turned to hysterical screaming. The mouth thing on the fountain had been turned towards you when you drink, so @CAPS3 was drenched. I sarcastically said, ""@CAPS12, you won't be hot for a while now will ya?"" We both laughed, and she chased me, trying to get me soaked. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh together. Later that day, when we finally reached the family reunion, they had a pool. She tried to push me in, but I took her with me. Everyone was laughing at that point. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, than I did last @DATE2. Those were good times..But I still haven't found (No-no!).Oh!.Black Rage is founded: who fed us self hatred,   Lies and abuse while we waited and waited?.I'm not gonna give it up for free anymore   And I don't really care if you label me a whore   Frayed at the edges, busted at the seams   I can walk with a song, sleep with my dreams      You can cover up your chains, and call yourself free   It doesn't really matter,   It's all the same to me      You're the new newest thing and we've seen it all before   In fact I've seen it many times and I'll see it many more   You know it won't last, you know it never does   But better to be a has-been than to be a never-was   You can get out with it clean or prolong the agony   Which ever you prefer,   It's all the same to me      You worship the future like it's some kind of saint   But it's just like the past with a new coat of paint   Try to save a world that doesn't want to be saved   Stolen like a child, the one you think is misbehaved   You can say what you want or say what you see   You can say nothing, its all the same to me.Don't you see   Don't you see   All these things now days   Come in short supply   It's time that we   It's time that we   Make a space in our hearts   And open our eyes   Or there'll be no more you      There'll be no more me   There'll be no more children   All we know will cease to be   Don't you see   Don't you see   The things of this earth   Keep us alive   It's time that we      It's time that we   Make a space in our hearts   And open our eyes   Where are the sunny days?.Played by the gate at

sense of pain      A thousand tides, and   A thousand waves   Takin' it all away      And it'll come back in   We'll be gone by then, oh   And it's a miracle we ever learned to give.Los Vegaz)

sunshine's cold   Man, I do mean COLD   Then our interstellar stallions sailed through the starless void   There was nothing to miss in that emptiness, not even a stray asteroid   So we picked up the trail of a comet tail, man, you can't even DREAM that far   And the galloping beat like the rhythm of an old catgut guitar   Just the strummin' of a distant star   Yippie-aye-ay-e   Well, it could have lasted minutes or a hundred thousand years   When they got me down, I was safe and sound and it hadn't even popped my ears   And they reared back on their broncos and they shot a bolt of light

 A man came in with a violin   He played for me like I've never been   Courted before and forevermore   As the bow touched the strings   He made the whole world sing   Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you

singing songs in the night   Have taken me far away and mystified   The songs of the lovers brought tears to my eyes   The words that you'd spoken made me realize.Do you like it naughty, do you like it nice?.Up!.Why was I hiding out?.You saw divine cleopatra,   You know what 'came of her..Guess I wasn't the best one to ask   Me myself with my face pressed   Up against love's glass   To see the shiny toy I've been hoping for   The one I never could afford   The wide world spins and spits turmoil   And the nations toil for peace   But the paws of fear upon your chest   Only love can soothe that beast   And my words are paper tigers   No match for the predators of pain inside her      I say love will come to you   Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true   As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through   Where there's now one there will be two      I was born under the sign of cancer   (Love will come to you)   Like brushing cloth I smooth the wrinkles for an answer   (Love will come)   I'm always closing my eyes and wishing I'm fine   (I close my eyes and wish you fine)   Even though I know I'm not this time   (Even though I know your not this time)      I say love will come to you   Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true   As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through   Where there's now one there will be two      Dodging your memories a field of knives   Always on the outside looking in on other's lives      I say love will come to you   Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true   As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through   (I have offered up to you)   Where there's now one there will be two      And I wish her insight to battle love's blindness   Strength from the milk of human kindness   A safe place for all the pieces that scattered   Learn to pretend there's more than love that matters.I want to take you down   I want to take you down   I want to take you right down   I....The coyote call, and the howlin' winds wail..And the grass grew high and the feathers floated by   I stood and held your hand..Walk on, talk on,   Baby tell no lies..Shooby-dooby-doo-wap      Since that metallic stage..Ain't no golden gates gonna swing open   Ain't no streets paved in natural pearl   Ain't no angel with a harp come singin'   Leastways not that I know of in this world      In these days of uncertain futures   Who knows what the masters might do   They got their big deals goin' on, goin' on   Got nothing to do with me and you      If I could I'd get us a big suite   Overlooking the park   Only promise I know to be true   Are the promises made from the heart      I don't need to see the whole thing go down   I don't need to see another lonely man   I don't need to see a woman crying for the savior   Holding on to some moneyman's hand      Who can I call to make my reservations   Forever thrown in the dark   The only promises I know to be true   Are the promises made from the heart      I don't believe in the authorities   They ain't gonna take care of me and you   I don't have all the strength that I need   To love the way that I want to      The only promises I know to be true   Are the promises made from the heart.Truth be known, you're dyin', cryin', lyin' there in bed..Head to head,   Gun to gun,   Now we're gonna,   Have some fun."
"                                    Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 For the @ORGANIZATION1 is a very important thing in life , I personally could not live without laughter in my life I honestly could not do it. I would not be me if I didn't have laughter in my life . All relationships should have laughter involved in some way ,what would a relationship be without laughter! Laughter is a beautiful thing , when I am laughing I am enjoying life in in my own way and my worries instantly go away and some how I feel like I am ""carefree "" . Laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally . Through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships . But let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad.   I have always been very close to my dad , you might even say I am a daddy's little girl .Laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad. It somehow always found its way into our relationship. The @CAPS1 times of laughter are what I valued and treasured so much that whenever I think about it I cant help but smile . I remember when I was little if I ever needed a @CAPS1 laugh my dad was the person to call . The laughter grew stronger through out the years , I cannot recall a time where my dad and I had a moment where laughter was not involved . We always used to watch these @CAPS3 shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard .We would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family ,sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing it would just happen . I can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and I oh how I miss those @CAPS1 @NUM1 nights were what I looked forward to, I knew that I would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces . I looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing ,oh what @CAPS1 times those were . Since my dad moved to @LOCATION1 ,we haven't had those beautiful times of laughter that I miss so much, but I can always treasure them in my heart. Those moments of laughter were the best moments I have ever had with my dad,since I was little girl till now almost an adult . I don't know if my dad and I would be as close today if we hadn't had all that laughter throughout our lives. Whenever I am sad or miss my dad , I go back to those times we had filled with laughter, and listen to his laugh playing in my head. I never knew how important laughter would be to me. I am glad laughter played such an important part in my life. Laughter is such an important part of life/relationships because it brings joy and happiness. Laughter is the type of thing that no matter what , should always be a part of any relationship. I think laughter is healthy for our bodies, for example if you're sad ,depressed ,or just not having a @CAPS1 day a @CAPS1 laugh will change that and make you feel a lot better ,like it did for my dad and I. Laughter also makes relationships last longer , the reason why I am so close to my dad , best friend, mom, boy friend , sisters etc is because of laughter itself . If laughter was not involved in my relationships , I could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life. My dad is the reason why I laugh so much , he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple. I never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is.  Where I would be today without laughter I truly have no idea. My dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. If laughter was not involved in any relationship , the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles,can you imagine having no laughter at all! I certainly cant imagine life without laughter. If my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact , we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today. What do you think about laughter? Has laughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships?  .Whoa no no no!.Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour   Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us   Sanctus Espiritus!.'Cause the Lord will take it all on judgment day,   And the Lord will take it all on judgement day..He watched me change from boys to boys   And now I am his size..Roll out down to midnight

conceived,   I will turn my focus to you..I can see that look that says beware   Try to move in closer if you dare   So I must sit and play   My waiting game   And for a while I know   She'll do the same   Fly away      Watches like an eagle from its eyrie   And like a bird of prey   She captures me   But I am older and   More wise than you   Bird of prey   Straight into me you flew   Fly away      Now every time I tried to set her free   I'm glad to say she comes   Right back to me   But if I knew she didn't want to stay   I wouldn't try to keep that   Lovely bird of prey.Could we get back up beneath, eventually love?.She signed the letter      ""All yours,   Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!.Where can you be?.I believe in mistakes and accidents   That the nature of life is chaos and confusion   That man's rules of law and order   May not stand      And I should be and be not afraid   To reach for heaven      I may think that I know   The true heart's needs   But my pride may bring me low   Unable to see   I'm no closer than yesterday   But tomorrow I may stand      And be and be not afraid   To reach for heaven      I'll see the black car cavalcade   Lights on in the morn   I'll run fast and far away   I'll run without stopping   Til hear and feet fail   Or until I can stand      And be and be not afraid      Be and be not afraid   Be and be not afraid   To reach for heaven.Well goodbye world   It's sad but true   Got a date with the hangman   I have to leave you   I shot my darlin'   Three times of more   The reason I'm goin'   Is blood on the floor      The nights are so lonely   The days are so long   I'm in the jailhouse   'Cause they say I've done wrong   I don't say I'm sorry   I just say I'm sore   The reason I'm goin'   Is blood on the floor (blood on the floor)      Well I came home one night   She were lyin',   With her legs around   Another mans bod   She saw me, stared laughin'   But she cried, when she saw my gun      Goodbye world   I guess we must part   They're taking my life   'Cause I shot my sweetheart   I don't say I'm sorry   I just say I'm sore   The reason I'm goin'   Is blood on the floor   Oh the reason I'm goin'   Is blood on the floor   Oh the reason I'm goin'   Is the blood on the floor.She will moan the night away..Mighty waves come crashing down,   The spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye   Shrieking as it cuts the devil wind,   Is calling sailors to the deep   But I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear   Surf is high an' the sea is awash   An' a haze of candy floss, glitter and beads   Rock that we sat on and watched in the sun   That was hot to touch   And the sea was emerald green   I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear   And I can see you smile   Surf comes rushing up the beach   Now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall   Catfish dappled silver flashing   Dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep.Time will take your cruel power away   Do you hear me?.Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten..Ever tried to sleep around with a bed for a wife..THE SWORD OF THE GODS ..I see from look in your eyes, there's   Something I could never deny   For the first the first   After all this time   I found true love      I have never been so happy in my life   Till you finally showed me for the first time   I know this time I found true love      CHROUS   And I believe from the moment we met   Your love is truly as good as it is   That, once I let you go   I'll never be happy again      And I believe for the very first time   Your love is truly   Meant to be mine   And my heart knows once I let you go   I'll never be happy again      You gave me the reason to live, now   All I ever want is to give you all of me   Cause I believe you gave me true love      REPEAT CHORUS.Every time I hear a newborn baby cry,   Or touch a leaf   Or see the sky,   Then I know why I believe.Said you'd be there till the end   Now you're treatin' me like a cat   Flaps flap      You're a rock and salad roll   Born to lose control   You're livin' your life   On the edge of the bowl      Said you were a fool   How did you do that?.Blind stick blind drunk cannot see   Mouth dry tongue tied cannot speak   Concrete dream flesh broken shell   Lost soul lost trace lost in hell..Elements that I'm among,   these   none..I need someone to hold on to..Then it's me and my machine   For the rest of the morning,   For the rest of the afternoon   And the rest of my life..Show me that you love me and that we belong together..Just a one time thing..Love can move mountains..Reached out from inside   Someone on who he can depend   It's getting to late to recover   He won't stand a chance and into his own hell he'll descend   Don't descend   Don't descend   Don't descend   Don't descend      No understanding of things we already know   He has to live his life and just learn how to let go   Alright yeah      Communication's an impossibility   His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy   The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head   I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead   C'mon yeah.Another day older and deeper in debt   Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go   I owe my soul to the company store      I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine   I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine   I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal   And the straw boss said ""Well, bless my soul""      I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain   Fightin' and trouble are my middle name   I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion   And no high-toned woman make me walk the line      If you see me comin', better step aside   A lotta men didn't and a lotta men died   One fist of iron, the other of steel   If the right one don't get you then the left one will.[Chorus]   I've been higher than the high sierra   Lower than death valley must be   I've been right, mostly wrong   Wrong about you, right about me      The way I feel, can't explain   So much passion turned to pain   The sun still shines most of the time   Did you know the sun shines when it rains      [Chorus]      I've been cussed and I've been praised   And I've been nothing these days   But I'll come back, time will see   If I'm wrong about you, right about me      [Chorus].Oh      (I will fight in this life   Defying the coldest wars   It's always been like this   But don't know why)      No   Screaming at the walls of fire   Frozen into me   Hunted for the vertical sealed before that   It's where I wanna be   Screaming at the walls of fire   I'm still running free   In the silver moonlight   I can't breathe   Woo   (Your fear will chain you down)      Till I know a little rain   Care about the day your heart breaks up   When you lose your way.But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light."
" I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a class room, or even form a book. I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room. One @MONTH1 be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon.  In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background. I was in my third period class; which was leadership at the time. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice @MONTH1 give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the class room in order to do what needed to be done that day. Leadership directly preceded myleast favorite class of the day, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I simply detested that class. I had been in @CAPS1 classes ever since I was in kindergarten at @ORGANIZATION1. I was a sophomore at the time and that language had been bugging me for the past ten years. It wasn't that I was bad at it or anything because really, I wasn't. I just had a strong contempt for @CAPS1 class. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and I tended to talk a lot. She was that type of person who had @CAPS10 posture and was a stickler for the rules. The the type of person you could see wielding a yard stick as a deadly weapon.  In leadership that specific class period, the teacher was taking a particularly long time explaining what we were supposed to do that day. He sometimes did this, he was famous for being long winded. He could take the entire @NUM1 minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to do. That day however, we weren't doing an assignment. At least not what a normal person would consider to be your typical assignment. Another girl from the class, @CAPS5; and myself were working on a special project. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot. As we were walking we passed by the office doors, the @CAPS6 hall, and the library. Just as we were about to walk by the copy room door, I saw @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was in my @CAPS1 Two class the year before and I thought that I would say hi to him. I did, I then asked if he was taking @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that year. He replied with a no. I told him, ""@CAPS10 thing, because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sucks!"" I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by the truck load in just a short while. Not five seconds after I had said that to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 was tugging on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told her to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they are talking.  After I had said bye to @PERSON2, @CAPS5 hurried me out the door and she burst into laughter. I was taken-aback by her sudden outburst of laughter and questioned her as to what she was laughing about. It was right then that @LOCATION1, my @CAPS1 teacher, poked her head out the door and said to me in her thick accent, ""@PERSON1, I hear you don't like my class!"" I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. The kind of look that jumps on your face when you wish you had a rewind button for your mouth. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @CAPS5 gasping for air because she was laughing so hard. I redirected my attention to @LOCATION1, she was just standing there with an angry face covering up the laughter that was trying to break through. There I was, not ten steps away from my car and I, for once, had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator teaches your next class. .I'm trying to be a person,   But they all say I'm worthless..Pickin' up the pieces   Is hard to do alone   And now your mind is set on stayin' free   I just want to hold you   Until the hurt is gone   Oh, that's close enough to love for me..Singin' too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay..Wind in my hair..And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach   That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep..You're perfect   Oh perfect      I just can't control myself   I can't be with no one else   It seems like I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me   I don't think they understand   Why love at your command from   The words you speak so deep   Our bodies read   I have to have you      [Chorus]   I love you   You're perfect   A manifestation of my dreams      You made my   Body feel   About a million different things      I think God made you for me   A mix of passionate fidelity   Baby you're so complete   I write this song to let you know   That you will always be to me   My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend   and my king      [Chorus]      There's no way   I'd leave you   It's just not a reality      Sometimes I   Feel like I'm   Livin' in a fantasy.[Verse 7]   Sadly my darling Matilda,   Caught a fever and it killed her..Hey baby, what's the deal?.[Chorus]   Then I hear you sweet voice (Dont worry)   Will you be there (In a hurry)   You know I've been hurt before (I see you)   Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)   Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry..Clear as crystal      Clear as crystal, I can see your face   In a glass of water, you can see your face   How do you feel know, I want to know   Now I can see you so crystal clear      Crystal clear.And Lord You know how very weak I am   I just can't hide it any more..Now when I first met you   I was rolling along,   Just a bar room crooner   Singing heartbreak songs,   An' I supposed I could never get next to you   But, you seemed quite happy with my company   You kept my body heat steady at 103,   With your mouth full of gimme   An' your body full of much obliged      It's bloody luxury   What you mean to me,   Bloody luxury   What you do to me   It's bloody luxury   What you mean to me,   'cause no matter what you do to me   It's bloody luxury   Bloody luxury      You're a five star woman,   An' you know what to give   To fill a part time loser   Full of reasons to live,   But, there's no doubt about it   I'm taking a chance on you   Becos' you get my heart beating heavy,   Make my knees go weak   You get me so damn nervous   I can hardly speak,   But, nothing's gonna stop me   Hanging on my good luck charm      It's bloody luxury   What you mean to me,   Bloody luxury   What you do to me   It's bloody luxury   What you mean to me,   'Cause no matter what you do to me   It's bloody luxury   Bloody luxury      It's bloody luxury   What you mean to me,   Bloody luxury   Honey what you do to me   It's bloody luxury   What you mean to me,   'Cause no matter what you do to me   It's bloody luxury      Bloody luxury   What you mean to me,   Bloody luxury   Honey what you do to me   It's bloody luxury   What you mean to me,   'Cause no matter what you do to me,   No matter what you do to me,   No matter what you do to me,   It's bloody luxury   Bloody luxury      Bloody luxury.Be Thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart   Nought be all else to me, save that Thy art   Thou my best thought in the day and the night   Waking or sleeping, Thou presence my light      Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true word   I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord   Thou my great Father and I Thy true son   Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one      Be Thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight   Be Thou my armor and be Thou my might   Thou my soul shelter, and Thy my high tower   Raise Thou me heavenwards, oh power of my power      Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise   Thou mine inheritance through all of my days   Thou and Thou only though first in my heart   High king of heaven my treasure Thou art      Oh high king of heaven, when battle is done   Grant heaven's joy to me, bright heaven sun   Christ of my own heart, whatever befall   Still be my vision, though ruler of all      Da, da, da, da, da,.I will hold Your people in my heart..We could have been so much better off   Than before if we held on true   I said but lately I've been feeling mighty old      I said the sun has got me cracked   And this wind has got me cold   And I'm so damn tired of losing my friends   Every single time I go and lose my ends      I say but that's okay, I'm on my way   And in awhile when I realize   There's something new   but until then i got to hold on true.Oh, didn't you like to do,   An uneasy thing to do?.(Whooo whoooo)   How do I end up in the same old place,   Faced again with the same mistakes,   So stubborn thinkin I know what is right,   But life proves me wrong everytime,   Takin roads that lead me nowhere,   How do I expect to get there,   But when will I learn to just put you first..(work, work)   With just a little bit of soul, now   (work!).Tell me, when you're there lying by his side..I said ""I got no money""..Well, I dreamed my end was near   I was almost gone   If I dream that dream from here   Can I still come home?.Spin that shit   Spin it till it's platinum..Tie a knot in the rope, trying to hold, trying to hold,   But there's nothing to grab so I let go..And I said, oh, whoa, whoa, honey, tell me why,   Why does every thing go wrong?.Oh, I am so upset!.Bye bye, pretty woman   I've got to leave you now   I find you never really cared      Stand back, take a look at you   You couldn't care if you wanted to   You keep saying it's gonna change   But every time it comes back again   It's a merry-go-round      Endless lies shine in your eyes      It's alright, count to ten   It will all be better then   It's alright, the world will go away      Stand back, take a look at you   You couldn't care if you wanted to   You keep saying it's gonna change   But every time it comes back again   It's a merry-go-round      Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes   The heartbreak is, if you could only see   That's not the way it's supposed to be   Endless tears that flowed through the years   You take it all, and then you take some more   Then you come running back to me      Play on, pretty music   Play on and on for me   Shine on, silver stars   Over the sea      Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes   The heartbreak is, if you could only see   That's not the way it's supposed to be      Endless lies shine in your eyes.Song of my love, only true love yeah!.Step back!.Don't let this   Moment go too soon..Honest it makes you sick..Come, come, come into my world   Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love      Take these arms that were made for lovin'   And this heart that will beat for two   Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you   And I've been such a long yime waiting   For someone I can call my own   I've been chasing the life I'm dreaming   Now I'm home      I need your love   Like night needs morning      Come, come, come into my world   Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love      Na na na na      Take these lips that were made for kissing   And this heart that will see you through   And these hands that were made to touch and   feel you      So free your love   Hear me I'm calling      Oh won't you   Come, come, come into my world   Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love      I need your love   Like night needs morning      Oh won't you   Come, come, come into my world   Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love.What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?.So, what you wanna do?.Tomorrow may never come, for all we know."
" School had just gotten out. It was the @DATE2 before my senior year. We had been planning this camping trip for the @DATE1 few weeks. We were so excited about it that that's all we could talk about. This would be the first camping trip we had been on without our parents. It would be the best four days of our lives. Sand, the beach, friends, quads, no parents; how could it possibly get any better than that?  We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people that were there, the more fun it would be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I did all the shopping the day before. We got lots of yummy stuff to make. After we got home from shopping we had to load all the bikes in the toy hauler. We each took two bikes, and we took @ORGANIZATION1's boyfriends bikes over so he could just drive over after work. We were up almost all night packing, trying to figure out the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a nice weekend at the coast, we could already tell. It was the middle of @DATE3, the sun was shining and it was beautiful outside. The next morning we got up and double checked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes, and those sorts of things. Then it was off to get gas and finally head to the coast! Once we got on the road the music was blaring and the windows were down, just like always. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there. When we finally did get there, there was a really cute guy setting up his tent in one of our camp sights. I asked @ORGANIZATION1 who he was and @CAPS2 told me it was @CAPS1 (her boyfriend) best friend, @PERSON1. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came over to help. The second I layed my eyes on him, I knew he had to be mine. In the next hour or so we got all unloaded and set up. By then many more people had shown up.We helped everyone else get all their things unpacked and set up so we could go on a ride. Our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect. It was warm enough to ride in t-shirts. We didn't stay out for long though. People started to get hungry so we went back to camp, made dinner and sat around the fire. There was probably twenty or so of us sitting around the fire, talking about everything from the stars in the sky, to the sand on the ground. Every time I would look up I noticed that @PERSON1 was looking at me. He would just smile, and look away like it was nothing at all. As usual, @ORGANIZATION1 started telling us about a funny incident that had happened to her in the @DATE1 ( @CAPS2 was such a klutz.)We all started laughing as @CAPS2 was showing us her bruises from falling down the stairs. @PERSON1 and i locked eyes.  Later that night @PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go on a walk. We walked all the way on the sand trail out to the dunes, and all the way to the top of a giant dune called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we got to the top we sat there, staring at the stars, talking. We realized we had lots of things in common. We liked to do all the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh.   Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, it means a lot. No one has ever been able to make me laugh the way that he does. I never knew that laughing could bring two people together the way that it did that one night at the dunes...Will easter come, enter my room?.Read between the lines, criticize the words they're selling   Think for yourself and feel the walls   Become sand beneath your feet      Fell the breeze?.This kicking here inside   Makes me leave you behind..Sie haelt immer still   Weil sie gefingert werden will   Blaeht sich auf I'm duerren gras   Das feuchte aeugelein wird nass      Gefangen in der finsternis   Sieht sie nie das licht der sonne   Vor geilheit zuckend fleht sie dann   Die zunge in dem manne an      Kuess mich      Sie beisst sich in jeder zunge fest   Weil sie sich gerne lecken laesst   Doch weil es etwas bitter schmeckt   Wird sie selten nur gekuesst      Gefangen in ...

" I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh, is a greatly valued thing. Sometimes just sitting around and telling old stories, or playing board games can leave you with a sore gut because you have been laughing so hard. Many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh. I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them. Family vacations are always chaotic, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another. Every winter our family gets together and goes to @ORGANIZATION1 to stay in our cabin there. A long weekend full of good food, trips to the mountain, snowball fights and family games, is a great environment to spark some laughter. Every year we bring big family games such as @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. My family members and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room in which the game is being played, tends to escalate almost through the roof. The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments over things like ""how in the world is that a picture of a sock!"" or ""That's not fair, you know the actual definition!"" I enjoy these times because they are memories that you can hold onto forever. Laughter is a part of happiness, and happiness needs to be a part of life. Spending time with those who make you laugh, are those that are worthy of your time. Wiser people than myself say that ""life is short."" I'm starting to realize that this statement is true. If life is short, then that time should be spent in the best way it can be; moments filled with laughter. .New times..You, you are so beautiful      It used to be, you and me   Love like no other   Our world around, could fall apart   But we had each other   Saw you walking, you were smiling   And it hit me like the first time   Feels like yesterday, has come and gone   But nothing's changed, when I look at you      You, you are so beautiful   You, you are so beautiful   You're my eyes   I just want you to know   That after all this time   You're still the one      Still hurts sometimes   Love on the line   But we said forever, yeah   Sailing on, through the storms   But we had together   And now I   I just want you to know   That after all this time   You're still the one      You, you are so beautiful   You, you are so beautiful   And now I   I just want you to know   That after all this time   You're still the one      You, you are so beautiful   You, you are so beautiful.Oh baby, your face is dark, and your eyes are wild..Cry out!.And every   Every moment is the history we make - and more   We got a legacy of understanding   I can love you better   But donY let your -   Heart stop beating in time   Don't take me below the danger level..Or said something insulting?.Northern dilemma, call of the cold   The arms of the arctic begin to unfold   Sit in a circle facing the sun   Get what you can now, winter is on      Truth on condition, never dig deep   Solemn reminders as groundwaters seep   Into foundations, centers of joy   To weaken and crumble, search and destroy      Light up the city, hiding so strange   You'd better take cover, it's love at close range   Oh solo mission, cover of dark   Army of one now, don't let down your guard      Sit in a circle facing the sun   Soak it in while you can, winter is on   I got no answer but you've got no call   I just can't compete with the weight of it all      Silent treatment, stone in the rain   Bright, shining doorway, try to remain   Northern dilemma, call of the cold   The arms of the arctic begin to unfold      Sit in a circle facing the sun   Soak it in while you can, winter is on   I got no answer but you've got no call   I just can't compete with the weight of it all.Hello young thing   I'm an old film star   Maybe you've seen my picture..Blow...

" My boyfriend and I planned to go to the @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 fair that they put in @LOCATION1, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and surprisingly my mom said ""yeah you can go"" i was really exited cause that would be our first @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 together. We were thinking of how it would be and we laughed because we were saying ""what if we were on a ride and we fell out,"" but knowing it wouldn't really happen. The day before @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 i got all my things ready for that day. i was really exited and nervous cause I've never been on rides like that so i probably didn't go to sleep till @NUM4 in the @TIME1.  @NUM1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was on a @DATE1, I didn't wanna go to school so my mom let me go to the fair instead of school. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face because of all the things that were going through my head. I got ready, my boyfriend @PERSON1 his brother and his sister came to pick me and my friend up around @TIME3. We drove to the @CAPS9 station, parked and got our bus fare. After we got on the @CAPS9, we took a seat and we were taking pictures and making jokes. Since we got in the @CAPS9 it their was nothing but laughter. I'm pretty sure the rest of the passengers thought we were crazy. It took about @NUM6 minutes to get to were the fair was at, when we got off the @CAPS9. We ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't @NUM7 so they weren't opened so we had to wait @NUM8 minutes till they opened the gates. Once we got in this lady was selling a card that had the tokens in it, so we bought it and got on a spider ride which at first didn't look as scary but it moved really fast so i was sliding everywhere. @PERSON1 and his brother were laughing at me and my friend @ORGANIZATION2 cause we were yelling but after a couple of seconds i stopped yelling and i ended up laughing for no reason i just laughed and laughed until i finally stopped and we got off. After that ride i wasn't really in the mood of yelling or looking dumb in front of the other people that were at the fair so we didn't get on any for a while until we saw the @ORGANIZATION3 wheel we got on it. It was fun but it moved a lot so it reminded me of what @PERSON1 and I were talking about ""that how funny would it be if we fell out."" so i held the pole that was in the middle and @PERSON1 and them started to laugh so i let go and started laughing to cause the were making weird faces at me. When the ride was over we got off and went to go get something to eat from a tent that they had at the fair that was selling food, drinks and a lot of other things. We all bought a big bean and cheese burrito, @ORGANIZATION1, churros and an elephant ear. It was so good we wanted to buy more but we didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear and I was the only one that actually ate all of it. So they started laughing because they we saying ""if you could eat two big elephant ears you could probably eat an entire elephant"" I laughed with then then said ""I bet I could, I'm just playing but these elephant ears are really good so I would eat twenty elephant ears"" they laughed and laughed so i just laughed with them as well. After I got done eating, we walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had. Their was a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater. But the bad thing was that we didn't have enough money for the sweater or for the rides so we just choose to go on all the rides and if we had left over money we would go back to buy a sweater. Then we pasted by a photo booth were they took a picture of you dressed up as if you were a pilgrim. I thought it was funny so i started laughing and my friends started to laugh as well because they didn't know what i was laughing about until i told them. Then they started laughing even more. We got on the last four rides and it was about @TIME2 we had to leave so we left waited for the @CAPS9. As we were waiting for the @CAPS9 two security guys come on their two horses and I thought its weird seeing horses in the city, we started to laugh. We got on the @CAPS9, took some pictures and went home..Unleash the weak, lay down by my side..I wanna argue, but there is nothing to say      Oh love, I think I'm ready   Ready for it   Ready for it

" The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air-restricting snowsuits. She opened the wooden front door and the chilly air stung my nose. @CAPS6 we hurried out into any @NUM1 graders paradise. @CAPS1 and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. @CAPS1 had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door we were stopped by @CAPS1's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and gulped down a tall glass of juice. @CAPS6 we flew out the back door with our sleds. There the giant hill waited for us. It slopped downward in a perfect @NUM2 degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow I heard @CAPS1 yell, ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her. I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.  Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see @CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away. As I got lost in my thoughts about @LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot.  By the time I reached my final destination, @CAPS1 couldn't breath. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill. She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier. Finally when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. ""@CAPS9 like a nice hike,"" I said. @CAPS6 we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it.  When I came shooting down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that snot bubble out of her nose like a rocket ship, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that both of us felt at ease with our hardships. Laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other. When I laughed, my mind shut out the whole world. On snow days we now laugh to remember that cold @DATE2 day, but on that @DATE1 day we were laughing to forget.  .Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I,   See you cryin' (cryin', cryin')..Nailed to the wall, giving your all   We know that you ain't dead..What if you knew it all along?.And, dogs begin to bark,   All over my neighborhood..Baby, baby, we like your lips   Baby, baby, we like your pants   All aboard for funtime      Baby, baby, we want in   We want some, we want some   All aboard for funtime      Last night I was down in the lab   Talking to Dracula and his crew   All aboard for funtime      Oh, I feel lucky tonight   I wanna get some and run around   All aboard for a funtime      Baby, baby, we like your lips   Baby, baby, we like your pants   All aboard for funtime      Everybody, we want in   We want some, we want some   All aboard for funtime.Not too little, just enough   Medium..It's gettin' late but I don't mind..Good night now ladies and gentlemen   Good night now ladies and gents..He's never Leavin'..Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet..My god I thought you were someone to rely on..First the high then the low   I'm getting ero-mantic vertigo   In the rain then the drought   Oh that's what loving you is all about      Fly, fly into this night   Oh and rectify my dreams   I, I love you more than life   Though seldom I'm serene   Feel the cold in the heat   I'm questioning my blind fidelity   Love is sweet love is tart   Loving you's a crime when we're apart      Fly, fly into this night   Oh and steal my fantasies   I, I love you more than life   Though seldom I'm at peace.Lovely ...

" My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never got to sink my teeth into one of those tasty, succulent @ORGANIZATION1, but we did have a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh to this very moment..If they knew how much I wanted her,   Their home room teacher would have   To send them home for a week..Cast adrift from the citizen ship,   lifeline denied, exiled this castaway..Each time that I give my heart to someone new,   They just turn it blue..Some guys fall in love with one girl, I gotta fall for two   There's just so much loving that one heart's supposed to do   So I go around with my heart dragging on the ground   Dogging me around, I'm the sorriest sight in town      [Chorus]   I got double trouble, I got double trouble   I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else oh yeah!.Lovely lady   Tell me what you feel   As a child were you mild   Does it make it so unreal?.He'll fly his astral plane,   Takes you trips around the bay,   Brings you back the same day,   Timothy Leary..Indulging a moment of your time..But you know it's love   That He offers you..Yay, yay, yay,   Yay, yay, yay..Take my hand, don't turn away   You've been sitting there all night long   I know that something must be wrong      Madamoiselle, voulez-vous danser?.I used to be content to frown   But anything for money now   I'd rather be a mannish kind of girl      I used to get drunk on spanish wine   Well now I'm drunk most all the time   I guess I've been too grateful for too long   So I sit around and wait   And watch the grass grow green   And count the cars   Feeling lost, alone, misunderstood   So I wait, hey hey   Yes I wait, hey hey      Well I had a girl in London town   She picked me up and she spun me round   I guess she was a mannish kind of girl      I went away and I still don't know why   Six feet under is where my bloody heart lies   I'm just afraid I can't forget her now   So I sit around and wait   And watch the grass grow green   And count the cars   Feeling lost, alone, misunderstood   So I wait, hey hey   So I wait, hey hey   Hey hey      I used to be too big to crawl   Now I don't give a damn at all   I'd rather be a mannish kind of girl      Yeah I used to get drunk on that Spanish wine   But now I'm drunk most all the time   I guess I'm just afraid I can't forget her now   And so I'll sit around and wait   And watch the grass grow green   And count the cars   Feeling lost, alone, misunderstood   So I wait, hey hey   Yeah I wait, hey hey   Yes I wait, hey hey   Yeah I wait, hey hey   Hey hey.My love goes out to those   whos souls rest tonight, and all we can do is just   ask ourselves why?.[Chorus:]   First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)   Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)   Third gear, hang

outta my mind ahhhh   But you've had me underrated   Rated, rated      (Ah ha) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being   What's wrong with being confident?"
"                   The @CAPS1 of The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 years old, and I lived on a farm out side of @LOCATION1 OR. I spent most my time playing with my brothers, @PERSON1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. We did everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of stuff to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing he had to do, was to build a pull @CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by poring cement on to the freshly bulldozed land. He made square holes in the cement to put the poles in, so it would hold the @CAPS3 up. Then he started to make the main building on top of the garage he made. I was so exited to see my dad building this @CAPS3 with his bare hands. Once he made the whole inside safe i was let in. I walked in and was amazed by how beautiful it was, and how perfectly built it was. But there was still stuff to do. My dad and my oldest brother @PERSON2 were putting the shingles on, so the rain and other crap could not get in. The next day I woke up to them hooting and hollering, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the pull @CAPS3. I sprung to my feet like a cat that just got shot by an air-soft gun, and ran down stairs to meet them. When they came in, it looked like they fell in a pond. They were soaked in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3. When we entered the @CAPS3, we felt a weird sensation, like if something just got cold and wet on our feet. Then we know what we had just done, we had just ran on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess. We walked backwards in our previous foot prints. When we finally reached the stairs, we had to find a way to cover our mess we had just made, or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, it was to paint over our foot prints with the left over paint. So right away we started to paint over our mess we had made, with the left over paint we found from the project. Soon we were all done, and it was a great relief that we would not get cot.  Later that day my dad and older brother went to the @CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise they sow a bunch of little foot prints on the stairs leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs they kept seen more and more foot prints. Ones they reached the top they looked at the wet floor and they only sow wet paint, no foot prints. As all this is happening my brothers and i were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them coming back so we went down to meet them. As they walked in i could see a puzzled look on there face, it was a look of confusion. They entered the door and looked right at me, it was like if i just stole a hundred dollars and just got cot. My dad politely said ""can i see your feet?"" ""@CAPS6"" i replied with a scared face. I showed him my feet and then he said ""did you perhaps go in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, then try to fix your mess by painting over it?"" I looked at him with a dumb face and said ""@CAPS6"". He just had a great big smile and said, ""go wash your feet"". Later that day the floor dried and we all went up there and ate dinner..Heart of mine go back where you have been   It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in   Don't let her hear   Don't let her hear you want her   Don't let her hear know she's so fine   Heart of mine..Elevator buttons and morning air,   Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,   If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,   But right now,   My time is theirs..It's great to see you, too   Let's grab a sock   It's time to rock   And afterwords   You never want to talk      We always agree   Who's in charge here is me   We never fight   You know I'm right   It's always straight between you and me      Let me go down on this girl for a day   We can play spin the bottle   Everyone can hear her say   That I was the best that she's ever had   She could be my Playmate   And she could call me Dad      Who, yeah   She's finally here   Who, yeah   She comes one time a year   Who, yeah   She's finally here   Who, yeah   My Playmate of the Year      [Chorus]      Who, yeah   She's finally here   Who, yeah   My Playmate of the Year      [Chorus]      She moves me   She makes me grow   I'm so happy and boy does it show   Now she's going to my head   Going to my head (to my head)   I'm going to make this milky clear   (You're my) Playmate of the Year   Playmate of the Year   Playmate of the Year.(I've got a sweet name)I've got a sweet name for you instead..Goin' down the road feelin' bad..Amelia      She's been caught up in the twilight   Always on the outside   Slowly drowning in the water   Drowning from the tears   Those green eyes   She's a pretty flower   Waiting in wind      Heavenly   She put a spell on me   Heavenly   Where's she gone?.In my life there's things I have done,   Times I have won in my life..Nice to know you were there   Thanks for acting like you care   And making me feel like I was the was the only one   Nice to know we had it all   Thanks for watching as I fall   And letting me know we were done..Somebody remembers the rose   While the other forgets how it grows   Would all the dangers   Would all the dangers of love   Am I still a stranger?.I was born again a little north of Disney Land   Somewhere under Wonderland and Hollywood   But then I had to go skipping and diving and bouncing back to New York City   Straight through the heart of America where all the wild things grow      I want to be an earthquake driver   I want to be an aquarium diver   I just don't want to go home      I mean, I live alone but I am hungry for affection   I just struggle with connection til the water calls me home   Down into ocean among millions of other lonely people   Drowning among the only people we are ever going to know      I want to be an earthquake driver   I want to be an aquarium diver   I just don't want to go home      I want to be like the people I see   They run all over just like me   I was saved but what keeps me awake   Is I'm tied into the lightning line   And I wanna be where the sun is shining   All night just a waste of time I, I don't want to see people like me   Just sleeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in      You look at me like I'm some kind of carnival attraction   You say love's this abstraction, just some ghost that you chase   Well, I am sorry friend, I am a blank space   But the words you remember from whenever you saw my face      I want to be an earthquake driver   I don't want to be an aquarium diver   I just don't want to go home      I want to be like the people I see   Hey man, they run all over just like me   I want to thank for what keeps me awake   This unplugged ears to the lightning lining   I want to see if the sun is shining   All night, chasing time I, I don't want to be with people like me   Just creeping in, waking in, hoping in, hating in      So what is the point of this famous self absorption?.I don't like this   I don't like this..The nails in his hands the thorns in his brow hanging on a cross for your sin my sins that is love he died for you and me while we still hated him that is love..So he told you you're the dream that he's been searching for   And he told you that he'd never met anyone like you before   And I can hear him telling you your lips taste just like sherry wine   But did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time      So he told you that he'd never lead your heart astray   And he told you that he'd love you forever and a day   And I can hear him telling you he's the shy and bashful kind   But did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time      Did he tell you that your heart will soon become   Another trinket on his bracelets of broken hearts   Did he tell you that the morning sun will find you   Patching up your shattered pride and searching for the missing parts      Did he tell you that the special love you're saving   Will disappear in shame and flames like mine   Did he tell you that he's known as Johnny one time   Did he tell you that your heart   Did he tell you that your heart.Earth was shakin', we stood and stared..And the chain i wear has 'em wishin' for the day when it came with a ball attached..Now didn't you know?.[Chorus]   Oh, when I think about the old days,   Lord, it sends chills up and down my spine,   Yeah life ain't what it seems, on the boulevard of broken dreams,   Guess I opened my eyes in the nick of time,   Cause it sure felt like the end of the line..I was yours to command..And that's alright..Yes, seasons come and mistakes I don't like to remember   But history shows that kindoms fall with time   Mistrust and deceit and the bottle it brought defeat   That's the last thing that's in the diary of my mind..I can't see it but I know when it's there   I can just feel it, it's everywhere   I can't see it but I know when it's there   I can just feel it, it's everywhere..Boy!.Give me your own special smile,   Promise you'll never leave me..There's a cowboy that I know ridin' in the rodeo   He's a feller that I'm fondest of   I love him and he loves me and that's the way it ought to be   But he drives me crazy when we're makin' love cause he always starts to yodel (yodel)   Well he always squeezed me at night while the moon was shinin' bright   And I knew I was under his spell   He was gazin' in my eyes and I was breathing pretty sighs   Then like Tarzan he'd let out a great big yell And he started into yodel (yodel)   Well when he led me down the isle I wore such a pretty smile   And my handsome cowboy wore a buckskin suit   When the parson said will you promise always to be true   My lover smiled and gently cleared his throat and he started to yodel (yodel).Well, I'm gonna raise a fuss   I'm gonna raise a holler   'Bout workin' all summer   Just to try to earn a dollar   Well, I went to the boss man   Tried to get a break   But the boss said 'No dice, son,   You gotta work late'      Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do   'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues      Well, my Mom and Poppa told me   Son, you gotta earn some money   If you want to use the care   To go riding next Sunday   Well, I wouldn't go to work   I told the boss I was sick   He said 'You can't use the car   'Cause you didn't work a lick'      Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do   'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues      Gonna take two weeks   Gonna have a fine vacation   Gonna take my problem   To the United Nations   Well' I went to my congressman   He said 'quote'   'I'd like to help you son,   But you're too young to vote'      Sometimes I wonder what am I gonna do   'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues.Oh, what a night..Don't tie me up and take my time   Waiting years and wondering why   I love old songs and what they know   Just turn 'em up and let 'em go      I ask myself what I need   Homesick blues and melodies   This old tune's what I desire   It's hot as hell it burns like fire, burns like fire      Chorus:   How 'bout you?.Bukan mainan kata kata kasih sayang   Yang kau ucapkan dari hatimu yang dalam   Pasti tersimpan di dalam hati berkesan   Menjadi palang kasih berikut yang datang      Reff:   Kan ku serahkan atau haruskah ku biarkan   Gadis yang cantik bernasib malang   Kekasihnya main belakang      Buka karangan atau kisah petualang   Yang menyebabkan aku ikut perhatian   Kan ku katakan karna satu kenyataan   Yang lebih indah seperti dalam impian      Kembali ke Reff      Kan kukatakan karna satu kenyataan   Yang lebih indah seperti dalam impian.""It's like trying to stop a fire   with the moisture of a kiss."".You drew my face in the sand,   And ever since that day you made me what I am..Faithless love like a river flows   Raindrops falling on a broken rose   Down in some valley where nobody goes   And the night blows in like the cold dark wind   Faithless love like a river flows      Faithless love where did I go wrong   Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song   Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong   Faithless love will find you   And the misery entwine you   Faithless love where did I go wrong      Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams   That's the way it sometimes goes   Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems   It's the feeling comes and goes      Faithless love like a river flows   Like raindrops falling on a broken rose   Down in some valley where nobody goes   Faithless love has found me   Thrown its chilly arms around me   Faithless love like a river flows.But you been sleepin' and you're creepin', babe,   But you been creepin' and you're sleepin', baby..""Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, Too-ra-loo-ra-li,   Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral, hush now, don't you cry!.No apology (no apology)   We will not back down (no apology)   We

" i woke up at @NUM1 from a cal from my cousin saying he wanted to hang out and introduce me to my cousin i have never met before. after we got off the phone i hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as i could. once they got to my house i frantically ran to the door and opened it really fast expecting some kind of reaction from my new cousin, but the one i got wasn't what i expected. right when i opened the door he began cracking up laughing at my for a couple of minutes. i got kinda mad at him because i didn't know what he was laughing at , until i looked down and realized i had no pants on, i rushed back into my room and put some shorts on and came back into the living room while they were still on the coach laughing at my stupid mistake. i sat down on the couch across from them and asked them what they were laughing about and that i did it on purpose for a joke, they didn't believe me at all, i don't blame them because that was the stupidest thing to say in that circumstance.    after they stopped laughing my cousin asked me if that was the only thing iv done like that,i replied no, and he started on about some stories about him doing dumb stuff like i did, that ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day, just reciting dumb stories about ourselves that were embarrassing. it turns out that just because i made that dumb mistake it made it easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in and just for that reason we have had a good relationship since we met .in the end i was glad i did that because it made us really close because we can now just laugh at each other when either of us do stupid stuff. and that's my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and i..Wow,

"                                   @DATE2 I woke up on a very beautiful day. The sky was clear and the sun was shining, which was unusual for a day in @DATE1. I got out of bed, as I usually do. I ate my breakfast, went to the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I left the house feeling a bit tired but great. As I walked to my bus stop, I watched people go by, saying @CAPS4 every now and then. When I got to my bus stop, @CAPS5 one was there. I thought that maybe the bus had already come and picked the kids up.  I waited and waited. Almost fifteen minutes went by. I was starting to get worried. If I had missed the bus, I couldn't go to @ORGANIZATION1. My parents worked until the @TIME1 and there was @CAPS5 one to drive me there. I then decided to walk to the next stop. @CAPS5 one was there either. By that time, I was sure that the bus had come earlier and left me behind. I started to walk back to my house. When I got there, I opened the door and went to check the @ORGANIZATION1 calender hanging on the wall. There was nothing written on @DATE3. @CAPS7 was a normal @ORGANIZATION1 day.  @CAPS2 could I have missed the bus? I never miss the bus! I started to ask myself of other possibilities. Maybe there were weather problems and the schools got closed. That wasn't possible because the weather was great. Maybe something happened to the bus, like an accident and @CAPS7 couldn't come, but that wasn't @CAPS7 either because then the kids would have been at their bus stops. The more I thought about @CAPS7, the less @CAPS7 made sense to me. What was going on that day? I got frustrated. I set my backpack down so that I could look for my daily planner. I opened @CAPS7 up and searched for the @ORGANIZATION1's phone number. Then, I took the phone and called the @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS1've reached @ORGANIZATION1,"" a woman on the phone said. "" @CAPS2 @MONTH1 I help @CAPS1?"" ""@CAPS3, I'm a student there and I was wondering if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus today?"" I said. There was a moment of silence. The woman didn't answer me. This was making me angry. ""@CAPS4, are @CAPS1 still there?"" I asked, with anger showing through my voice. Nothing. Then, the woman started laughing. @CAPS8 laughed for almost a minute. This had made me mad. What had I said that would make her laugh like that? ""Was @CAPS7 something that I said?"" I asked. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS5, I'm so sorry,"" @CAPS8 said, trying to keep herself from laughing. "" @CAPS5, @CAPS7's just that, do @CAPS1 know what day is today?"" ""@CAPS7's @DATE3, isn't @CAPS7?"" @CAPS8 laughed again. ""@CAPS5, today isn't @DATE3, @CAPS7's @DATE2."" I was shocked to hear that. I had spent all of my time trying to figure out what had happened. The only possibility that I hadn't thought of was that @CAPS7 was @DATE2. I felt like an idiot. I set down the phone and started to laugh. I laughed and laughed like I hadn't in years..Will he offer me his hunger?.Did you ever love me?.I've never seen your eyes so wide   I've never seen your appetite quite this occupied   Elsewhere is your feast of love   I know where long ago we agreed to keep it light   So lets be married one more night   It's light, light enough   To let it go   It's light enough to let it go      Remember when the scenery started fading   I held you til you learned to walk on air   So don't look down the ground is gone,   there's no one waiting anyway   The Smoky Life is practiced   Everywhere      So set your restless heart at ease   Take a lesson from these Autumn leaves   They waste no time waiting for the snow   Don't argue now you'll be late   There is nothing to investigate      It's light enough, light enough   To let it go   Light enough to let it go      Remember when the scenery started fading   I held you til you learned to walk on air   So don't look down the ground is gone,   there's no one waiting anyway   The Smoky Life is practiced everywhere      Come on back if the moment lends   You can look up all my very closest friends      Light, light enough   To let it go   It's light enough to let it go.England, my Lionheart   I don't want to go   Oh!.Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,   And the locusts sang and they were singing for me..Look in the mirror, and what do you see?.All they ever found were some bones,   And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,   Occasional pieces of skin..Wicked clown lovin' that dead body grubbin'..In the city in the falling right   The kids are hip and they can dance all night   In the city all the girls are pretty and they go...

"                                           ""Laughter"" Laughter is a very big part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too..I'm just a creature of habit   In a complicated world..Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.They shimmer like mirrors in Summer..True Story...[Chorus]

" Laughter is the key I think that being happy is a big part in life because, being happy feels so good. If I was in a relation ship that was not happy I would not like it at all. In a happy relationship comes laughter,the first thing I do wen I meet someone I always smiling and telling jokes because if I tell jokes and they are laughing they know that I am a happy person. If you meet any person weather it is a grown up to a friend to a person you want to go out with they will always enjoy laughter. Lets just say me and my girlfriend when I first saw her she was sitting in a desk in my history class crying and I asked if she is okay and she told me her story after she told me her story I told her how it feel and then I told her a joke and she laughed.After she got done laughing she ask me for my phone number and then that night we started dating. I asked her what she likes about me and she said the way I make her laugh.  I always love to make my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and my self. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy it would be a better place because I rather laugh and be happy then be mad or sad about something. when I was growing up I was by myself all the time so i had to learn how to keep myself happy so I would think about funny stuff I have seen or said in the past and try to make a story about it and it worked.When I got older i started doing stand up comedy. It made me feel so good seeing all the people laugh. then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night I will never forget that night.If i had to pick what I wold want to do for fun I wold be a comedian.Thank you for reading this and have a nice day.Check it...uggh!.There's one underneath my bed!.[Big Boi]   Well here's a formal introduction   Something to make you ponder   The situation's ugly, like ""In Living Color""'s Wanda (word up!).She sparkles, she dazzles, she lights up the room   We walk together to a table for two   Every man stares but her eyes are only for me   We take to the dance floor, she squeezes my hand   I can't believe just how lucky I am      [Chorus]   Meanwhile back in the back of my memory   You're still dancing with me   And I'm holding you once again   Meanwhile      We move to the end of a beautiful night   Tender the kisses, soft candle light   She draws the curtains, and slowly we climb up the stairs   And reach for each other the passion begins   We fall together as lovers and then,      Meanwhile back in the back of my memory   You're still lying with me   And I'm holding you once again      I try and I try, the Lord knows I do   But each time my heart beats back to you      Meanwhile I'll go on living my life now   I'll find a way somehow   Oh but, meanwhile back in the back of my memory   You'll always be with me   But I'll never hold you again   Meanwhile..Funk pop a roll beats up my soul.We'll say no man      But you can do the job      While you're in town            Later on we'll conspire      As we dream by the fire      To face unafraid      The plans that we made      Walking in a winter wonderland.The ""I do""s and the kisses from a miss to a misses   Can't wait for forever to stop      Let's set set the date!.Whitey:   Oh they day can't begin   Till the gard lets me in   Then I walk for some exersise      In less then a snap   I complete my daily lap   Then it's time to socilize      I see Raidy and Ruth   At the Information Booth   Have rigged the hearing lady   At Ben and Jerry's Shake      Then I go to Pet Land   Where the manager stands   Has about to be the dangorous stake      Then I pass the tie rack   On my way to Radioshack   Where I pretent to be a Hollywood Star   I try to walk like John Wayne   While singing in the rain   And the Janitor laughs all the time!.And like those   Memories the rain   Keeps pounding   Down, down, down..(spoken) Is she really going out with him?.If you don't want this puzzle to go unsolved..It's winter-fall   Read skies are gleaming, oh   Sea-gulls are flyin' over   Swans are floatin' by   Smoking chimney-tops   Am I dreaming   Am I dreaming...?.Mr. Rockefeller, how are you?.O beautiful for glory-tale   Of liberating strife   When once and twice,   For man's avail   Men lavished precious life!.You fools don't have a clue, do you?.Oh, oh, oh, cause I wanna be a celebrity!.We're building the perfect beast   (building, building, etc..)

" My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past trageties, future mishaps, and current mistakes--loss. Life is a puzzle i can not figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself the more I pounce into life. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way--to long. It sends the wrong message to those who can not tell if the mask is real, or perfectively put on. That is the message I want to give, right? Pretty soon, my laughter diminishes, my smile lowers, and my lips began to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding, and being squeezed at the same time. The eyes are becoming moist, they began to sting, and reden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me. Only pushing me to breakdown, which is something that is unexceptable. Peace, is the only thing needed at the moment; and of course, my best friend, tissue..I'm gonna get what's mine..Play that funky music   Play that funky music, white boy   Play that funky music   Play

"  It was @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 of @DATE1, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ORGANIZATION1 to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather. There was a parade in @LOCATION1, the parade that I was in. I loved being the center of attention, I loved to be seen; and whats a better way for that to happen then being in a parade? I was with my best friend @PERSON2 and her family. There float was for @ORGANIZATION1. Which is the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that they had owned at the time.   We had a lot of children on the float, probably about twenty. With only @PERSON2, @PERSON2's mom, and the manager of the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 to help watch the kids. The children were dressed up in animal costumes. The older kids were passing out candy while the toddlers were on the float.   @PERSON2 and I were laughing the whole time, I had almost forgotten that there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin baby's. I cant remember their names. We switched off a few times but for the most part I was holding the boy while she was holding the girl. They were well behaved baby's, they didn't cry often unless we had laughed to hard. Or yelled at the crowd too loudly.  We passed a bunch of people that we knew. I had seen my cousins, and a few aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving oddly fast. After a while @PERSON2 and I had started to get tired from holding the baby's and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed in so it wasn't very sturdy. We figured that it would be fine though.   The parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep right there in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the rail from exhaustion. We were still laughing and having a good time, but we became more and more relaxed and ended up with all of our weight pushing against the rail.   Next thing we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There was a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's. At the time I was holding the girl and @PERSON2 was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen to sleep. The baby's were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment that we had ever had.  The crowd started to laugh at us and our faces got beat red. Baileys mom came over to us to make sure we were all okay. She handed the baby's off to the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 manager who was there. Then @PERSON2's mom helped us up. Then we all burst into laughter. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our lives, but it was the funniest moment as well. Our butts were sore so we walked funny for the rest of the parade. One time @PERSON2 even stood up on the float and she went to lean against the rail again until she had realized that it wasn't there anymore.  At the end of the parade @PERSON2's family stood there waiting for us. Uncle marks kids, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, came up and laughed at us and made fun. Papa @PERSON4 had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @PERSON2 and I looked at each other and burst into laughter again. Papa just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad that we had just laughed the embarrassment off. Then we went home after that.  That @ORGANIZATION1 was a good @ORGANIZATION1 for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we wouldn't have laughed at our selves then we would have probably ended up crying of embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens its best to look at the bright side, make a joke out of it, or just laugh at yourself. @PERSON2 and I have made a fool of our selves many times ever sense, and laughing at our selves had made us much closer.   Every relationship whether its intimate, family, or just friendship needs laughter; or else the tough things in life will bring you down. Laughing is what keeps you bold, and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh about it that embarrassing moment can stick with you forever, and it will effect you in the long run. If you were to never laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That's why laughing is very important in everybody's lives..Do it (do it do it do it do it do it)   Do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it   Do it now do it now do it now do it now do it now

" Have you ever had a friend who when your with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget.  When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH1 never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS6 it up"" together.  In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away..You!.Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge..But yet and still you question me   I got is that's if you want it or ima set you free   ...

cold..Yo, first of all son peep the arson   Many brothers I be sparkin' and bustin' mad light inside the dark   Call me dough snatcher just the brother for the rapture   I hand glide, holdin' on strong, hard to capture   Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant   Then I react like a convict and start killin' shit      It's manifested the Gods work like appliances   Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences   The ninth chamber leave you trapped inside my hallway   You try to flee but you got clamped by the doorway      No question, I send your ass back, right to the essence   Your whole frame is smothered in dirt now how you restin'   While I'll be trapped by sounds locked behind loops   Throwin' niggaz off airplanes and the cash rules      Everything around too black as you can see   Swallow this murder one verse like God degree   Then analyze this soundtrack with satisfaction   You adapt like a flashback chain reaction.The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks   Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks   My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick   Like a come on a thumb   Poppin' hump, hump, hump   Pop out   The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be   'cause I'm shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea   Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop   But he never met the Tree so he never be-bopped out hop!.I drove through the desert last night   I carried the weight of our last fight   Elvis singing ""don't be cruel""   And I wonder if you feel it too   It's like we're going under      Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line   The question of my heart came to my mind      If I go on   With you by my side   Can it be   The way it was   When we met   Did you forget all about those golden nights?.From the city, to the floor..When things get so big, I don't trust them at all   You want some control,you've got to keep it small      D.I.Y..How can we live with anguish and fear   How can we shelter all that is dear   How can we take our fate in our hand?.apologies are exhausted   Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted   So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted   Switch to the opposite, now see it being re-enacted   Pull up the?.It's awful hard to find a job   On one side the government, the other the mob   Hey, hey ain't that right   The workin' man's in for a hell of a fight."
" During the @DATE1 of the sixth grade @CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON1's house.   ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 father"" @CAPS4 @CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5, @CAPS8's @CAPS9?"" I asked him.   ""@CAPS10 need to come home, @CAPS10 @CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers."" @CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS9 in @CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue @CAPS8 was happening, I was only @NUM1 and vaguely knew @CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS9 the phone and ran into @PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS4 @CAPS18 or @CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about @CAPS8 @CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS8 @CAPS4 father was doing, where @CAPS4 @CAPS18 was, and whether or not @CAPS4 sisters were @CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS9 the phone on @CAPS4 father. I had never hung @CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS4 @CAPS18 came to pick me @CAPS9 after @CAPS4 two week extended stay at @LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS4 @CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON1's @CAPS14 had called mine several times during @CAPS4 stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS8 was I supposed to do? @CAPS4 parents were splitting @CAPS9! @CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS4 street and drove towards @CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS4 room, leaving @CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS4 bed longing for @CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS9 in the @TIME1 on @CAPS4 own. There were so many things that @CAPS4 father did that @CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS4 @CAPS18 sent me and @CAPS4 sisters to @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house in @LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS8 was happening. @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS4 @CAPS5, not @CAPS4 @CAPS17 or @CAPS4 @CAPS18, just @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and maybe @PERSON1.  When I came home from @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS8 was going on and how @CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS12 was, so @CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS4 father called me at @LOCATION1's house..Oh my head!.Madly In Love With You      See you down there everyday   Trying to find a different way   To build some kind of latter to the sky      Trying to find some way to see   Secrets of eternity, and they don't come all at once   And you don't know why      Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name   While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart   See you when you cry yourself to sleep   It's tearing me apart      I know you wish you could see me   That's the way it has to be   Someday you'll understand,   Don't you lose your faith in me      I know you wish you could hear me   Sometimes it's so hard to do   But every morning sunrise it says   I'm madly in love with you   Yes I'm madly in love with you   Yes I'm madly in love with you   Yes I'm madly in love with you      I know that you're waiting for,   A chance to come in from the war   If only a moment, if only a day      A place where you feel safe and warm   A sanctuary from the storm   Until all of these questions fade away      But I cannot count on all the signs   You've passed away as mere coincidence   And I'm running out of ways to break through   Like a lonely lover, Waiting by the ocean   I'll never give up on you      I know you wish you could see me   That's the way it has to be   Someday you'll understand,   Don't you lose your faith in me      I know you wish you could hear me   Sometimes it's so hard to do   But every morning sunrise it says   I'm madly in love with you   Yes I'm madly in love with you   Yes I'm madly in love with you   Yes I'm madly in love with you.(I've got to know)   (I'm gonna be the kind of lover that you never had)   Hey you're just too funky..Eloquence belongs,   To the conqueror..Don't bring a suitcase..Now, we've got to hold on, got to hold on..[Chorus]      ""Oh man, I think the clock is slow""   ""I don't feel tardy""   ""Class dismissed"".When I hear all his lies, all of the devils wicked lies..Wanderin' in the rain,   Losing my mind      What a long, long time..In the   Center of the field stands an enormous black rhombus..It took a long time coming   That big over the shoulder statement   But when it came, it flowed easy as poison   Taken in extreme despair [Repeat: x3]      Remember to write often   In case you have something to tell me,   But please don't mention the unexpected guest   Staring into empty eyes [Repeat: x3]      A long lost confidence and pride   Come ringing back, come ringing back   To have the shadow back again   And happiness that feels like pain..All the things we should've done,   That we never did..Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh      Drive fast, I can almost taste it now..What'll I do, what'll I say?.(Look for me baby)   Well you can search high and low if you want   But you won't find me   (Look for me baby)   Well, you search the mountains   Look in the sea   Look all around the world   But you won't find a love   A love like mine   You'll be low   And cry misery[?].Dat man got a heart lak a rock cast in the sea..Here we go..We'll buy up all the cottages   And every house and every street,   Until we've got everything we need..We have no way to see eye to eye   Through all the walls in their mind   These are the pleasures that terrify   So leave them behind   You keep the chains that are in your life   We'll take flight of the dove   There's only one way to satisfy   This feeling that's love   And I'll say it again, and I'll say it again   And if the power comes between us   Oh, I'll know what to do,   I'm gonna say it to you   Cross the line tonight,   Take this chance and show your might,   All the world's on the other side,   Cross the line   Raise a flag to a moral crime,   We'll light a fire for this,   Make the papers by morning time   And lay in our bliss   So come on darling and share my mind,   There is no need to stay hid   'cause all we are now is two of a kind   Can you believe what we did?.It's enough to make you cry   Thinking 'bout the love gone by..Gonna tell aunt Marry bout uncle john,   He says he has the blues but he has a lotta fun..Joaquin,   Joaquin,   Joaquin,   Joaquin,   Joaquin,   (Joaquin)   Joaquin,   (Joaquin)   Joaquin,   (Joaquin)   Swank..Family now complete, and power's in your hands..I want to have it all through the night..I don't have anymore love songs to write for you...out where peace has never died   I'm wishin'..Delicate and nearly new   Cherish it and love it too   Oh, the rhythm of the real thing..My life changes all the time..I used to like you a lot,   (I was the class nerd)   Exactly who I'm s'posed to be,   (I'm totally Strasberg)   You play a doctor on TV,   (What you're doing is SO brave)      Deep down you're dirty but you try,   (I'm a good person)   The truth would break you so you lie,   (I want my work to matter)   It's in the choices that you make,   (I want to inspire)   No talent, just fate..The more we drank, the less that we had on..There's a nigga right now somewhere   He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks   And he's reading the back of the cereal   And in between the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit   And he wants my spot   I'ma find him though, I'ma sign him..I met the day   Feeling cheaper than usual   I guess you could say that I'm on sale   So take what you can while you can   Shop now intensive   I could snap at any moment   And I might feel more expensive   Oh      [Chorus]   I don't owe anything to you   I don't owe anything to you   You don't you know me half as well as you think you do   I don't owe anything   Anything to you      I met the mirror   The plastic hanging from my ear   And in that moment I went unfazed   So take what you can while you can   Less conscious only means more gold   I could snap at any moment and remember   I was not born to be sold      [Chorus: x2].(Beginning1 2x)   Mai-Ya-Hi   Mai-Ya-Hoo   Mai-Ya-Ha   Mai-Ya-Ha-Ha      (Beginning2 2x)   Mai-Ya-Hi (Ma Mi Ah)   Mai-Ya-Hoo (Ma Mi Ah)   Mai-Ya-Ha (Ma Mi Ah)   Mai-Ya-Ha-Ha      (Phrase 1)   Hello, Salute, It's me, Your Duke   And I made something that's real to show you how I feel   Hello, Hello, It's me, Picasso   I will paint, My words of love, with your name on every wall..Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,   Came to Bethlehem that night,   They found no place to bear her child,   Not a single room was in sight."
" Imagine this, flying past trees on a @CAPS1 @NUM1, four wheeler trying to keep up with everybody that's in front of you. That is how it was on new years eve.  We headed out from the house at about @NUM2 o'clock pm. When we left the house we headed for one of our friends house because we asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left we had to leave fast so we were not on the the road for a long time. When we got to our friends house we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They got all ready then at about @NUM2:45 we all headed out. All together now there was about @TIME1 of us about to head up on gillhooly on this ride.  When we finally got to the top of the mountain it was about @NUM4 o'clock pm. So we just hung out until @NUM5 o'clock. When I say hangout I mean we hit some mud holes and played around a little bit. By the time we were all muddy it was about @NUM4:55 pm. So we set up some fireworks to shoot off. Then about @TIME1 we shot all of them off. There was only about @TIME1 or @NUM7 of them. We started to head back home at about @NUM8 in the @TIME2 but one of our friends got stuck in some snow off the side of the road. We spent about a half hour digging him out before we finally headed back home. We arrived back at the house at @NUM9 in the @TIME2. We all got something to eat because we were all hungry then we watched a little @CAPS2 then headed to bed for the night.  .It's now or never, there's no time to lose..Does it feel the same?.And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown..I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth   Put the hood in mossy oak   I'm the   Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life   Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write   With a broken pen, there they go again   I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' jam   Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in   I'm goin' home, I'm home again   Bring it back up in the UK   With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack   Catfish Billy, hell, you say   I'm just bein' blunt, homie   Keep the grass      You changed me   Into what I am now   You made me   It was something I was always gonna be   It seems these broken dreams don't lie   And so now my broken wings will fly      Yeah, take one look   Better yet, take two   But if I take that break, there's a move you made   This dude you shape will come take you back   Back to the roots I've been   Without a fuckin' pot to pee in   Or a spot to sleep in   Hot or cold outside, it's not the season   'Cause I am not the reason   That the image you're used to seein'   Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless   Meaning yes, I'm different   Differently made   And me screamin' the A   Is not the difference in grades   It's the place I stayed   'Cause the schools were underpaid   The teachers taught, but to me they fought   A star that was underway   It was under Wayne, it was in my name   Michael   M.W.A   Atha   And in trouble I stayed   Breakin' out of this bubble they made   Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven   And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet   Fuck the world with a tattooed hand   Committed to the words I say   A blood line's not a family tree   It's a needle in my skin for all to see   I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk   But I drink and take the ink      You changed me   Into what I am now   You made me   It was something I was always gonna be   It seems these broken dreams don't lie   And so now my broken wings will fly.Though I have been a fool for love   I have finally made my score   I got a girl, and I don't mean to boast   But she loves me the most      Even though she's a highly paid whore   She'll give head to a sheep   She can stuff three cocks in her cheek   But she comes home to me      She'll do the groom and the best man   She'll slap your ass in the back of a van   But she comes home to me   She could fuck nine guys in a row      But still have a tenth for me   And I'm the only one who gets to kiss them lips   Unless you pay an extra fifty   So mister, don't you fall in love      'Cause I'm the only cat who doesn't wear a glove   Since her heart belongs to me   She has a throat that just won't quit   She can take all of it      And still have room for your balls   But she shops in the malls for me   She'll say twelve then call back and say one   But I don't care I know it's just work not fun      When she blows you, Jack   Don't you think she's not thinking of me   She'll go down on a yack, lick a horse's nutsack   But strictly for the cash      And it's only me who doesn't pay a fee   to watch her put a water bottle in her gash   (Put a water bottle in her gash)   She'll let you suck her nips till they're leakin'      But don't you dare try to go antique-ing   'Cause she does that with me   Her pussy's sweet as honey   But when she moans, it's just for the money      Unless she's sittin' on me   She'll cram your asshole with a mouse   But she won't do it in our house   Tough luck, Jack      She knows that don't fly with me   She might eat your wife's box   But she won't tell ya where you left your socks   She rolled up and down your fat prick      But it was me who took her to the Meg Ryan flick   She's got a face full of nuts   And a mouth full of cocks   She's done Seal, Larry King, four New Kids on the Block,      She blew the Winnepeg Jets right after a game   But they never got to know her actual name   On your face she will piss   On your chest she might poop      But she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup   That's simply reserved..

"                                                  Laughter  Laughter, how do you define it? The non-existence of happiness? Without laughter, @CAPS1 would be no smiles. Without smiles, @CAPS1 would be no affection. Without affection @CAPS1 would be no emotion. Without emotion, @CAPS1 would be no re-action. Without a re-action, everyone around you would be blank. Laughter; it can do so many things. It can bring people together or even tear people apart. It can be a way @CAPS2 express yourself, or even a way @CAPS2 put up ""your walls."" Laughter could mean so many different things. It can show so many different different things. It can show so many emotions, or even hide them. For example: @CAPS1's those people who laugh when they cry, when @CAPS1 mad, when @CAPS1 sad ect. But look beyond the picture why do you think @CAPS1 laughing at these times? When really that's not at all the emotion they are feeling. @CAPS1 not laughing because @CAPS1 all around a happy person. @CAPS1 laughing @CAPS2 hide the true pain they are feeling inside, because whether they like it or not no human can completely let ""it all on the line."" @CAPS2 be so vulnerable anyone could get in and cause pain.

" Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the @DATE1. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a @NUM1 minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor.  The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by @TIME1 fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the @TIME2 for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the @TIME1, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @TIME2 my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that @TIME1 was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead @TIME1. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that @TIME1. It was the @TIME1 together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip in to something much more meaningful..Spinning and spinning,   The dreams I know,   Rolling on through my head..You see this guy   This guy's in love with you   Really?.I loved you for a long, long

in blood   I even heard the angels declare it from above   There ain't no cure,   There ain't no cure,   There ain't no cure for love      There ain't no cure for love   There ain't no cure for love   All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky   The holy books are open wide   The doctors working day and night   But they'll never ever find that cure,   That cure for love.Ooooooo!.Many men

" Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When your angry, sad, nervous or even mourning. Laughing about the good times @CAPS1 had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad but is really quite hilarious. Many times throughout my life when things happened that made me in someway or another upset, the people close to me always helped by making me laugh. Realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as I had thought. Which made me look on the positive and light-hearted side of things. A specific situation happened when I was about nine years old. In school most kids at some time or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better it seems to be in their nature to make thoughtless observations, some times hurting others by drawing attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There was three other kids at my group and we were talking about who knows what, it was so many years ago. But then on boy starts talking about weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes were all eight or nine years old but he thought he was being cool. So he turns to me and says ""@CAPS1 are not in shape, your fat"". This crushed me how was I suppose to reply to this. I tried to act as if it didn't bother me. I went on to finish my art project. I could not help but hear repeating in my head those evil words that stung me. My eyes started to tear up and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I could not hold back the tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out if this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter then to say things like that boy did. As I got off the bus I was already feeling the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to bawl as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed ""@CAPS2 what's the matter, what happened?"" @CAPS3 tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked the boys name. I told her @PERSON1. She began to laugh and say ""That chubby kid with the buck teeth?, oh honey don't let that bother @CAPS1 he isn't in shape at all"". I started to laugh realizing he did have buck teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was being thoughtless and bragging about himself, which the statement were not even true and I was not fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly it all was. Laughter really did help me realize it wasn't so bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was over it. Laughing also got my mind off of what @PERSON1 said to me. Of course even though he said a thoughtless comment to me, I would not have said a thoughtless commend about any of this flaws. But laughing about how he had buck teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how I was making a big deal out of a little situation, also. .You fool no one, waiting to see if I'm gone..I still dream of lips I never should have never kissed..Are you happy now?.Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is)..Somewhere there's speaking   It's already coming in   Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind   You never could get it   Unless you were fed it   Now you're here and you don't know why      But under skinned knees and the skid marks   Past the places where you used to learn   You howl and listen   Listen and wait for the   Echoes of angels who won't return      [Chorus]   He's everything you want   He's everything you need   He's everything inside of you   That you wish you could be   He says all the right things   At exactly the right time   But he means nothing to you   And you don't know why      You're waiting for someone   To put you together   You're waiting for someone to push you away   There's always another wound to discover   There's always something more you wish he'd say      [Chorus]      But you'll just sit tight   And watch it unwind   It's only what you're asking for   And you'll be just fine   With all of your time   It's only what you're waiting for      Out of the island   Into the highway   Past the places where you might have turned   You never did notice   But you still hide away   The anger of angels who won't return      [Chorus]      I am everything you want   I am everything you need   I am everything inside of you   That you wish you could be   I say all the right things   At exactly the right time   But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why   And I don't know why   Why   I don't know.Blame me for where you are   Tell me what I gotta lose   That's a bit fancy   Well just another part of you   Well just another part of you   I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon   Oh-ah!.I forgot it though)      I wish I had a car   I wish I had a car (A cop pulled me over, buddy)      I wish I went with Charlie (5.2 blood level, state record)   I could have gone with Charlie (I'm in a wicked mess of trouble, ha ha!).When you've finally reached the end of the road?.Drifting too far from shore   You're drifting too far from shore (peaceful shore)   Come to Jesus today..Come on in, and pull yourself up a chair (like chairry!).Mary nodded   Pa rum pum pum pum   The ox and lamb kept time   Pa rum pum pum pum   I played my drum for Him   Pa rum pum pum   I played my best for Him   Pa rum pum pum pum   Rum pum pum pum   Rum pum pum pum   Then He smiled at me   Pa rum pum pum pum   Me and my drum..If your sweetheart, sends a letter, of goodbye   It's no secret, you'll feel better, if you cry   When wakened, from a bad dream, don't you sometimes think it's real   Well it's only, false emotion, that you feel      If your heartaches, seems to hang around, too long   And your blues, keep getting blue-er, with each song   Remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky   So let your hair down now, and baby go on and cry      (If your heartaches seem to hang around too long)   (And your blues keep getting blue-er with each song)   Well remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky   Why don't you let your hair down now, baby go on and cry      I said let your hair down, baby go on and cry..Ask a reason and no reply   Are we all too young to die?.This is not a challenge, just means that I love you as much as I always said I did   I was wrong   I have been laughable, wrong   Sand-paper, paper-mache, chalk, hung out wet..If you got love   You know you got it   If you got love   Can't live without it   If you got love   The world you're walking in   Is at your command..Ever stop to wonder   Should I question   Move a stone look under   Should I judge      How you have changed my friend   You're not the same my friend   Do you lose sleep at night   Do you ever stop to think   Where it went wrong for you   Who turned your reds to blue      [Chorus:]   Who put those tiny daggers in your heart   Who put those tiny daggers in your heart   Who put those tiny daggers in your heart      Ever stop to wonder   I should not question   Move a stone look under   I should not judge      They say you're never lonely   They say you're with the best   But when they turn those lights out   I bet you spin and turn   And cry just like the rest   And cry just like a baby      [Chorus]      Ever stop to wonder   I should not question   Move a stone look under   I should not judge      No need for desperation   No need for sweet revenge   Please try to remember   The door is always there   Don't you walk on by   The door is always there      All you want to do is kick it in   All you got to do is walk right in      [Chorus: x2]      Who put those tiny daggers in your heart   Oh yeah   In your heart   Yeah.Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine..If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know not me..Kiss goodbye to my hopes..What are you fucking crazy?.My heart's calculatin',   My true love will be waitin',   Be waitin' at the end of my ride..(Miley Cyrus)   Who are you?.Intimacy's   Fresh from my dreams   Over a triple X movie screen   I couldn't care less about being seen   A higher self esteem if you're on me?.Give me my love,   With you in my life..[Verse:]   She's just a girl and she's on fire   Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway   She's living in a world and it's on fire   Filled with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away      Ohhhh oh oh oh oh   She got both feet on the ground   And she's burning it down   Ohhhh oh oh oh oh   She got her head in the clouds   And she's not backing down      [Chorus:]   This girl is on fire....Slowly bleeding, watch the vortex feeding   Like a swirling vulture on your face   Every hour the unseen rays devour   Your screaming eyes cry out but they are blind      Father, forgive me my sins   Give me the nails, I'll hammer them in      The road to hell is full of good intentions   Say farewell, we may never meet again   The road to hell is full of good intentions   Get on the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets      Brave new world of secret fantasy   That hovers just beyond your bloody grasp   Close enough to thrill, the danger of the kill   Price for failure of your will      Father, forgive us our sins   'Cause we're all the junkies who never can win      The road to hell is full of good intentions   Say farewell, we may never meet again   The road to hell is full of good intentions   Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets      Father, forgive me my sins   Give me the nails, I'll hammer them in      The road to hell is full of good intentions   Parody of hope is the one that I must kill   We all have to live with our family inventions   Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets      The road to hell is full of good intentions   Say farewell, we may never meet again   The road to hell is full of good intentions   Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets.Forevermore you'll never change..THEY are here?.I liked the past too much   I've been going door to door like I got something to sell,   Wandering like a fool   Through the halls of a blue hotel..I will try to wait forever   It could take till the twelfth of never   How I pray we'd be together   Where did he go?.Have you heard the news   That is going round   He should know better      Have you heard the news   That boy's got dust for brains      After all this time   After all this time   Now things, oh, can never be the same      He should know better   Always straight, always cool   Endless style, nobody's fool   And always with the grace and superb manner      How he danced around the snakes   Left them spinning in his way   And stepped straight on the yellow skin banana      He should know better      In the early hours of day   The black night   He makes his way   Regretfully into the morning fog      Just one silly small mistake   Now all his bones their gonna break   To the curse and laughing smile   Of the little green frog      He should know better.Will you call them freaks?.You're as fine as wine,   I ain't handing you no line,   I'm gonna have to put you down for a while..Take your pain away   Take your pain away      For every aching heart   For every broken soul      So give up your worries   They'll only do you harm."
" A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 was a warm @DATE1 @CAPS1, some of my friends and I had planned to spend a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @CAPS3. We had decided on walking around and looking @CAPS2 all the cool stores. Eventually we would all get lunch and go out to the park near the river right next to the @CAPS3. We all agreed that @CAPS4 was a great plan and we would all have a wonderful @CAPS1. To start off, we all met @CAPS2 the bus stop by the movies. @PERSON3, @PERSON4, @PERSON2, @CAPS5 and I were all there. We decided to go look inside @CAPS6 @CAPS7 first because they have all the crazy things we love. Inside the store, I found a dress that was to die for. @CAPS4 was small and grey with skulls all over @CAPS4. Unfortunately, @CAPS4 costed @MONEY1 that i did not have, so we left @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Next, we went to @NUM1 @CAPS10 to see what they had in store for us. @PERSON3 and I created a black teddy @PERSON1 with a studded leather jacket. We gave @CAPS4 an awsome top hat and named @CAPS4 @CAPS11 @PERSON1. We all thought @CAPS4 was pretty funny because teddy bears are supposed to be cute and this one was kind of scary. We paid @MONEY2 for @CAPS4 and continued on our little adventure. We all decided @CAPS4 was about lunch time so we went and got chineese food from @ORGANIZATION1, left the @CAPS3, and headed down to the park next to the river. Before we got to the park, we stopped to go see what @CAPS4 was like under the bridge. There were towers of rocks all over the place, so we decided to build one of our own. We stacked @CAPS4 up almost as tall as me before @CAPS4 toppled over, almost crushing @PERSON4 on the way down. We followed the little path away from the rock towers down to the river. @CAPS4 lead us to a little beach next to the water. There was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water. We decided to eat lunch here instead of going to the park. After eating lunch, we were all full of energy again. @CAPS5 started a pine cone war by tagging me in the back of the head with one. After a few minutes, all of us were involved. We used the giant pillar from the bridge as a shield but @CAPS4 didn't quite work. @PERSON4, who had a better aim than all of us, was hitting everyone left and right, so the rest of us teamed up on him. We all threw pine cones one after the other untill @PERSON4 had to start backing away. As he reached the edge of the shore, he tripped over a big rock and fell backwards into the shallow water. Instantly, we all busted out in a roar of laughter that continued on for a good couple of minutes before @CAPS5 finally decided on helping @PERSON4 out of the water. He was very unhappy about the situation while we were all quite pleased. Jesica had managed to get a vidio of the whole thing and when we played @CAPS4 back to @PERSON4 he couldn't help but laugh with us. After that, we went to the park. Immediately, we all ran for the slide. ""I wanna go first!"" screamed @PERSON3 as we all made @CAPS4 up the jungle jim to the slide. All of us pushed and shoved to get to the slide before I finally suggested going down the big, swirly slide all together. Everyone els thought @CAPS4 was a great idea so we attempted @CAPS4. @PERSON3 was first, as she wanted, I was second, followed by @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and then @CAPS5. We started off realy slow and progressed in speed as more of us piled onto the slide. We ended in a pile @CAPS2 the bottom, all laughing histarically. When we all came back to reality we realized @CAPS4 was time to head home so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop. In the end, @CAPS4 had turned out to be an even better @CAPS1 than we had expected. The whole @CAPS1 was full of joy and laughter, whitch are a few of the key aspects of life. Without laughter, there would be no way to @ORGANIZATION1 when you are extremely happy or when you think something is funny. Happiness is one thing you need to live a fun, fulfilling life. I feel like the ability to laugh is one thing that makes a person fun to have around. Do you think you laugh often enough?.I can't believe that you're in love with me..Where can I be?.The swallowed seeds of arrogance,   Breeding in the thoughts of ten-   Thousand fools that fight irrelevance..Now come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home   If I had one wish, I wish I could   Go back to my old neighborhood   Where the good folks, they all love you as their own   Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house   Knock on the door and they'd all sing out   ""Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home""   I'd sing their praises long and loud   'Cause they're all my folks and I'm mighty proud   Of the little old town back home where I was born   I wish that I could hear them say   In the good old-fashioned, friendly way   ""Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home""   Well, they don't lock their doors at night   'Cause they all know they're a doin' right   And the good Lord's bound to have them for his own   If I'd go back to hear them pray   In the little pine church, they all would say   ""Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home""   Now come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home.They say animals don't worry   They think they know what's best   They're making a fool of us      They ought to be more careful   They're setting a bad example   They say animals don't worry   They're living on nuts and berries      They're setting a bad example   They ought to be more careful   You know animals are hairy?.Oh it?s in your hair too?.Yeah, they talk..Well, I'm a stranger when I'm leaving,   I was a stranger when I came..Welcome to a lovely   M-O-V-I-E!.I bought these devil chains..Ride the blue wind high and free   She'll lead you down through misery   Leave you low, come time to go   Alone and low as low can be      If I had a nickel I'd find a game   If I won a dollar I'd make it rain   If it rained an ocean I'd drink it dry   And lay me down dissatisfied      Legs to walk and thoughts to fly   Eyes to laugh and lips to cry   A restless tongue to classify   All born to grow and grown to die      So tell my baby I said so long   Tell my mother I did no wrong   Tell my brother to watch his own   And tell my friends to mourn me none      I'm chained upon the face of time   Feelin' full of foolish rhyme   There ain't no dark till something shines   I'm bound to leave this dark behind      Ride the blue wind high and free   She'll lead you down through misery   Leave you low, come time to go   Alone and low as low can be.Not speakin on my physical, my mental, or my aura   I'm

ever walked away      Maybe the old songs,   Will bring back the old times   And make her want to stay, oh oh      It's been too long without   Seeing her face light up   When I come home..Throw it up against the wall   Just to see how far it falls..No-one else I know can thrill me like you do   I only ever want to Go-Go dance with you   You're the dreamboy on my bedroom poster   Now we're on a rollercoaster ride      Chorus   You're the greatest gift that I could ever wish for   And there's not a single thing I wouldn't give for a little time with you   My Kookachoo   'Cause I'm so in love with you      No-one else can take me to the highs like you   You show me all the colours when I'm feeling blue   You're the brightest shining lights on Broadway   Pink in evening sunsets every day      Repeat Chorus      Even at night, when I'm sleeping   You are all I'm ever dreaming of..I am the distance you put between   All of the moments that we will be..Chorus:   'cause nightmares are somebody's daydreams   Daydreams are somebody's lies..Damned if I'll yield at the end of the chase..I'm alive....[Man]:   Mr. Gibson?.The purple-headed mountain,   The river running by,   The sunset and the morning,   That brightens up the sky..Say I'm crying   I'm looking at what's on TV   Pain and suffering   And the struggle to be free   It can't ever be denied   And I never will ignore   But when I see you coming   I can take it all      You're so fine   Lose my mind   And the world seems to disappear   All the problems   All the fears   And the world seems to disappear      Say you're mine   And give yourself to the feelings that you know   I'm needing all that you can give me   All the things that you do so well   Words are healing   Sweet anticipation   Making spells as the shadows close in   Fall across all our yesterdays      Say if I could   Look into myself and reason   But I could never never see   Or make sense of the dealings   Turn around   Am I looking at salvation   Make me realize all that I am   You put the light inside this man"
" Many people love to laugh and others just don't like it as much. I'm one of those people who love laughing and will laugh when my @CAPS1 tell a very good joke. I believe that it's important to laugh because it just feels good, it makes you feel that everything is going okay. With the people that you can laugh the most with are obviously your @CAPS1. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @CAPS1 are, and what they try to do is to make you laugh.       My best friend @PERSON3 and I have the tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together it's all about laughter. We have fun in class, we do pay attention but we just make it interesting and we just laugh so much that it can distract others. Our teacher from sophomore year @PERSON1 always told us that we're very giggly and that it was a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen anyone laugh so much in her class. For example that year we were studying vocabulary and when @PERSON3 and I saw the word countenance we started laughing so much because it means the face and it reminded us about the tv show @CAPS1. Every time that word came up during that week we would laugh so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. Her face would turn as red as a tomato and I just couldn't even say a word. Even now that we're juniors we still remember that and we just start laughing so hard that it gets to the point that if I'm standing up I will let myself drop to the floor and move my feet as if i was kicking something. Now that's when my @CAPS1 start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious.      @PERSON3 and I are the kind of people that if something is very boring to us there has to be a way to make it fun. Some teachers appreciate that we actually have fun in their class but others just don't like it at all. Like last year in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 our teacher @PERSON2 completely freaked out because @PERSON3 and I were laughing. We were paying attention but we only laughed when we were doing our work but he didn't like it. To us that class was extremely boring and we just made it fun but @PERSON2 decided to make a sitting chart. Well you would think that by having a sitting chart @PERSON3 and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all but that didn't happen. That didn't stop her or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and we made class fun. When he thought that we weren't paying attention he would ask us questions and we answered them correctly. Even though @PERSON3 and I were sitting far away from each other we would move our hands around until we got each others attention and then we just started laughing because we looked funny doing all of that without saying a word.  Every day when my @CAPS1 and I eat lunch at school at our usual spot we're always laughing. People that don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say that I'm just myself and that I'm very optimistic. @PERSON3 and I say ""@CAPS4 sad panda's today"" we say that when we see that one of our @CAPS1 is quiet or looks sad. The most weirdest thing is that when @PERSON3 and I laugh at the same time it sounds like one laugh. The first time we realized that we had the same laugh we just started laughing even more that we couldn't even breathe. It's important to laugh because it feels so good and you feel relieved even if you're having a really bad day, like health teachers say it takes more muscles to frown then to smile..I know every engineer on every train   All of their children, and all of their names   And every handout in every town   And every lock that ain't locked   When no one's around..I'll make an early start, I'm

" Laughter is used as a ""cure"" for everything. Through out life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know other people better. I personally use laughter to create a bond that another person and I can relate at a level to be able to share our thoughts and our feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important through life. Laughter can help someone find people that have similar and common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that one person or that group of people that can enjoy similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups laughter is a common thing between all of these groups. Without this similar interest, Laughter would not exist through life. Laughter helps through every day life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships might be shown through co-workers, through authoritative figures, and friends and family throughout every day life. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" The relationships between people are built from laughter and enjoyment of being with other people. These relationships are formed at a social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their life. These relationships are created to help introduce the the stories about life. In my life I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have occurred through my life are when family member have died. My great grandparents on both of my sides of my family have died. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that is that one of my friends died at an early age. What happened is that he was riding an all terrain vehicle. But the good things through my life have been breath taking. The one thing that has been breath taking from my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point in conversation. When I first started my relationship with @PERSON1 all I could think about was being able to enjoy the times that I have with her. On the first day that we started spending time with each other we could not stop laughing. Everything that either I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing that we had in common was laughter. At every basketball game we would try and spend as much time as we can together. We try to get to know each other a little bit better by finding common interests through laughing because, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Laughter can help someone find people that have common interests as one's self, laughter can create good relationships between compatible people, and to help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used in a personal level to become closer to that person. Laughter can be used through every day life. Laughter is an element to a relationship that should always exist..We're automatic tonight!.Tomorrow you won't be here, and I don't expect you to..All the ones I have loved calling out my name   The sun warms my face   All the days of my life, I see them passing me by      As I am soaring I'm one with the wind   I am longing to see you again, it's been so long   We will be together again      Is it a dream?.You got to realize this is the wind-up,   You're gonna feel much better once you made your mind up..I can feel your hate in my soul, I wonder what it is you know      Black Devil... what's going on?.Don't let me cross over   Love's cheating line   I'm tempted, my darling   To steal you away   Don't let me cross over   Stay out of my way   You know that I love you   And I'm not the stealing kind   But I'm faced with heartaches   And love's cheating line   Don't let me cross over   Love's cheating line   You belong to another   And can never be mine   I know one step closer   Would be heaven divine   Don't let me cross over   Love's cheating line   I've tried to forget you   But what else can I do   When your eyes keep saying   That you love me too   I know if I lose you   Not a dream will be left   I don't want to cheat dear   But I can't help myself   Don't let me cross over   Love's cheating line   You belong to another   And can never be mine   I know one step closer   Would be heaven divine   Don't let me cross over   Love's cheating line.Could you forget that what I said?,   And how I died inside my head..Girl, there are no words to say   What I feel in my heart   You, you're on my mind night and day   And it hurts me when we're apart   When you're not here by my side   There is nothing in this world for me   I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see   And although you may think it's crazy   Here is where I want to be   I will always need your love   Now, I can see every dream   When I look in your eyes   And though things never are what they seem   There is one thing that I realize   That there's no doubt in my mind   We can make this love go on forever   I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see   And although you may think I'm crazy   Here is where I'll always be   And I need you with me 'cause you are the dream   That finally came true for me   And all my life there'll be no one else   If I looked all my life there could be no one else   And for the rest of my life all I need is you.I did my best to please you   But my best was never good enough   Somehow you're only able to see   All I am not   Did you ever look behind?.Save it for me   Save it for me   I know that you must cry:   Cry, baby, so do I.

"                                        Laughter  @CAPS1 I first meet someone there is always a small wall to climb before we can really get to know eachother: @CAPS2 laugh. I have this weird awkward nervous laugh, almost like a giggle, that I don't even hear. Others do though. Especially when they first meet me. I think that most times it helps people get to know me faster. But other times, I think it is a hindrance to getting to know me.  When someone first meets me they usually always comment on @CAPS2 laugh. They either seem slightly thrown off by it, or they easily open up and joke around with me. They always tell me about it: @CAPS3 odd it is, @CAPS3 much I do it, what it's like, etc. As if I've never been told about it before. But, this is fine. I don't hear it come out and I don't mind being told. I don't really think of it as a bad thing. When they seem thrown off by @CAPS2 laughing, I get more awkward and try to control it, but usually end up doing it even more. If it seems to make them laugh and they don't make fun of me for it, I just let it come out, and it becomes very easy to get to know that person. I never really realized just @CAPS3 bad it was, until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with @CAPS2 youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We went around town and took videos of different things, actions, situations, and people. One of these things we had to get a video of was one of us playing rock paper scissors with a stranger. So I promptly went up to two older women and asked to play a game with them. When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just @CAPS3 weird @CAPS2 voice, laugh, and mannerisms are with strangers. People had told me about them from time to time, but I'd never seen it. It was weird! Another situation was working at @LOCATION1 this @DATE1. When we did icebreaker games to break tension and meet the people on our teams more easily. Everyone on @CAPS2 team seemed slightly weirded out by me. I couldn't figure out why, until one person would just step up and be straightforward: and inform me of @CAPS2 laugh. As the first week went by though, I was the person that knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be bridged quickly, or made greater: depending on @CAPS3 people react to it. If they join in it together, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person doesn't join into the laughter, or doesn't enjoy the other person's laugh, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes hard to breach this distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that is just too bad. We should all be able to laugh together and share in eachother's joy..You are a beutiful, but no mind..Upside the head, upside the head..I feel it deep inside,   I feel it come alive,   Here comes that feeling again..Yeah!.Well I went to a dance and I wore out my shoes   Woke up this mornin' wishin' I could lose   Them jumpin' honky tonk blues,   Yeah the honky tonk blues   Well lord I got 'em,   I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues..Always there!.But sweet Helena just says, ""God bless Johnny."".My heart is gonna break from the fall..But does he love you (does he love you)   Like he loves me (like he loves me)   Does he think of you (does he think of you)   When he's holding me   And does he whisper (does he whisper) of his fantasies   Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been lovin me.But I don't need to be reminded a change is gonna come..I'm in the world   I'm in the world   I'm in the world   I must be part of it   At last convinced   To the right of it   I'm in the world   For some reason or another   Sometimes I get up   And sometimes I don't bother   But I'm here   I'm here for, oh Lord, who knows?.I can stop you from fallin' apart   Tried to say in my own way...   Somebody give me the chance to say...   Let my love open your door....How many times I say the words   Again and again and again and again   A thousand different ways I say I love you      And I tell myself I can and I can   If I say the words again and again   A thousand different ways I say I need you      When I'm with you walls will crumble   I sit down I stand I stumble   Every word I mumble comes out wrong      And again I try, trip and fall,   Burn inside and again I call your name...      And I want to dance this dance with you   This crazy dance for two   And dancing I' ll pretend   Everything's alright   And you, stay with me tonight   Baby....Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, ""I hate everything."".Hey, hey, hey   Now, I'm gonna build a boat, I'm gonna make it float   'Cause I'm getting the chase for a faraway place   Gonna set the sail, gonna catch some wind   And the big red sky's gonna be my only friend   With a boat for two, just me and you   You can be my teacher, I can teach you too   Gonna try a few things that I've never done   Maybe talk to the fishes, maybe have some fun   Maybe shake my pale fist at the angry stars   While I dance a jig under the eyes of Mars   When we get to an island where no one's ever been   We can get down and dirty in our animal skins   And I stand with my thing hanging out in the wind   Where the water's sweet like honey   Hey, hey, yeah, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, hey, now   I've been feeling a chill, from the East wind blue   Is it creeping up slow, have you felt it too?.The breasts that you gave me don't shake when I dance..Ma mama weer all crazee now   Ma ma mama weer all crazee now   Woo!...Hello there sir..Sometimes I listen to what people try to say   And then when I tune in I think no that's not the way   Sometimes I listen to what people have to say   And then when I tune in I think no that's not the way      It must be the music   It sounds so confusing   It must be the music   That's opening my eyes   It must be the music   It sounds so confusing   It must be the music   Making me satisfied      Sometimes I listen to what people try to say   And then when I tune in I think no that's not the way   Sometimes I listen to what people have to say   And then when I tune in I think no that's not the way      It must be the music   It sounds so confusing   It must be the music   That's opening my eyes   It must be the music   It sounds so confusing   It must be the music   Making me satisfied.And what's the difference?.Had my chances   Could've been where he is standing   That's what hurts the most,   Girl, I came so close   But now you'll never know   Baby, I loved you first (I loved you first, loved you first)      Girl, it should be me   Calling on your phone   Saying you're the one, and that I'll never let you go   I never understood, what love was really like,   But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes   But now when I see you with him   My whole world falls apart      Because,   I've been waiting   All this time to finally say it   But now I see your heart's been taken   And nothing could be worse   Baby, I loved you first..'s on a nigga dick      Got me up at three o'clock cookin eggs and grits      I'm a cheifa C.P I can't take this shit

times are all gone   Then I'm bound for movin' on   I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way."
" Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activites, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adament about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM1 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now everytime I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten..Look...what you're doing   Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love,   Will you throw away such sweet, sweet love..So for all the things you do,   Santa Claus we're thanking you!.I come to You, my God   The joy of my salvation   In You I put my trust   And though I walk through valleys low   I will fear no evil   Your love endures forever, reaches to the heavens   And though my flesh may fail me   You're the strength of my heart, You will always be   I know Your loving kindness, the power of forgiveness   All that I hold dear is Yours, my Jesus, it's You I long for   I love Your Name, oh Lord   I'll sing Your praises eternally   My life is in Your hands   And when darkness tries to cover me   I will ever give You praise   I will ever glorify   Your love endures forever, reaches to the heavens   And though my flesh may fail me   You're the strength of my heart, You will always be   I know Your loving kindness, the power of forgiveness   All that I hold dear is Yours, my Jesus, it's You I long for   More than anything   And though I walk through valleys low   I will fear no evil   Your love endures forever, reaches to the heavens   And though my flesh may fail me   You're the strength of my heart, You will always be   I know Your loving kindness, the power of forgiveness   All that I hold dear is Yours, my Jesus, it's You I long for   Oh it's You   [Incomprehensible].'Cause here they come      (The dog days are over   The dog days are gone)   Here they come.(together)   Together?.People tell me I'm not the same now   I only respond to my name now   But no one knows it better than me myself   Without your love I can never be myself   Oh, when you gonna come home Cindy   Cindy, my Cindy.Where do we go from here   There must be something near   Changing you, changing me forever   Places changes, faces change   Life is so very strange   Changing time, changing rhyme together   There's no where else to go   This could be our last show   Changing dreams, changing schemes never   We are never satisfied   Love is gone, along with fun   Now we're reaching for the gun   Changing cast, changing fast, no more tether   We are never satisfied.And now is I'm yellin' over her,   She's yellin' over me..A boy is born in hard time Mississippi   Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty   His parents give him love and affection   To keep him strong moving in the right direction   Living just enough, just enough for the city...

"            ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 you ever felt it? The feeling of uncontrollable joy building up inside you? The one feeling you @CAPS11 never explain in any word but one. Laughter. This is a wondrous feeling, it @CAPS11 make you do so many things, like scream, and yell! Someone once said, Laughter, is the beauty of life. It helps us get out of hard times, and @CAPS11 always put a smile on our face when we @CAPS2 down.It will make good times even better and never be forgotten. Laughter is something everyone needs. It helps us connect with people. It will causes you to be come one with another. This is the story of me. The story of how laughter caused me to meet the love of @CAPS7 life. How the connection of joy between us will last forever, and how the memories of his smile will last in me forever.  @DATE1 was the day i met him. It was a gorgeous day, snow was covering the ground for miles, and I was surrounded by @CAPS7 amazing friends. The feeling of boredom quickly flew over our heads. So we decided it was time to @CAPS1 some fun. We quickly put our snow cloths on and began running for the door. The moment we stepped out side everyone but me stopped. I kept going into the ice cold air. I slowly began to realized they had stopped and I tried to come to an immediate halt. They all began to laugh as i laid on the icy growned holding @CAPS7 soar butt. I was so embarrassed, and so shocked by @CAPS4 had just happened that i didn't move, I just laid back and closed @CAPS7 eyes. As I was laying there I began hearing foot steps. I figured they were just @CAPS7 friends coming to help me. But when i opened @CAPS7 eyes, it wasn't @CAPS7 friends I saw. It was a hansom man, one I had seen few times before in @CAPS7 high school. @CAPS3 leans down and ask me, ""@CAPS2 you okay?"" I reply in a shy tone,""yes..."" @CAPS3 smiles and reaches down to help me up. As our skin gently touches I get butterfly's all through out @CAPS7 body. I look at him and @CAPS11 tell @CAPS3 was getting the same feeling. As i stand to @CAPS7 feet we both smile and begin to laugh. I still to this day don't understand why we laughed... I am wondering a million things at once, but the first question that exits @CAPS7 mouth is, ""@CAPS4 is your name?""@CAPS3 reply's with a smile and says, "" @CAPS6 and you?""""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I reply.I begin to thank him and ask if @CAPS3 would like some hot chocolate or coffee. @CAPS3 reply's in a cute tone that sent chills up @CAPS7 spine. @CAPS3 says ""I would rather take you to get a burger, will you come?""A huge smile washes over @CAPS7 face as i say ""yes."" @CAPS3 grabs @CAPS7 hand and walks me closer to @CAPS7 friends. They all began to smile and turn and walk away quickly into the depths of @CAPS7 house. @CAPS3 smiles and decides not to follow. We both begin to laugh as we run over to his car. I @CAPS1 heard a lot about @CAPS6, @CAPS7 friends @CAPS2 always talking about how cute and muscular @CAPS3 is. The first thought that went streaming through @CAPS7 head was, I cant believe @CAPS3 wants to take me out to lunch!  We sit awkwardly in the car all the way to a small dinner called @ORGANIZATION1. When we stop @CAPS3 jumps out of the car and rushes to @CAPS7 door to open it. @CAPS3 is such a gentle men i thought to myself. When we get to our table @CAPS3 orders for us both and asks me all sorts of questions. @CAPS3 kept me smiling the hole time! I don't think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and @CAPS3 drove me home we smiled and laughed as @CAPS3 told me joke after joke. When we reach @CAPS7 house @CAPS3 asks me a question. A question i will never forget. ""@CAPS11 i kiss you?"" @CAPS3 asks. I do not answer but lean in and kiss him. We look into each others eyes after wards and begin to laugh.. Why we laughed i still will never know. But at that moment i fell in love. At that moment i realized laughter will be the connection between us forever. The laughter is in remembrance of him. @MONTH1 @CAPS3 rest in peace...  .The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy   If he rides by an' asks fer food and water   Don't treat 'I'm like a louse

it's time for a change      There is something that I feel   To be something that is real   I feel the heat within my mind   And craft new changes with my eyes   Giving freely wandering promises   A place with decisions I'll fashion   I won't waste another breath      You can feel the waves coming on   (It's time to take the time)   Let them destroy you or carry you on   (It's time to take the time)   You're fighting the weight of the world   But no one can save you this time   Close your eyes   You can find all you need in your mind      The unbroken spirit obscured and disquiet   Finds clearness this trial demands   And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief   For the fortune lies still in his hands   If there's a pensive fear, a wasted year   A man must learn to cope   If his obsession's real   Suppression that he feels must turn to hope      Life is no more assuring than love   (It's time to take the time)   There are no answers from voices above   (It's time to take the time)   You're fighting the weight of the world   And no one can save you this time   Close your eyes   You can find all you need in your mind      I close my eyes   And feel the water rise around me   Drown the beat of time   Let my senses fall away   I can see much clearer now I'm blind      (Ora che ho perso la vista)   (Ci vedo di piu)      You can feel the waves coming on   (It's time to take the time)   Let them destroy you or carry you on   (It's time to take the time)   You're fighting the weight of the world   But no one can save you this time   Close your eyes   You can find all you need in your mind      Find all you need in your mind   If you take the time   Find all you need in your mind   If you take the time.Why don't you come down   And break out and let me burn?.We

"Like all great things in life, laughter is the thing that keeps me going. Without laughter I'm depleted. I'll tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. First is @CAPS1 mom. (@LOCATION1) @CAPS1 mom is the one that showed me, laughing is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to fall down. Laugh at the fact you're silly, you messed up but make sure to get back up. @CAPS1 mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @CAPS1 teenage ""drama"" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I just don't want to be me anymore to laugh through it. When me and @CAPS1 best friend got into a fight @TIME1 @DATE1 I didn't come out of @CAPS1 house for about a week and a half, I didn't want to talk to any of @CAPS1 friends. @CAPS1 mom tried to get me to call her but I never did, till one day @CAPS1 mom sat down on @CAPS1 bed and said ""@CAPS2 it's not want happens to you it's what you do with it, do you hear me laughing all the time, when I'm upset, sad and happy...that's what I want you to do no matter what is going on in your ""drama"" teenage life don't shrug it off @CAPS2 laugh it off, call her.""@CAPS1 @CAPS5 friends definitely take second place. Like @CAPS1 friends, I also have @CAPS5. When I'm with them nothing else phases me, the whole world could be ending and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel since I have @CAPS5 I speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @CAPS1 friends with @CAPS5. @CAPS1 friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing that they taught me is having @CAPS5 is a gift and a curse. When @PERSON1 and I are hanging out it doesn't matter who we're around we make there day, we can't help feeling goofy plus the non-stop laughing. Sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not.Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I'm a total comedian. When I try to be funny I'm not that funny but when I don't try I make people laugh so hard they cry. @CAPS1 whole life I've been told ""@CAPS2, wow you really are something no matter what mood someone's in you just make life seem so amazing."" @CAPS11 people laugh is one thing but @CAPS11 myself laugh is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS1 room @TIME1 I was thinking about @CAPS1 past life and became pretty upset but to pull myself out of the negative thinking I started thinking about the good times I've and within five minutes I was laughing so hard @CAPS1 stomach hurt.     Like I said ""like all great things"" laughter is @CAPS1 greatest. Laughing really can open someones eyes. I will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes.  .Well, what have you got?.Let It Snow!.And frankly Mike's right about him being right..Napoleon: Wait a minute now..Free like we want to be   Some time you want to get off   Leave the work and take off   But the boss man say you gonna lose you pay   No chain on your feet now   9 to 5 got you beat now   You

pain, whisper my name, exciter   Surrender to me and I'll guarantee, you'll pray that the night never ends   Come play the game, this is my name, exciter      And I'll show you a world where you've never been, it's time that you knew   There's no time for waiting, it's time to begin, I'm the one's gonna take you.I'm gonna be blue in the morning   I'm gonna be blue in the morning   Soon as I saw

can't take a warning   See a girl and fall in love   With just a pretty face so easy easy.I'm bringing life to all the parts,   I am consistent, I'm the heart..Take me let's see how much I'm tamed..We will fly way on high   Where the cool winds blow   Or in the sun laughing having fun   With all the people we know   If the situation should keep us separated   I know the world won't fall apart   You will free the beautiful bird   Caught inside your heart      Can you see her oh she flies so proud   Cast her wild wings over water and cloud      That's the way it's gonna be little darling   We'll

his child bride   Amanda, for a drive   She was only seventeen   He just lived to see her smile   Their commitment to each other   Burned like a forest fire   Otis on the radio singing Stand By Me      As a trooper pulled them over   And said Jimmy where you been   Someone matching your description   Has just robbed the liquor store   Amanda said He's been with me   But they weren't listening anymore   Down at Precinct Number Five   They questioned Jimmy through the night   The sheriff said He's gotta stand trial   Armed robbery is the charge   Amanda said This cannot be   Gonna stay right here until you set him free   And I love him      Here to eternity   Forever   Unto eternity   Oh God gave me something   I must hold on to   Gonna hold on him   No matter what you do   The old courthouse was crowded   As the judge reviewed the case   In a year of re-election   He was desperate to impress   Innocent or guilty      He saw an opportunity   To send Jimmy down for life   To the Penitentiary   Disbelief and anger   As they dragged him away   In a cell below the courthouse   They beat him like a slave   But his use of martial arts   Struck a blow for liberty   Felled a guard with a fist of iron   And killed him instantly   All the press surrounded Amanda   Coming down the courthouse steps   Pleading for her young man's life   And in a moment seen by millions   She bowed her head and cried   Show my man some mercy   He's the father of my child   I love him      Here to eternity   Forever   Unto eternity   Oh God gave me something   I must hold on to   Gonna hold on him   No matter what you do   I love him   Here to eternity   Jimmy Doyle appeared again   In a second public trail   For the murder of a prison guard   They sentenced him to die   But Amanda with her long red hair   Made one last plea   As the court fell into silence   She cried out desperately   This man of mine is innocent   As one day I shall prove   It's an open case of self defense   All this circumstantial evidence   You place before your court   Has robbed me of my husband   Forget I will not   I love him      Here to eternity   Forever   Unto eternity   Oh goodbye my Jimmy   'Til we meet again   In a better world than this   I swear I'll clear your name   'Cause I love you   Here to eternity.You gave it to me but I really don't want it   I came out on top by the luck of the draw

safety of the crowd   Then they wondered why I lost my sense of humor   Hey take them crosses from my doorstep there's no reason to my rhyme   Everybody knows somebody will take care of me in time   I

"In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all is very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of iteracton with someone. Laughing says,""what you are saying is funny"" or, I'm enjoying this"". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. Its so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that, we love the feeling we get when we are with them,and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe its a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe its at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, its always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life. Im not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, i feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps,what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right..Sure was a tragic tale   Because five short minutes of lovin'   Done brought me twenty long years in jail      Because five short minutes of lovin'   Done brought me twenty long years in jail.Since you've gotta go,   Oh, you better go now, go now, go now, go now,   Before you see me crying..Is this the way to Amarillo?.Fire, fire!.Oh - oh oh..Hey!.Queen Victoria,   I am cold and rainy,   I am dirty as a glass roof in a train station,   I feel like an empty cast iron exhibition,   I want ornaments on everything,   Because my love, she gone with other boys..I've just been fakin' it,   I'm not really makin' it..Cody: (shouting) Alright, now..I remember   I remember the first time   When you touch me   And my heart was going round and round   I remember the first time   When you kiss me   And my heart was going round   My heart was going round and round      Doch ich werd nie mehr wieder daran denken   Diese Erinnerung werd ich dir schenken   Denn du sagst, du verstehst mich   Und ich wei?, du verstehst nicht   Denn du f?.Where dem girls at, girls at?.Blackbird singing in the dead of night   Take these sunken eyes and learn to see   All your life   You were only waiting for this moment to be free..it's too late!.They have: sunflow'are cakes, moonbeam cakes,   Gizzard cakes, lizard cakes,   Pickled eels, pickle snakes,   Fit for any king,      If you want a bust of jade   Or an egg that's more or less decayed   Or in case you care to meet a maid   For a nice but naughty fling,      Come to the supermarket,   If you come on an ostrich, you can park it,   So come to the supermarket   And see pe-   King..Snoop Dogg!.Pick me up!.Jaden: Yeah I'm just looking at the piano   Will: You ready to come out yet?.Mr. Rockefeller, having fun?.Don't you know what I'm trying to say?.Girls' school      Well now, Roxanne's he woman trainer   She puts the kids to bed   She gives them pills in a paper cup   And she knocks them on the head      Ah...

" It was my first year of @CAPS1. high school and I was feeling pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going awesome! I had woken up on time, eaten a good breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang I hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. One of my close friends had called my name so I turned to wave and when I turned back I ran directly into @LOCATION1. We hit hard. I flew backwards dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened.   After lunch I had @CAPS2. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, @PERSON1, was in it. On my way there I made a quick pit-stop to the ladies room to make sure I still looked decent and then headed to class. As I walked in the room the first thing I saw was @PERSON1's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye. Then I registered the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eye lashes at my dream guy! You got it, @LOCATION1. From that moment on it was war! As the year progressed @LOCATION1 and I constantly strove to out do each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind @PERSON1. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new hair cut and she would get high lights. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show @PERSON1 this new game I'd learned. But of course when I walked in the room @LOCATION1 was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had over @LOCATION1, books. Both @PERSON1 and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made @LOCATION1 jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of the sudden @LOCATION1 appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. @LOCATION1 and I stood there glaring at each other, rage searing from our eyes until some one broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including @LOCATION1 and I. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up.  Eventually we became really good friends. To this day we still laugh about or @NUM1 grade rivalry..We use to laugh in the pouring rain   Out in your corner everyday   A thousand smiles can't hide the pain   Can you give me, give me more love   You never seem to satisfy   Can't help but wonder why   Why you lie to me everyday   I just want you, want you to fly   [Pre-Chorus:]   How can I lift you up   When you're the one who's bringing me down   How can I sacrifice in your life   I'm no one      [Chorus:] [2x]   I'm on the run hiding from you   You wont find me I know what to do   Under the sun thinking of you   I hate to love you   I love to hate you      I used to call you on the phone   Every time I feel alone   You never leave me on my own   That makes me   Makes me feel all right      Now you say you don't understand   Everything that I have done   All I want is peace of mind   Can you give me, give me more time      [Pre-Chorus:]   How can I lift you up   When you're the one who's bringing me down   How can I sacrifice in your life   I'm no one      [Chorus:]   I'm on the run hiding from you   You wont find me I know what to do   Under the sun thinking of you   I hate to love you   I love to hate you.He's the wrong kind of paradise..Keep falling..Lord!.Listen up      You said that you would treat me right   But now all we do is fight   You said that you would love me long   But oh boy you were wrong      You should have known that I don't play   So get outta my fucking way and      Don't hold it against me baby   You're the one who forced me to leave   So don't hold it against me      Cause you had it   But you lost it   And you'll never get it   Again      You said that you would buy me rings   But my love don't cost a thing   You said that I'm the only girl   But there's another in your world      You should have known that I don't play   So get outta my fucking way and      Don't hold it against me baby   You're the one who forced me to leave   So don't hold it against me      Cause you had it   But you lost it   And you'll never get it   Again      Boom boom boom   You're blowing up my   Boom boom   You're blowing up my love      Boom boom boom   You're blowing up my   Boom boom   You're blowing up my   L-O-V-E      Yeah you should have known that I don't play   So get outta my fucking way and      Don't hold it against me baby   You're the one who forced me to leave   So don't hold it against me      Cause you had it   But you lost it   And you'll never get it   Again.One more twist of the knife and it's time to cut and run..She's fragile like a string of pearls..Hey!.She walked into the room just like a dream   I was spellbound into silence   Do you know the way it feels   The rock'n'roll changed to a symphony   Appearing just like magic   But I knew that she was real   Then something deep inside of me   Said go ahead and try   Ain't no use in holdin back   Don't kiss the chance goodbye   Hello to romance   Is it goodbye to those one night stands   Where you get what you want   Such a crazy steal   Hello to romance   Hello to romance   I walked across the room to say hello   She raised her head and smiled at me   I knew which way to go   Once she spoke sweet music filled my ears   For hours and hours and hours we talked   Time seemed to disappear   verse 2   chorus   When you see the chance to win romance   Act before it slips away   Don't wait until tomorrow   To hear yourself say   I should've done it yesterday   Should've done it yesterday   verse 2   chorus   chorus.Where all the prizes for the games she entered   With little chance of much success?.Amanda, light of my life..No one cares   Nobody's wrong,   No one see   I'm not so strong..Rings on your fingers, love on demand   Knight in black leather   Oh, you've got command   And how I love ya, baby      Whoa, my knight!.I couldn't think of a thing at all..All my girls      All the girls can be shakin' in the bounce tonight   Gonna do it like we do when the bounce is right   If it's

and smiling..How did that romance come through?.Shut up when I'm talking to you!.Sometimes I'd like to go to bed   With a hundred women or men   And lose my mind in lust and drink   And to hit some people into feeling good, oh      Sometimes I'd like to dance in the street   Don't wanna go to work, just wanna lay in bed all day      Why don't you then   Why don't you then      Life just seems oh so meaningless   And who can blame us for wanting these things   But you just try being free my friend   And everyone will hate your guts, I only want to free.He kin be happy   With just a sip of gin..Am I in my room with my toys?.I've read more than a hundred books   Seeing love mentioned many thousand times   But despite all the places I've looked   It's still no clearer   I'm still no nearer   The meaning of love      Noted down all my observations   Spent an evening watching television   Still I couldn't say with precision   Know it's a feeling and it comes from above   But what's the meaning   The meaning of love   (tell me)      From the notes that I've made so far   Love seems something like wanting a scar   Well I could be wrong   I'm just not sure you see   I've never been in love before      Next I asked several friends of mine   If they could spare a few minutes of their time   Their looks suggested that I've lost my mind   Tell me the answer   My Lord high above

" Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day. All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS3"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes. I knew this was different tho. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time..Repeat chorus.While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs   And sometimes all the nights can be so long   And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone   While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light   And quietly she says how was your night?.Total power to hit it..Somebody's callin' your name..I'm Alabamy bound   I'm gone.Hallelujah      I am a preacher with a message for my people   Over the world, scratching on the ground   Looking for the peace that nobody has found      I am a spokesman for a better way of living   Love is the word and it can be heard   If you are young the message can be sung      Let me hear you sing,   Hallelujah      Oh, tell it to the man who's power is the sermon on the wall   Tell it to the man who says you can misjudge them all   Tell it 'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowd   Tell it on the field of war and hope you'll soon be justified      There is a better way of life and it's not so hard to find   If you live and let the people in your world speak it's mind      I am the pupil who sells his life for freedom   All over the world and it can be heard   If you are young the message can be sung      Hallelujah.Does it really matter who was wrong or right?.Nightingales   We keep our sails   Filled with love..And they told us that in our days   We would know what was high on high      We would follow and not defy in our time..Whatever happened to you?.Take heed, don't ignore it until your money time will hold..That's the way it's gonna be,   And that's the way that I feel..)I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now   I wanna rock right now.Would you like to hear the story of   A girl that many soldiers know   It's a tale of love and all its glory   They tell when the lights are soft and low   Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate   Standing all alone every night you see her wait   She waits for the boy who marched away   And though he's gone she hears him say   ""Oh promise you'll be true fare thee well Lili Marlene till I'll return to you   Fare thee well Lili Marlene""   With the kiss she gave her promise   To be constant as the stars up above   Every soldier knows she kept her promise   And she has been faithful to her love   (Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate   Standing all alone every night you see her wait   For this is the place a vow was made and breezes sing her serenade)   Oh promise you'll be true fare Thee well Lily Marlene till I'll return to you   Fare Thee well Lily Marlene      Although each tale must have an ending   No one knows just what the end will be   But tonight when twilight is descending   If you'll come along here's what you'll see   Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate   Standing all alone every night you see her wait   And as they go marching to the prey   The soldiers all salute and say   ""We'll tell him you've been true..It gets lonely,   On the other side from you..Do they wobble to and fro?.Don't need a crystal ball for me to see clearly   No astrology or Tarot cards   Watching CNN and holding my breath   To face the daily news scares me to death      I'm pessi-mystic   I'm so fatalistic   I'm pessi-mystic   I don't believe a thing   I'm pessi-mystic   I'm so nihlistic   I'm pessi-mystic   For what tomorrow brings      I can't hear a word you say   So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up   I like being sick this way   So shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up      Everybody's mind is badly infected   Everybody feeds the parasite   Everything is dark so why not accept it?.You stop the crowd   I cried out to break the spell   You wake and smile   I just snapped and lost control      Distracted by irrelevance   The stress and the tension   The stress and the tension   I'm in a lull      There's nothing more dull   Then talking about yourself   But what I meant to say   I'm sorry that I lost control      Distracted by irrelevance   The stress and the tension   Crawling through the keyhole   I'm in a lull.""Never, never say goodbye   To my part of your life..Its a lane side fight   Oh no!.Expect no mercy!.Don't you?.In the morning you go gunning for the man who stole your water   And you fire till he is done in but they catch you at the border   And the mourners are all singing as they drag you by your feet   But the hangman isn't hanging so they put you on the street      You go back Jack do it again wheels turning round and round   You go back Jack do it again   When you know she's no high climber then you find your only friend   In a room with your two timer but you're sure you're near the end      Then you love a little wild one and she brings you only sorrow   All the time you know she's smiling you'll be on your knees tomorrow   You go back Jack do it again...

love babe   Its cause I'm too tired to be that strong   Now I'm burned out on your affection   Because it comes from a jaded tongue   And I'm burned out on your direction baby   I know I'm not the only one   Baby it's time   Baby it's time   To draw the line   Draw the line      Draw that line baby   Draw that line yeah   Keep it straight   Keep it close   And tell me   What do you have in mind

you can turn away and tell me to go   Now you can write me a letter   You can send me a postcard   But don't tell me what you're thinking   If you really don't know baby   Baby it's time to draw the line   Draw the line   Yeah draw that line.If everyone was listening you know   There'd be a chance that we could save the show,   Who'll be the last clown   To bring the house down?.You don't eat your feedback..The grass it seems greener since I saw it last   New beauty keeps springing from out of my past   These old things seem so good to me   And you most of all   And you most of all      The day that I left here this place seemed so wrong   Saw many just like it all summer long   I thought of you, not someone new   It's here I belong   I was sure you'd be gone      It doesn't matter where I went   I don't regret the time I spent   The things I learnt just brought me back to you      Here I stand in your doorway and what will you do   The best I can hope for is that you'll want me too   I took the chance of losing you   And it's you that I found, and me.If I should lose you   The stars would fall from the skies   If I should lose you   The leaves would wither and die      The birds in May time   Would sing a lonely refrain   And I would wander around   Hating the sound of rain      With you beside me   No wind in winter would blow   With you beside me   A rose would bloom in the snow      I gave you my love   But I was living a dream   And living would seem in vain   If I lost you.You feel like a candle in a hurricane   Just like a picture with a broken frame   Alone and helpless, like you've lost your fight   But you'll be all right, you'll be all right      [Chorus]   Cause when push comes to shove   You taste what you're made of   You might bend till you break   'Cause it's all you can take   On your knees, you look up   Decide you've had enough   You get mad, you get strong   Wipe your hands, shake it off   Then you stand, then you stand      Life's like a novel with the end ripped out   The edge of a canyon with only one way down   Take what you're given before it's gone   And start holdin' on, keep holdin' on      'Cause when push comes to shove   You taste what you're made of   You might bend till you break   'Cause it's all you can take   On your knees, you look up   Decide you've had enough   You get mad, you get strong   Wipe your hands, shake it off   Then you stand, yeah, then you stand      Every time you get up   And get back in the race   One more small piece of you   Starts to fall into place      [Chorus]      Yeah, then you stand, yeah   Yeah, baby   Woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo   Then you stand, yeah, yeah.Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today."
"I have lived in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 almost my whole life, I went to pre @CAPS5 all the way up to @NUM1 grade. @CAPS7 was about half way into my @DATE1 when my mom had told me the ""@CAPS3"" news. Honey we are moving, i froze in shock i didn't know what to think, no we can't move. why she said, um maybe because im going into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I don't want to go somewhere where i have no clue who anybody is. Don't worry my mom said you will make some friends. Where are we moving any wise i asked? Lebanon she answered me in a soft @CAPS1 voice. @CAPS6 i guess its not that far away from here. There you go she said @CAPS7 wont be that bad once we get there and get everything settled in and unpacked. Yeah @CAPS13 i still don't know anybody there, @CAPS6 your cousin @PERSON2 goes there and he is a junior so he could maybe drive you to @CAPS5 everyday if you wanted and introduce you to some people. Okay i said i was excited @CAPS13 i didn't want to move away from @CAPS8. We started to pack up our things, @CAPS7 took us about a week to get everything out of the old house into the new one. After the house was all packed and our things where out we started to clean. We cleaned from the up stares all the way down, head to toe that took us about two days tops to do. So in all total @CAPS7 took us about a week and two days to get everything packed, moved out, and cleaned. We said our @CAPS11 byes to our friends and family and where on our way. Its not like we will never see them again i said to my brothers. We finally pulled up to the house, @CAPS8 was so anxious to see what @CAPS7 looked like. My mom opened the doors go check @CAPS7 out she said, wow this place is amazing we love @CAPS7 the boys said. I told you that you guys would love @CAPS7. We went up stares and picked out our rooms. there was only four bedrooms so the two younger boys had to share. When we where all done with that we stared to unpack our stuff. I was so tired from doing everything that after i was done unpacking my room i went and took a nape on my bed. When i woke up i realized that i have not unpacked everything like i though i did, so i finished with that. @CAPS5 started in about a week i was so excited @CAPS13 nervous @TIME1 the same time to see what @CAPS7 would be like. Finally the day was here, honey wake up time for @CAPS5 mom said already @CAPS13... oh forget @CAPS7 i said im groin to @CAPS5 no matter what. I get out of bed brush my teeth, hair, do my make up and get dressed. ""@CAPS9"" ""@CAPS9"" @PERSON2 is here time to go. I rush down stares get my back pack and get in the car. @CAPS11 morning he said @CAPS11 morning, you excited for @CAPS5 he asked yeah kinda just a little nervous.Don t be i will introduce you to my girlfriend she is a fresh man also k sounds @CAPS11 i said. We pull into the @CAPS5 wow that's a a lot of kids i said yea there is @NUM2 freshman this year. We get out of the car and go inside. Lets go show you around to your classes alright i said. This is you first period @PERSON1 she teaches @CAPS12 arts. He shows me the rest of the six and sends me to class. I walk in @CAPS8 staring @TIME1 me, my sstomach turning into notes wanting to fall out of my stomach. Welcome @LOCATION1 just sit down i will be with you shortly the teacher says. She shows me where to sit ans introduces me to the class. Finally the class is over, @CAPS13 i still have to go to six more. This day feels like its going bye for ever, i walk to the rest of my classes wondering if they will not be that scary @CAPS13 no i was wrong. Most of the teachers made me introduce my self in the front of the class @CAPS7 was terrifying! I get on the bus can't wait to get @CAPS2. I walk threw the doors, how was your day, did you make friends, mom calm down i said to her sorry i just want to know. My day was @CAPS11, can i go take a shower now? Yeah just don't take long k. I get out and go lay on my bed awww time to go to sleep i though @CAPS13 no my brothers had to come bum rush me and tell me about there day. @CAPS7 was about @TIME1 okay i though time to go to bed. ""@CAPS14"" ""@CAPS15"" time to get up @LOCATION1, oh no not again!..And Onward!.How does it feel to be...

I have lost   Who lie in lands where memories   And dreams are lost      The breeze that blew around her hair that day   The timeless dress that flowed in endless sway   I almost touched her shoulder, she almost turned to face me   A thousand distant summers, away.Lo, bare, straight legs in the water!.I've got something to say   And I just can't fucking hold it anymore   It means more to me today   Then it ever fucking did before   I'm a punk   And I've finally learned what it means to me   It doesn't dictate who I am   I define what the word means      'Cause I ain't ever scared to say   I'm proud to be where I am today   Always follow your dreams   If I ever cared what people say   I wouldn't be who I am today   Be yourself to be free      Use destruction   It's the only way to pave salvation   But don't forget creation   It's the real history of this nation   Hate and fear your government   Because what they steal is your only covenant   Love your land, your nation   But don't forget there's a whole world out there waiting      'Cause I ain't ever scared to say   I'm proud to be where I am today   Always follow your dreams   If I ever cared what people say   I wouldn't be who I am today   Be yourself to be free      Free!.Don't you hear Jerusalem moan?.They tell us that we're savages   Who haven't got a hope   We're burning in the furnaces,   We're choking at the smoke   They say we haven't got a choice,   Refuse to recognize our voice   Yet they enjoy commissions   From the proceeds of the joke      Those Butterfly Boys   At play with their toys   Stinging like bees   Itching like fleas   Butterfly Boys   You got the toys   You got the breeze   We caught the freeze   Butterfly Boys give us a break   We got the groceries you got the cake      They tell us that we're savages   Who cannot understand   We're sailing on a sinking ship,   We're swimming in the sand   They put their fingers in their ears,   Refuse to recognize our fears   And fly off to Jamaica   When we call them underhand.Hello, is it me you're looking for?.They say things happen for a reason,   But I can't find one good reason   Why she's gone so soon..Never had trouble sleepin'   Always had someone next to me   Nights I won't remember   I fooled around til the fool was me      Never thought much about you   On and off like a well worn shoe   Now I worry where you're walkin'   I guess the shoe's on another foot      Ohoh a little more pain and I'll know it   A little more hurt, I'll know it's love   Over and over til it's over   Drives me crazy, it must be love      Lately I'm hearin' rumors   You've been makin' serious plans   Should I have held you when I had you   Right here in the palm of my hand      Chorus      This much heartache, it must be love      Ohoh a

town's on fire..Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty..I wish you could see the world through my eyes..I feel responsibility to hate what I can't eat..Yeah, we must try to shake it down do our best to break the ground   Try to turn the world around one more time      [Chorus].Henry   Brother, got to sing your song   Brother, is taking us so long      For the elderly brother has raised us by his love   And to be equal is the freedom of his love   When will we realized that the skin is just a glove   To be thankful for the freedom of his love      Sister, stand up tall and proud   Sister, yell it strong and loud   I'm black and I'm proud      For no human can change the course of time   And no human creates the live in mind   So how can a man makes rules when yet he has no love   And how can a man a woman fill they are above      For an heavenly brother has raised us by his love   And to be equal is the freedom of his love   When will we realized that his skin is just a glove   And be thankful for the freedom of his love      Brother brother brother   Brother brother brother brother   Brother brother brother brother..Half moon, night time sky,   Seven stars, Heaven's

" Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed too do. It frustrated me so much, I started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @DATE1. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at @CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @NUM1 years ago. My brother decided that he want too take me on @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about @NUM2 or @NUM3 time. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk too him for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. And too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the @DATE2 because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in @NUM4 grade when my best friend @CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about @NUM5 hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got too talk too him. Only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is @CAPS5, she was about @NUM6 months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about @NUM6 times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane.

"Have @CAPS3 ever had that one moment with some that @CAPS3'll remember forever and laugh about every time @CAPS3 think about @CAPS2.? @CAPS8 I have and I think that everyone should have a moment of laughter in there life. On the day of @DATE1 was the day that I will laugh about for the rest of my life. On this day my boyfriend @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 decided that @CAPS1 wanted to take me out to an early breakfast. @CAPS1 called me around four in the morning saying that @CAPS1 was starving and that @CAPS1 needed some food in his stomach. So @CAPS1 picked me up around five am and we went to @ORGANIZATION1. We sat there drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @PERSON1 wanted to go for a drive, let me remind @CAPS3 @CAPS1's from @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 has @CAPS6 clue where anything is in @LOCATION2. So as we head out of town I am giving him directions to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his @DATE2 poniac which is not the greatest vehicle to be going for a ride in around this town, because around here @CAPS3 need a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @CAPS3're probably going to get stuck where ever @CAPS3 go. We were doing great at first because we stayed on the pavement roads, but @PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to go down a gravel road and we both decided that maybe @CAPS2 was time to go home. When we came up to another road @CAPS1 decided @CAPS1 was going to turn around. That was not the greatest idea. @CAPS1 seen the sign for the street but @CAPS1 turned the wrong way into a field. @CAPS2 was okay, @CAPS8 as first @CAPS2 was . Until @CAPS1 went to back up, and the car wouldn't move. I looked at him and laughed and said ""I told @CAPS3 that @CAPS3 needed to go right not left."" @CAPS1 then looked at me and said, ""@CAPS2's not stuck I just need to try a little more, and we'll be out."" One thing that @PERSON1 did not know is that @CAPS2 had been warm in @LOCATION2 the last couple of days, so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @CAPS1 might not want to @CAPS5 that but @CAPS1 said that is was fine @CAPS1's done this before. So I got out of the car and went and stood by the road. @PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that was not the greatest thing to @CAPS5, because now the tires were berried under the mud. I started to laugh so hard because @CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @PERSON1 had one more thing that @CAPS1 wanted to try, because @CAPS6 offense but @CAPS1's a boy and they can @CAPS5 everything themselves. So @CAPS1 told me to get into the car and put @CAPS2 in reverse so I did as @CAPS1 said, then @CAPS1 said okay lightly push on the gas as I push, @CAPS8 I did a little more then lightly push on the gas. I looked up and @PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. @CAPS2 was the greatest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend had got what @CAPS1 deserved because @CAPS1 wouldn't listen to me. I looked at him and my eyes instantly started to water, I was trying to hold my laugh in, but @CAPS2 just wasn't working. I started to laugh and @CAPS1 looked at me and said, ""@CAPS3 think this is funny?"" @CAPS1 then pulled me out of the car and shut the door and started to wipe mud all over my face, I was laughing so hard that i fell and took him down with me right into the mud. @CAPS8 to make the story even better, we went to go open the doors to the car, and @CAPS3 remember how I told @CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse @CAPS8 when @CAPS1 pulled me out i didn't take @CAPS2 out of reverse, and his car locks when its not in park. I then looked at him and said, "" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 have an extra key on @CAPS3 by chance?"" ""@CAPS6"", @CAPS1 said, ""@CAPS7?"" I looked at him and said, ""@CAPS8 lets see the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car, and @CAPS8 to finish @CAPS2 off the doors are locked."" @CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth dropped. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before anyone came down the road. @CAPS2 took use about forty-three minutes to get the doors unlocked, and then @CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to get @CAPS2 unstuck. When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about @CAPS2 to this day..Let the good times roll..But it would be much better if we could do it together..Prep school hippie   Or hip

"Laughter. Some might think of it as just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality laughter can be many things such as a way to cope with situations, a way to express yourself, or just a simple way to enjoy yourself when you are around friends. For me the meaning of laughing has changed a lot during my lifetime, when I was younger I used to laugh to enjoy myself or just to have fun with peers, but as I have grown older I have used laughter to cope with situations. On @DATE1 the morning of my @NUM1 birthday I found out some disturbing and disappointing news, that day I found out that my mom had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing that I felt I could do was cry and grief about it and shut down into a depressed stage, many of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me that ""things were going to be okay"". I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think was even if things turn out okay things will never be the same. At this time I thought to myself what will @CAPS1 be like? what am I going to do on mothers day?, and my biggest question of all how was I supposed to celebrate my own birthday?. It's hard knowing that someone that I love and had been with for @NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom has passed away I have tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like graduating high school, becoming successful, and not letting my life spiral down hill. Even though everyday for me is hard I still try to push through it and just remember that my mom wouldn't want me to give up on my life over her passing. You might ask yourself how I am coping with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to cope with my situation with laughter. Growing up my mom always told me that ""laughter is the best medicine"". And after losing her I realized that that statement was true.Now whenever I get upset or sad I remind myself to think about the memories that I have had with my mom and laugh about the good experiences and times we had , and I sometimes even find myself laughing at some of the arguments we had. Laughing has been helping me cope fairly well in the past four months since my mom has passed away, and I hope it continues to help in the future, but I continuously think that ""sure I can laugh about things now, but what about in ten years?"" I guess the future is just going to remain a mystery for that, but one thing I do know about my future is that I will become successful, and even if laughter doesn't always work for me I will stay strong and be sure to live my life the way I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard doing it without the guidance and authority of having my mother there, but fortunately I am not dealing with any of this alone.One person that has been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she has been in my life since day one, my mom and I even lived with her. I am grateful that my aunt has been there for me during my life, if she wasn't I don't know where I would be right now, she has taught me that I can't isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mom, but to live life to the fullest and live the life my mom would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is okay and to not keep things bottled up and I am very happy I have someone to go through this with.Having someone there for me in such a tough situation is very reassuring to me. Knowing that I have someone to go to and just talk about the past and be able to have someone to laugh with about it. Laughing is hard when you do it by yourself but one thing that I have noticed is that when you have friends and family that are going through the same situation as you it is easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes it easier to laugh when you have people that you are close to and people that care about you around. In some situations laughter might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might happen to be going through a similar situation is to not stop living your life and be something great and try to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends..The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream..Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving   He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling   He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game   He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same   There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us   So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus      And it's all over now   Don't you worry no more   Gonna go west to the sea   The greyhound is swaying   And the radio is playing   Some blues for baby and me      And the highway looks like it never did   Lord it looks so sweet and so free   And I can't forget that trip to the west   Singing blues for baby and me      Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise   It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky   I called you my child, said honey now this is our game   There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again   There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us   So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus.Talk

"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said "" oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to ""quotidian teens."" I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said "" hello @PERSON3, good luck in track."" @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said ""@CAPS16, you talked to your husband."" We laughed for a long time. @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @CAPS20 music, @CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; @CAPS3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you @CAPS3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you @CAPS3 if it is as @PERSON1 said ""jump of a cliff, @CAPS3 built your wings on the way down,"" or someone will help you built them!  As @PERSON6 said ""come take my hand, we'll walk this road together.""   .a long long way to run   So!.And when you have them all, I think   There's something more I'd bring   The gift of Christmas laughter now   So you could learn to sing...      La la la la, it's Christmas time   Memories everywhere   Singing of hope, peace to mankind   And love is in the air..You know you could   I've tried to see your point of view   But could not hear or

"  I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON1. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry.   One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, ""@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS5 will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""""@CAPS7"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk.  Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it.   When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.   .Upsetter..Good morning baby, guess you wanna touch me now   You wanna put your hands on my face   Tell me you love me,   Tell me you need me   Don't say you love me   Don't say anything...

"So one day I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So go check my email, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I got excited to talk to him becuase I got my phone taken away. I open it, and it was a break up email. It was so shocking. I wanted to cry. So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON1 and tolled her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON1 said yes to comeing over! @PERSON1 is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do, and say when I'm upset. I was waiting for her for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she out doing things. She finally gets to my house, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for one a other. I have always been there when all of @CAPS1 boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as any boyfriends as she had. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river fellowing down my face. Being dumped really is a horriable feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so the he dmped me was very unlike him. @PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was think why are you just texting you should comforting me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So started to talk and we desided to go to the mall. Thats always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She just got home. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere was better any home at that time. So we went back to my room, I was crying again. So @PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew the things weren't true, but it was really really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @PERSON1 making up stupid ex-boyfriend jokes! Laughter is the best way to make everthing better!.But you don't know, you don't know what it's like,   No you don't, no, no, no, you don't know,   Honey, you don't know what it's like   Oh to love anybody..Chicken's on the burner   But wait for me if you can,   I'll be back soon, honey,   Big kiss from mommy..You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there   Wrapped up in a trap of your very own   Chain of sorrow..the fire bombs in distant lands are burning   jarring every synapse in your soul   life and death are a meaningless profession   tomorrow brings a horror yet untold      who can we get to win the fight?.All right   I said you ain't so big, you know you're just tall that's all      Big boss man, why can't you hear me when I call?.Everybody has a real good time.Infinite victims, infinitesimal time   And I'm so guilty for no reson or rhyme..(dance) no!.Concede to what you fear..Oh, magdalene ...

" I think laughter should be a huge part in everyoneas life. For examlpe; laughter has brought my mother and I closer than we have ever been before. One time we were sitting in her camper and we had not been with each other for a whole month so we just let everything out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing about fake teeth, we laughed so hard that I made my mom tinkle her pants. We talked about fake teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, it does me. Laughing is a good way to show someone that you know how to have fun and it's not a bad thing. For someone to know how to laugh and to have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @CAPS1 I'm with all of my friends I can never stop laughing, and I love it because I'm not sad. @CAPS1 I was a little girl my family and I went to disneyland and it was the beast time of my life there was not one moment @CAPS1 I was not laughing with all of them. One thing I don't understand is how someone couldn't be laughing or smiling at least @CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mother and I, We were all tired and had a long day and fake teeth just made us all laugh, and laugh it was the best time I think I have ever ahd with my mother. I have always said to everyone I know ""live life while you can you don't know how long you'll have it."" I think that those words are very true and while your living life, laugh. My grandfather is pretty funny to @CAPS1 he is in a good mood he is always making everyone around him laugh. One time he had seen this commercial and it was a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy I'm your grandpa"" and it said that maybe four times, and ever since he heard that he sings it all over the house. In conclusion laughing is the best way to feel better about anything.

tackle him   I don't want to get hurt   So I pretend to tie my shoe      Once again, I'm ignored by my teammates and all my coaches   ""Go back where you came from!"".Come on."
" Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means their happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling to happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to and them laugh. laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today, We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance now @CAPS2 we want to laugh we need only to pick up remote and turn on the @CAPS1, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to go and see a stand up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the very first time someone laughed comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed. I remember that when ever my parents would have a new friend over then only thing I would hear when they were at my house was then sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing. Soon the new guest was over much more often.  Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more, @CAPS2 you have ever noticed men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them. This and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship. I have herd but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic, sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not felling so good so it @MONTH1 possibly be therapeutic for me. @CAPS2 this is so than people have been going through therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh even @CAPS2 the subject is not funny they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might fell kind of out of place. Everyone has a different laugh some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them, my mother has a very loud and high pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh, no matter what your laugh is like it can help you feel better it can also help you become closer to someone. laughing is just one of life's greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh..It's so funky,   Jane, can't you see?.Fell down like Bocephus under all the noise and grease   Automatic mono-style rip me up, monkey style.I'm hardly sentimental,   Love isn't so

"Library @CAPS1 @CAPS2 past @DATE1 instead of sitting at home doing nothing, I decided to get a volunteer job at the library. Some @MONTH1 say that a library is not a funny place but to my best friend @PERSON1 and I it was full of numerous and humerous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy whom we like to call @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the time that we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided that we were to loud and weren't to nice about telling us. We worked hard in that library but who says you can't laugh a little on the job?  @CAPS3 @CAPS4, by definition it means he is some one who likes to @CAPS3, but @CAPS2 guy was just to funny. One day @PERSON1 and I had just got done working and we were waiting for her grandma to pick us up, when some strange guy sits down and starts staring at @ORGANIZATION1 like he knew her. He then preceded to ask us countless questions like, ""@CAPS6 your names?"" and ""@CAPS7 you guys have boyfriends?"". Being me I didn't say a word and let @PERSON1 talk the whole time. He also kept telling us how beautiful we were, which made us laugh even harder because @CAPS2 situation just kept getting weirder and weirder. Since his nickname is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you can only guess @CAPS6 he asked us next. Oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start a @CAPS3 line in the middle of the library. Thankfully @PERSON1's grandma showed up just in time to save us and we only saw the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 once or twice after that because he moved away shortly after @CAPS2 encounter. Being a spy was one of the most hardest and funniest things that @PERSON1 and I ever did at the library. It all started when we noticed @CAPS2 cute guy sitting all by himself at a table that we could clearly see through some book shelves not that far away. Being the adventurous type I talked @PERSON1 into letting me use her iPhone to take pictures of @CAPS2 guy without him knowing. Now some people would think that that was kind of like a stalker, I just saw as a chance to brush up on my spy skills. After successfully getting a couple of pictures undetected, I decided to get just one more before we went back to the other side of the library to see @CAPS6 we had. I was just about to take the picture when I locked eyes with the guy who was not supposed to see me. We then had to abort the mission and crawl all the way to the other side of the library so he wasn't able to see us again, so that he couldn't confront us about why we were taking pictures of him. The funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were. Normally libraries are quiet, right? Well @PERSON1 and I had a little problem with people wanting the library to be to quiet. On one such occasion a nice looking middle aged women was doing some homework at a table not to far away form where we were sitting. We were watching some videos on @ORGANIZATION1's iPhone and we had the speakers on low. @CAPS2 lady told us very rudely that she wanted is to move somewhere else if we were going to have the volume up because she needed to get her work done. Not one please or thank you were said as we walked away. On a similar occasion an elderly lady who was sitting a few book shelves away form us also asked us to be quiet so that she could finish her book. @CAPS2 time the elderly lady used her manners but she had a very rude tone of voice. On both of these occasions @PERSON1 and I started laughing shortly afterward. @CAPS2 just goes to show how ""nice"" people can be when they want to get something done. All and all that @DATE1 was one of the most funniest summers I have ever had. Whether we were getting talked to by some guy who wanted to start a @CAPS3 line or getting caught trying to spy on a cute guy or even getting reprimanded by not so nice people, we could always find @CAPS1 somewhere. Not many people could say that the library was ever a place where they laughed so much they nearly peed there pants, but @PERSON1 and I can..I've got a woman that's treatin' me better..Lover, Mr. Loverboy?.He worked the field all day..Jumped on the 110   She's flyin' in the Blazer   Like ""Go Speed Racer""   But I ain't gonna chase her   Like Racer X   But I won't flex   Til it's time to have sex   So when you want to get together?.Yeah, that's it, a little more to the right, a little more....

" It was the middle of @DATE1 and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten I still played with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on vacation surfing in @LOCATION1, or roasting marshmallows over the roaring fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring @DATE1 break anyone has ever had until one day in @DATE3. The day I met @PERSON1 was the day I gained my best friend. I met @PERSON1 because of my brother and his sister, they had had crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents but, that also meant that her brother @PERSON1, and I, would have to tag along also. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only chuckled when I would crack a joke here an there. As time went on though, I must have grew on him, because a few days later he was laughing at practically every joke I made.  Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late @DATE2. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his family, and his good friend @CAPS1. @CAPS1 couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and @PERSON1. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because why i hadn't was a good enough reason not to.  We spent half the night talking, and laughing, and really just getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when @PERSON1, and his family moved to @LOCATION2, where they were from. After they moved I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @PERSON1, telling me that they were going to move back.  I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. @PERSON1 came back for about another solid @NUM1 years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to @LOCATION2 again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. @PERSON1 had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes..And when I feel you near me,sometimes I see so clearly..And I need you   To need me

" I have a friend and her name is @PERSON1. I have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class. We have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship. About two years ago for her fifteenth bithday party she invited a couple of her friends and I to spend the day over at her dads house in @LOCATION1. The plan was to hang out, have fun ,and pretty much do whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a pool to swim in, and flatscreen television to watch movies, plenty of board games top go around, and quite a few people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @DATE1 we all loaded up the car around noon and made our way to her dads appartment in @LOCATION1. A short @NUM1 minutes later we had arrived at the appartment complex. We were all so excited to get the entire day to hang out, and have an amazing sleepover for @ORGANIZATION1's birthday. The second that the van had stopped all five of the people that were in the car including me unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up out of the seats to head to the house. Everybody had gotten there seatbelt unbuckled except for @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2. She had thought she heard, and felt the seatbelt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still on she attempted to jump up out of her seat but at the last second the seatbelt caught her by the waste and jerked her back down to her spot. She had layed there with her arms to her sides with her head all the way back against the head rest and moaned for a good ten seconds. This was one of the many events of laughter that had happened that day.  A good two hours had gone by and the five of us were chillin' out in the living room and talking about what to do next. @PERSON1 had suggested ""@CAPS1 guys, we should all go to the pool for a couple of hours, swim, and tan."" The rest of us were all for it concidering the fact that it was probably one hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny, and clear, and because it was @CAPS2 @PERSON1 birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then after the conversation we all got our swim suites on, grabbed our towls, and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed out the door. Little did we know but the blacktop outside was boiling! Of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways. We all then took one step out on the blacktop, and all you could here was screaming, and yelling. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! @CAPS4 feet are on fire!"" @PERSON2 remarked. We had all agreed with her at that very moment of time. Since the blacktop was outrageously hot @PERSON2 started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later @PERSON2 had finally reached the grass and all we heard was. ""@CAPS6!"" all of us looked up at @LOCATION2. She was laying flat on her back because the sprinklers had been on recently and she didnt know so her feet flew right out in front of her and landed on her back. We all started laughing but running at the same time. I helped @PERSON2 get up off of the ground and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess that something else funny happened with @PERSON2..I want to really do it right..This is... in my soul like... set us free!.A poor world, poor world..If I can't have you,   No one will!.Greatest times we ever had, the crazy nights just looking back and laugh..She came on to him like a slow moving cold front   His beer was warmer than the look in her eye   She sat on a stool he said ""what do you want""   She said ""give me a love that don't freeze up inside""      He said I have melted some hearts in my time dear   But to sit next to you, lord I shiver and shake   And if I knew love, don't think I'd be here   Asking myself if I have what it takes      To melt your icy blue heart   Should I start   To turn what's been frozen for years   Into a river of tears      These days we all play cool calm and collected   Why, our lips could turn blue shootin' the breeze   But under the frost thought he detected   A warm blush of red and a touch of her knees      He said girl you've a beauty like I've never witnessed   And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air   But I've felt the cold follow the first kiss   And there's not enough heat in the fire burning there      To melt your icy blue heart   Should I start   To turn what's been frozen for years   Into a river of tears      To melt your icy blue heart   Should I start   To turn what's been frozen for years   Into a river of tears.Ball Tongue!.y'all want me to stop?!.I used to hang my head down low   Never knowing which way I was going   My life was getting close to the edge   And I knew that it was showing      Because of you   I can stand and hold my head up high   Because of you   I feel free and yet I don't know why      Each morning is a spring time song   With the sun up in the sky   The sadness that is on your face   Helped me to realise   I owe each day I have to you   And I'll pay you back some day   You're reading me like a book   But I really would like to say      Because of you   I can stand and hold my head up high   Because of you   I feel free and yet I don't know why      Yes I do, it's you   And I'll pay you back some day   Because of you   I have finally found my way.Get your hot rods ready to rumble,   Cause' we're gonna drink until we die..Many nights, I've stood here by this window   Wondering if I'd always be alone   No one here to share this lonely bedroom   But that was long before she came along      Heaven only knows she's not an angel   But I was blessed the day she came to me   And when I close my eyes and lay beside her   I'll swear I can almost hear her wings      I never stopped to watch an evening sunset   Or tired to count the stars up in the sky   I never knew the world held so much beauty   Until I saw it through my baby's eyes      Heaven only knows she's not an angel   But I was blessed the day she came to me   And when I close my eyes and lay beside her   I'll swear I can almost hear her wings      And when I close my eyes and lay beside her   I'll swear I can almost hear her wings.'Cause just wishing is all I do   When it comes to you   How many lives can you live through?.We sit alone and talk and watch a hawk   Makin lazy circles in the sky      We know we belong to the land   And the land we belong to is grand   Yippi-i   Yippi-i   Yippi-i   Yippi-i   Yippi-i   Yippi-i      And when we say   Yeow!.It's snowing on this beautiful music   And when I'll earn a present tonight, you gonna be the one, listen to me now   Go Judith   ...

"                                  ""@CAPS1 @DATE1"" @CAPS2 my brother graduated @CAPS1 year it was a great time in our lives . We all were having fun daily because it was like my brother didn't have rules any more this made him a lot more fun to be around. At the beginning of the @DATE1 my brother and I were going fishing almost daily with our friends. It was a very fun for all of us. We all got to hang out and stay connected because there is nothing ells to do in our small town except for go to the lake and fish for bass.   @CAPS2 he graduated everyone close to the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother however couldn't decide what she wanted to get him. @CAPS2 she saw us always going up to the lake to go bass fishing she had an idea, she would send my brother and a couple of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to here her plan. They spent many hours searching for a place for him and his friends to travel to. They decided on going into the deserts of @LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp at.  I myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother. Little had I known my brother was planing on taking me with him. He told me his plans of who he would be taking a couple weeks before it was time to depart. I was so excited! My brother said we would be taking our friend @PERSON1 on the trip with us witch was cool because he is a fun person to be around. He was so so happy @CAPS2 we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than us.   Immediately @PERSON1 ran out to the garage to get his camping and fishing gear ready for the trip as did we @CAPS2 we got home that night. Two weeks later we all departed for a two week trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in eastern @ORGANIZATION1 before we even found the place we were going to stay at we went to a huge reservoir to go fishing. @PERSON1 almost caught a huge @NUM1 inch bass however his line on his fishing rod broke. My brother and I laughed at him and he was mad.  We spent the first night on the side of the road in the near freezing dry @LOCATION1 air because we had accidentally gone a day early and our camp sight was occupied in the campground. We were unhappy about it at the time but now we look back on that night with great laughter. The next few days went by with much fun. We met some collage students from @ORGANIZATION1, they were very chill people to hang out with we all joined around the camp fire and told jokes. We laughed for probably a half an hour @CAPS2 one of the guys told us about some funny collage party things that had happened. @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a very interesting @DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.  .Look around you find the ground   Is not so far from where you are   But not too wise   For down below they never grow   They're always tired and charms are hired   From out of their eyes

" ""@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. ""@CAPS2?"" @PERSON3 asked tentavely. ""@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. ""@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond..All these bitches on me feenin'..Spend forever looking, all the time wasting   Soon as I throw my hands up and say I quit   Turn the corner and there my future sits   Hello, good evening      Clearly she was out with her girls alone (That I could tell)   Beautiful barely any

word   Every gesture      And my heart, in my mouth   Like I'm fallen out of bed   From a long and vivid dream   Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying      And as that woman blows her

stay on it   And get back under      And if you think this is over   Then you're wrong   If you think this is over   Then you're wrong   If you think this is over   Then you're wrong      (Wake me up, wake me up)   If you think this is over   Then you're wrong   (Wake me up, wake me up)   Like I'm fallen out of bed   From a long and vivid dream   Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying      When at last you'll give in   When at last you'll give in      Wake me up   Wake me up   Wake me up   Wake me up   Wake me up   Wake me up.Save, the blame..I couldn't live   I couldn't live without your love   For one kiss   Well I'd give everything up   There's no words I can describe   What I feel deep inside   So I let this song say it all      Then I hope you'll understand   Once you've listened 'till the end      Heard the music in my head   So before I could forget      I start singing   Yeah I was singing   This song   For you      Just made up the words   La la la oh, oh, yeah   My heart with a melody      So I am singing   This song   For you.A winter's day in a deep and dark december   I am alone   Gazing from my window to the street below   On a freshly fallen , silent shroud of snow      I am a rock I am an island      Don't talk of love   Well, I've heard the word before   It's sleeping in my memory   Don't disturb the slumber   Of feelings that have died   If I never loved, I never would have cried      Chorus      I build walls   A fortress deep and might   That none may penetrate   I have no need of friendship   Friendship causes pain   It's laughter and it's loving I disdain      Chorus      I have my books   And my poetry to protect me   I am shielded in my armor   Hiding in my room, safe within my womb   I touch no one and no one touches me      Chorus      And a rock feels no pain   And an island never cries      Chorus x 2.Fuck you go away!.Floatin' round my brain,   Tryin' to think about the other thing..Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,   Flickers above us, to light up the sky..Things go wrong, though are strong..Too late for the other side   Caught in a chase   Twenty five to life   Too late for the other side   Caught in a chase   Twenty five to life   Yeah   Too late   I cant keep chasing 'em   I'm taking my life back   Caught in a change   Twenty five to life      I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made   Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed   But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid   Down and died for you I no longer cried for you   No more pain bitch you   Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet   Into the dirt I can no longer stand it   Now my respect I demand it   I'm a take control of this relationship   Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit   And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me   So you better hear me out this much you owe me   I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed   Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid   Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess   Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet   Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect   I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness   And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left   But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step   And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath   You know what you've done no need to go in depth   I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left   I'd laugh while you wept   Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me   Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said   But a special place for you in my heart I have kept   Its unfortunate but its      [Chorus]   Too late for the other side   Caught in a chase   Twenty five to life   Too late for the other side   Caught in a chase   Twenty five to life      I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh   Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half   Til I snap   Don't think I'm loyal   All I do is rap   I can not moonlight on the side   I have no life outside of that   Don't I give you enough of my time   You don't think so do you   Jealous when I spend time with the girls   Why I'm married to you still man I don't know   But tonight I'm serving you with papers   I'm divorcing you   Go marry someone else and make 'em famous   And take away there freedom like you did to me   Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you   Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat   I'm moving on forget you oh,   Now I'm special?.Oh I repeat   Well don't you think that's kind of neat?.(And they) set an example for us (I see it!)..That's where love lay bleeding, licking at its wounds   The times were never changing, sticking to their guns   She thought she really meant it, that's the honest truth   She felt it in her marrow, she felt it in her boots   After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire      The man she married, he was something else   He adored the chaos, smashing all the delft   The man she married, he was something else   He had the sudden notion it's time to call a truce   It's time to lead a quiet life for the love of Jesus   Let's sit down together, and engage in talks of peace   After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire      He was Irish Catholic, she had English blood   They met in a good restaurant, they gave the secret nod   She ordered fish and lentils, he the kidney stew   She played with bold impulses, wine turned his lips blue   They left in separate taxis to the same address   In case someone was watching, and there they did confess   After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire      It was all the others' fault, they thought at any rate   After the ceasefire to put an end to hate   She was reaching for her knife, he a fork and spoon   They sat about devouring the poison of the moon   Shared a fatal cigarette neither one would light   Their breath was flame enough, nobody said goodnight   After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire      After the ceasefire that they swore would last   They had the strange idea of living in the past   That's where love lies bleeding, licking at its wounds   The times are never changing, sticking to their guns   They sit about devouring the poison of the moon   The times were never singing the same tune   After the ceasefire [Repeat: x4].What am I gonna do on Wednesday night   When I used to call you on the phone,   What am

"                                                         Laughter and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 Laughter is the key component in anything in life. @CAPS2 is able to turn any sad moment good and any great moment even greater. Here is an example in which laughter brought my boyfriend and I together. I had been crushing on the same guy, @PERSON1, for two months. I was way too nervous to speak to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When i saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me they heard from a ""little bird"" he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me into him then ran off. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in an awkward silence. All I did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes. All i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans. He probably thought i was a freak. He had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg. Then when he went to switch to his left leg he let out the biggest fart i have ever heard. We started laughing. After we had settled down from laughing hysterically, we started talking. We ended up talking for two hours. A couple weeks had gone by and we had been talking more and more each day. Another week had flew by and we went to our first movie. I called @CAPS2 our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Ever since the day he farted I have thanked @CAPS5 for @CAPS2. I wouldn't have him as my boyfriend if @CAPS2 weren't for him braking the ice with his embarrassing moment. Most of all I thank my friends for shoving me into him that day. There could not have been a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much @CAPS2 @CAPS3 change or affect a situation. Laughter is the medicines of all medicines. @CAPS2 is one of the most important tools a person @CAPS3 have..Like a dog   That just pissed on your barbecue   Sick of me      Losing faith   And you still don't know what to do   Sick of me      Loss of love   Now you hate everything and you're   Sick of me      It's a waste   But we still keep on trying, you're   Sick of me      Wandering out the door   I am on to you   You're comin' back for more   Am I losing you?.I want to go outside, go outside, go outside, in the rain,   Can't let you see me like this,   No baby, I don't want you to know,   I don't want you to know, that I'm cryin,   Crying, over you..If you go, you know you'll grieve me   All in life on you depends   Am I guessin?.Do you hear me?.You took all my pain and erase every stain..I'd like to talk to him about the law..No you can't fool the children of the revolution..Can you truthfully say with your dying breath?.And so it must be for so it is written   On the doorway to paradise   That those who falter and those who fall   Must pay the price!.sicka than your average   Money too long can't stash it   In the closet or the mattress   Paper, stretch like elastic   Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it   So the price for that, never ask it   Just sign my name or pop plastic   Hating ass cops wanna harrass em   Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion   Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses   And they left breast (yes!).Tell me how to win your heart   For I haven't got a clue   But let me start by saying I love you.Please don't laugh at me   When I tell you   I believe in love,   'cause it's still   The only thing that   There is too little of..You've done me no right,   But you've done me some wrong   Left me lonely each night   While I sing my sad song      Look out!.When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape   Oh I'm wishin' I had what I'm takin' for granted      I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong   Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck   Over and over and over again      [Chorus]   I'm sorry for everything, no, everything I've done   From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun   And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved   Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved      [Bridge]   In the mean time, we let it go   At the road sign we used to know   We can let this drift away   Oh we let this drift away   At the bay side, we used to shore   In the moonlight, we let it go   We can let this drift away   Oh we let this drift away   Cause you've always got to change your mind   Cause you've always got to change your mind   Oh love, can you hear me?.'Cause Emma I'm for you   Emma I'm for you      Dinner bells and loaded gun   Innocence is bound to run   Enemies are playing from   But don't you touch that golden sun      Innoncence and sentiment   Is owned by hope it's where you're at   Baby is my love too old for you?.You may think that I'm talking foolish   You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free   You may wonder how I can promise you now   This love that I feel for you always will be   But you're not just time that I'm killin'   I'm no longer one of those guys   As sure as I live, this love that I give   Is gonna be yours until the day that I die      Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever   Forever and ever, amen   As long as old men sit and talk about the weather   As long as old women sit and talk about old men   If you wonder how long I'll be faithful   I'll be happy to tell you again   I'm gonna love you forever and ever   Forever and ever, amen      They say time take its toll on a body   Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray   Well, honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair   And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway   They say time can play tricks on a mem'ry   Make people forget things they knew   Well, it's easy to see it's happenin' to me   I've already forgotten ev'ry woman but you   Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever   Forever and ever, amen      As long as old men sit and talk about the weather   As long as old women sit and talk about old men   If you wonder how long I'll be faithful   Well, just listen to how this song ends   I'm gonna love you forever and ever   Forever and ever, amen   I'm gonna love you forever and ever   Forever and ever, forever and ever   Forever and ever, amen.No....For when we march, your sword rides with me..Seal the door..I used to love you girl   I... don't care... no more about your face   No you... make me mad... the way you cat around   With your lips, your legs   And all your sexy ways   Do you got another lover now   Do you think it's me you're foolin' now   No... no   (Chorus)   Oh....I should be on my way   I really ought not stay   Far too strong with the pinnup on   Hear my conscience -I'm gone!.I let that fool come in and tear our world apart..Donatella      (I'm smokin em on

goodbye   I could have done without it      Won't somebody tell me now   How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares   And another thing I would like to clarify   Is how can farewell be fair   I could have done without it      Ah, you and I could never say this is goodbye   Girl, well it makes me so sad   Until it's got to be bad   Tell me what's so good about goodbye   I could have done without it      What's so good about goodbye   Baby, baby what's so good about goodbye   You said goodbye to me   All I've known is misery   But if everything goes wrong, lovers stay so long   Tell me what's so good about goodbye   I could have done without it      Won't somebody tell me now   How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares   And another thing I would like to clarify   Is how can farewell be fair   I could have done without it.Moving along in our God given ways,   Safety is sat by the fire,   Sanctuary from these feverish smiles,   Left with a mark on the door,   Is this the gift that I wanted to give?.How wonderful to know you really love me   How wonderful to know you really care   How beautiful to feel my arms around you      Kissing your eyes   Hearing your sighs   Touching your hair      How wonderful to know sunshine and laughter   That fills my empty heart with love divine   To share this life with you now and hereafter      How wonderful to know that you are mine   To share this life with you now and hereafter   How wonderful to know that you are mine.And the giant leap so fragile that it hardly made a sound....lost   I'm l.o.s.t."
" Laughter is what I'd like to call a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3"". Because no matter what language or tongue you speak, when something funny occurs, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for all people, and when it takes place; it's contagious and helps to bring everyone together. Laughter also emits a sense of happiness and joy, which in return makes people feel more free and open to join in and laugh as well. In many instances, if there is an awkward situation at hand, laughter plays a big role in lightening the mood; and making the atmosphere a little more comfortable. In @DATE1 laughter was a big key in the success of our annual @ORGANIZATION1.  Our @ORGANIZATION1 consists of around @NUM1 people (including cousins, and some close friends); so as you can see it @MONTH1 not be easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to switch it up, and sit next to relatives that you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first, it's usually very awkward, and sometimes even frightening for the younger kids, when they end up to sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That is until my @LOCATION1 decides to crack one of his hilarious jokes.  My @LOCATION1 is somewhat of a @CAPS4 of awkwardness. Not necessarily that he enjoys being in awkward situations, but rather that he enjoys watching them play out. Eventually about halfway through the meal, after eating in close to utter silence; he decides to stand up and give a little toast to the @ORGANIZATION1. Following the speech, he always concludes with a well rehearsed joke; which, gets everyone laughing. Some of the younger cousins don't always understand the play on words. But what really gets them going, is listening to all of our aunts and uncles hoot and holler things like ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 help me"" mixed in with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun dies down, the awkwardness always seems to drift away, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe that those feelings directly correlate to lightening the mood, and in helping to get everyone more comfortable with who they happen to be sitting by. Once all these things occur, conversation gets flowing and everyone ends up getting to know a @ORGANIZATION1 member, that they otherwise might have not gotten the chance to truly meet. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very dull and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations, and to make them better for the most part.  In @DATE1, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, just like it has done so many times since then. In my eyes, laughter is the best @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 out there. If you really want to get to know a person, all you have to do is make them laugh!.No raging Cajun crawfish stew, fat batter coming in a Lumalamalu..Smile you smile is you and I   See through your laughing eyes   The smile you smile is you and I   See through your laughing eyes   Oh, baby   In the whirlpool of them, I   Can be in paradise      I'd go roamin' in the gloamin'   And ever and a day with you   Oh yes, I will   I'd go roamin' in the gloamin'   And ever and a day with you   Oh baby   Sit between the stars and say   That's my point of view   Oh yes      I yi, yi, yi, love you      I yi, yi, yi yi, love you      In the purple heather   On a hillside mountain fog we'll stray   Oh yeah   In the purple heather   On a hillside mountain fog we'll stray      Oh yeah   An' chase the colored grass   Around us in the same old way      I yi, yi, yi, yi love you, baby   I yi, yi, yi, yi love you, oh yeah..Yo, Nate, Yo, Nate Woohoo   Frontin', they frontin', everybody's frontin'   Violent Violent J is gonna tell ya something      If ya know a bitch who got grits   Kid Rock, Kid Rock will probably eat that shit   Boohoo motherfucker what'cha cry for   I'm that nigga that your bitch would die for   The whore showed up at my front door   So I fucked her in the ass and I threw her out the back door   The bitch thought it was a cake drive   She said drive me to the city, so I dropped her off at lakeside   You driving me home, well I meant ta   But plans have changed so get your ass on the centaur   Hoe, this ain't no taxi I be mackin' hoes, they don't mack me   Never slacking, hoes I be macking   Kid Rock, Kid Rock Never slacking, hoes I be macking      Violent J serving ghetto hard street shit   The funk, the funk from the old days   Violent J serving ghetto hard street shit   The funk from the old days      Well, I'm up for the shot in a minute   Show me a valley, I might yodek in it   Like somebody else I know I been to Mount Plen   as I've been to Romeomeomeo   Wicked clowns gonna flow for ya son   Three for the treble, eight for the drum   Five for the homies that I run with   Bitch call your mother cause you're done with   Toe tip-toe, I snuck in your house   And fell asleep butt-naked on the front couch   So, excuse me, pops, I'm napping   So could ya shut the fuck up with that yapping   And your wife's all worked up for nothing   She act like she ain't never seen a wang or something   'cause it really don't matter I'm a show my nuts to innocent bystander   Every fucking day   'cause it's about time I say      Kid Rock, Kid Rock, is that you?.Jillian was her name   She was sweeter than aspartame   Her kisses reconfigured my DNA   And after that I never was the same   And I loved her even more   Than Marlon Brando loved souffle   She was gorgeous, she was charming   Yeah, she was perfect in every way   Except she was always using the word ""infer""   When she obviously meant ""imply""   And I know some guys would put up with that kind of thing   But frankly, I can't imagine why   And I told her, I said   ""Hey!.And I'd like to stay but I can't because   I've been fooling around and I know   That you called because you never even knew   That it was hurting me..How can you breathe?.You didn't phone when you said you would!.I will light the match this mornin' so I won't be alone   Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone   Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend I'm free to roam   Oh I will make my way through one more day in, hell   How much difference does it make   How much difference does it make yeah      I will hold the candle till it burns up my arm   Oh I'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired   Oh I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind   Hey, I won't change direction, and I won't change my mind   How much difference does it make   How much difference does it make, how much difference      I'll swallow poison, until I grow immune   I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room   How much difference   How much difference does it make.No more pain..Well, you know that I'll beat you   If I ever meet you I'll control -

"          Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self . In my opinion.                         Laughing is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing about funny things. Laughing also make you feel close too people because once you and that person get to know each other you'll just laugh about anything even if its not that funny.For example when i first meet people i am very shy, I don't really say much but if the person that i am talking to makes me laugh, it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke around with them, it makes the conversation fun.  If there is no laughter in a relationship the relationship is practically dead. No one wants to be around a person with no sense of humor. In my opinion everyone has a funny side, some people like to show it and some people like to keep it to themselves. Some people might be funnier but the things is we can all be funny in our own way.  I've had many experiences where laughing has benefited my relationship with people. Me and my friend met in middle school ,I was good friends with his sister but i never really got to know him until I went to high school. I had a lot of classes with him so i started talking to him, but because i already knew him I wasn't very shy. The first day that I talked to him at school he was making fun of me but not an a mean he was joking around how I brought chocolates to his house and I didn't offer him any , it was more of like an inside joke. The thing is our relationship started off with us laughing and joking around. So I immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think. Now we are best of friends,we laugh about everything and we have are own little inside jokes.When I am talking to my friend I can say anything that I think is funny and I know he will laugh at it. Laughter has really made my friendship with my friend fun. One of the best relationships I have with a person is with my sister and its because we just laugh all the time when we are together . When either of us is going through a ruff time we still find a way to make each other laugh and forget about all our problems for a while. Even though we are sisters and we naturally have a bond, laughter just makes are sisterly bond ten times better. We have very similar personalities, and we are both pretty funny so the laughing never stops between us there is always something we laugh about.  Laughing in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship, without laughter it would be a miserable, unhappy relationship. Laughing brings out the good side of people in most cases, it brings out truth in people. when you first meet people, laughing really makes conversation comfortable and not awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can really make you good friends for example like my friendship with my friend. When you are sad or mad,it really makes you feel better when you have someone that makes you laugh it just makes everything better it really can change some peoples mood and make them forget about the negative stuff in their life for a while. Laughter is just a great way to bond with people. Having someone to laugh with is just very important to have in life..Eurgh! ).I used to be not what you see now, lord I try   And now it seems all those dreams have come true, but they're passing me by   Some fast talkin' mama goin down to put a smile on my face   I'm drivin' all night   I end up in the same old place      My gypsy road can't take me home   I drive all night just to see the light   My gypsy road can't take me home   I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright      And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky   I'll take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers cause I always get by   Some fast talkin' jerk wiped the smile off my face   I'm drivin all night   Just to keep the rat in the race      My gypsy road can't take me home   I drive all night just to see the light   My gypsy road can't take me home   I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright      Sometimes I feel so old   Got my lights burnin' bright   But I'm lookin' pretty sold   Sometimes I feel so cold   So cold   Lets go      Got to get on home   My gypsy road can't take me home   My gypsy road can't take me home, t-t-take me      My gypsy road can't take me home   I drive all night just to see the light   My gypsy road can't take me home   I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright      My gypsy road can't take me home   I drive all night just to see the light   My gypsy road can't take me home   I keep on p-p-pushin'   My gypsy road   My gypsy road   My gypsy road   My gypsy road   My gypsy road.I count the falling tears   They fall before my eyes   Seems like a thousand years   Since we broke the ties   I call you on the phone   But never get a rise   So sit there all alone   It's time you realize      I'm not your fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   I'm no fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   Never again, no, no      You take your road, i'll take mine   The paths have both been beaten   Searchin' for a change of pace   Love needs to be sweetened   I scream my heart out, just to make a dime   And with that dime i bought your love   But now i've changed my mind      I'm not your fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   I'm no fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   Never again, no, no   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   I'm no fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool      I count the falling tears   They fall before my eyes   Seems like a thousand years   Since we broke the ties   Ohhh      I'm not your fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   I'm no fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   I'm no fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   I'm no fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool      Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool      Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   No, nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   No, nobody's fool   Nobody's fool   Nobody's fool.No equation to explain   Destiny's hand   Moved, by love   Drawn by the whispering shadows   Into the mathematics   Of our desire.Son, and heir..I think I've been hit by cupid   No one needs to know   Right now..My old dad went a walkin' one day,   Pushing tall weeds right outta his way,   My old dad went a walkin' one day,   Hey now, hey now      Corduroy pants and an old plaid shirt,   Daddy went a walkin' just to feel the earth,   Got a little dirty but that's all right,   Hey now, hey now      Old man crossing the road,   You've got to let him go,   Old man crossing the road,   He's feelin' fine      Daddy went a ridin' in his old car,   Took the dog with him 'cause it ain't too far,   Daddy went ridin' in his old car,   Hey now, hey now      Brown leather boots and an old straw hat,   Daddy's getting wood with the barnyard cat,   Got a little dirty but that's all right,   Hey now, hey now      Old man crossing the road,   You've got to let him go,   Old man crossing the road,   He's feelin' fine      Mama's waiting   At the top of the hill,   They'll be laughing,   Oh the stories they'll tell....(Ah, pretty girl -

"Laughter A true story that involves @CAPS4 and laughter was when i was hanging out with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiance @PERSON4 (who is a profesional quad racer) at a @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2. The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM1 because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS11. A lot of things made @CAPS4 laughlike when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert and it wasnt as good. But it was still awesome..All you need is love, all you need is love,   All you need is love, love..Pa rum pum pum pum, (yeah)   Ra pum pum pum, (yeah)   Ra pum pum pum (yeah) (I'm gonna get straight

the remains in an unmarked grave in your heart      With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness   With the warmth of your arms, you saved me   Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you   The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb   I'm killing loneliness      Nailed to the cross together   As solitude begs us to stay   Disappear with a lie forever   And denounce the power of death over our souls and secret brings us in to start a war      With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness   With the warmth of your arms, you saved me   Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you   The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb   I'm killing loneliness      Killing loneliness   I'm killing loneliness   With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness   With the warmth of your arms, you saved me.See the pyramids along the Nile   Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle   Just remember, darling, all the while   You belong to me..All the

Park, died of some anemia   No one raped her, poor Deloris   Just detained her and drained her on the spot      Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast   Is all he's living for   And he craves it more and more   Old men, ladies of the night walking in the rain   If they walk alone are never seen again      Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me   Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me   Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me   Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me      No one calls and no one visits   We're like a couplet out of Desolation Row   We don't want them to want to know us   Cause when they do, they get a little bit too close      Fresh blood, a sanguinary feast is all I'm living for   and I crave it more and more   Bad girls, cops on the beat in the midnight rain   If they're out alone, are never seen again      Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me   Fresh blood inside of me, cry to me   Fresh blood it goes through me, flows through me   Fresh blood

could you think we don't need you   I'm tired of running away from the fear and the day   That our life has no meaning   Without a word or a reason   Like a coward, you're leaving      I can't believe this is me   I wasn't wont to believe you   I feel I'm lost in a dream   Between what is and what seems   Having to face not to need you   How could you do this to me   How could you think we don't need you   I'm tired of running away from my fear of the day   That our life has no meaning   Without a word or a reason   Like a coward, you're leaving.You should see you're headed for a

my accomplishments beside her   Still I seemed so obsolete and small   I found god and all his devils inside her   In my bed she cast the blizzard out   A mock sun blazed upon her head   So completely filled with light she was   Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad   Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled   And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle      [Chorus]      She had a heart full of love and devotion   She had a mindful of tyranny and terror   Well, I try, I do, I really try   But I just err, baby, I do, I error   So come find me, my darling one   I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs   Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun   Blood running down the inside of her legs   The moon in the sky is battered and mangled   Band the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle      [Chorus]      All things move toward their end   I knew before I met her that I would lose her   I swear I made every effort to be good to her   I made every effort not to abuse her   Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles   And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle      [Chorus].Entering your mind.....How many times must I tell her   How many times must I say   I won't be around to pick her up again   From now on she'll have to find her own way..I weave with brightly colored strings   To keep my mind off other things   So, ladies, let your fingers dance   And keep your hands out of romance      Lovely witches   Let the stitches   Keep your fingers under control   Cut the thread, but leave   The whole heart whole      Merry maids can sew and sleep   Wives can only sew and weep   Falling in love with love   Is falling for make-believe   Falling in love with love   Is playing the fool      Caring too much is juvenile fancy   Learning to trust is just   For children in school   I fell in love with love one night   When the mood was full   I was unwise with eyes   Unable to see      I fell in love with love   With love everlasting   But love fell out with me.Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,   And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust."""
" Laughter to me seems like the foundation of a relationship; if it is a relationship with your parents, best-friend, or your spouse, it can all be formed with a single laugh or giggle. I have seen on @CAPS1 that when a guy try's to ""pick up"" or ""hit on"" a girl, most of the time he will try to be funny to ""break the ice"". When that so called ""ice"" is broken the air is open for both people to start showing each who they are.  My best friend and I have been friends for five years now and I hope that we will be friends for more years to come. @PERSON1 (my best friend/and only friend) has shown me how to be myself @PERCENT1, with her and try to with others. Together @PERSON1 and I have had many funny adventures together, that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Just recently @PERSON1 and I went snowboarding at @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2. @CAPS3 was her second time going snowboarding and I have been snowboarding for about three years now. I promised her that I would stay and help her on the slopes until she got the hang of the board under her feet, I also promised that I would fall down with her when she fell. When we got there I showed her how to clip her bindings on, what the stomp pad was used for, and also how to skate. The word skate means that your foot boot is in the front binding and your left foot is not, you push your back foot on the snow to slide or skate on to the ski lift. It took us three hours to get down the first bunny hill slope, normally it takes a person no more than ten minutes to get down. While teaching, laughing , and bonding with @PERSON1 I noticed that when I laugh with her I get feelings of love, caring, and happiness. Laughing with her always makes my day. In fact that is how we became friends; was by laughing together. After we got of the slope she said some words to me that I will not forget, ""@CAPS2 you are the best friend I could ever ask for, if you were a man I would marry you and have your children, I love you."" @CAPS3 meant a lot to me, for @PERSON1 is the kind of person that keeps her feelings of love and caring inside. @CAPS3 was the first time she has ever said she loves me. Laughing together for five years now has made it so that @PERSON1 feels more open with me, enough to say something that she never told to her family. Laughing and even giggling together is what @PERSON1 and I look forward to in our relationship. .Though people say I must..Yessur!.Stutter step through another trap set by deception   Mention rejection   Always lies in your eyes   Settles in your action   Jeopardize everything that I want   And I won't compromise anything anymore   In any way victimize myself any more   Liberty (yeah)      Manipulations on my mind   Expectations well defined   Frustrate me   Liberate me      Cause everything's falling apart   You can't control me, You can't control me   Everything's falling apart   Now I can't see you   Doesn't matter what I do   I can't see you      Cause everything's falling apart   I got exposed to a deeper form of infection   Shout out ""I need acception""   Always lies in your eyes   Settles in your action      Criticize everything that I do   And I will overcome anything that's in store   Nevermore look up to you and adore   Liberty (yeah)      [Chorus]      Manipulation is on my mind   Inspect me, try to check me   Expectations well defined   Dissect me, want to wreck me   Violator of my own will   Accept me- reject me   Separate or shoot to kill      [Chorus].Only a figure on a lamplit wall   Never realized he cared at all   Did he stop you going on?.Woman is a devil,   That's what I've been told..Verse Two   Uh-uh-uh-uh huh..procrastinate it   Can wait, I put it off..I know you must sometimes   Think I don't care   Or even appreciate   What we share      Though I'm no one's   Stepping stone   The truth is I love you   And I'd go crazy   Alone      You may think I'm strong   And I can do no wrong   But I'm vulnerable   So vulnerable   Without you      I may be hard to take   But you can call me fake   'cause I'm vulnerable   So vulnerable   Without you      So vulnerable without you.Strong enough to answer to the call   Ruby closed her eyes and faced the heavens   She said, ""take me to the stars one more time""   I was doin' eighty, but I pushed her through the floor   And watched her climb   Outta sight, outta mind   Chorus:   I know I'm still wild enough for you   And you know you, you can always count on me   Baby, we used to be worth fighting for   So tell me, are we?.I've been talking to a friend of mine,   He says making money's just a waste of time..You are the angel glow that lights the star,   The dearest things I know are what you are..I got this feeling deep inside my love   Overwhelming feeling but I know not what   One thing's for sure I ain't got time for those   Who can't relate   You gotta learn to love the midnight madness   You gotta revel in the good and badness   If yin n' yang is your thing   What I gotta do to try and reach ya   Is it for real or just a double feature   So let's go throw the I ching   You gotta love it   You better own it   You gotta love it   And god knows it   You gutta shu uh shove it   I'm gonna make things happen   Goin' round n' round n' round....Eye to eye nothing left to say   But will you really throw it all away..You can tell me how your feeling   Every single word   I was having trouble sleeping   Like the early bird   Who just want's to be heard   CHORUS   Why don't you come over   I can't stop thinking of you   Why don't you come over   My heart won't rest ""till you do   pick up the phone   Your clothes from the floor   The sleep in your eyes   And walk through the door   I'll turn on the light   Why don't you come over   Why don't you come over   Why don't you come over tonight   VERSE 2   We can sit down at the table   Let your problems drown   I know how to get you smiling   How to be your clown   There's no need to think about it   Just come as you are   I'll be waiting by the window   For my shining star   You know it's not that far   CHORUS   Pick up the phone   Your clothes from the floor   The sleep in your eyes   And walk through the door..Looking up at the sky   Cursing a wandering star   Well if I were you   I'd throw rocks at the moon   And I'd say, ""Damn you wherever you are""      I don't know where to start   This cage round my heart   Locked up what I meant to say   What I felt all along the way   Just wondering how come   I couldn't take your breath away      [Chorus]   'Cause I never sent roses   I never did enough   I didn't know how to love you   Though I loved you so much   And I should have sent roses   When you crossed my mind   For no other reason   Than the fact you were mine   I should have sent roses      Looking back on my life   If fate should decide   I could do it all over again   I'd build no more walls   I'd stay true and recall   The fragrance of you on the wind      You'll get better than me   Someone who can see   Right from the start give it all that you need   And I'll slip away   Knowing I'm half the man I should be      [Chorus]      Should have sent roses.You laugh at all my school girl fears...

" When I think of laughter you think of memories you shared with people. When I was about six my family and I went to my cousins ranch in @ORGANIZATION1. The happest time started with us pulling up to the house as I slowly open my eyes from the long car ride seeing the porch light on. I quickly grabbed up all my toys and some playing cards and waited eagerly at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family are getting the suitcases. My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I walk under his arm to set down my toys in the living room when I saw @PERSON1 sleeping on the coach. He was my best friend in the whole world and I always looked forward to seeing him everythime. He had brown hair always wearing wranglers with a trucker hat and his plad tucked in shirt. We always played gold fish together every time I came over, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started to run twards him when my other cousin @PERSON2 grabs me and starts to tickle me tell I fell on the floor and was screaming of laughter. My laughing woke up @PERSON1 as he came running to me picked me up off the ground and saved me from @LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @CAPS3 tell I feel asleep.  The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside while the sun was coming up, when I smelt bacon and eggs coming from the kitchenI shot up to eat breakfast. My dad and all the boys went out to go goose hunting on the farm. Around lunch time while my mom and @PERSON3 were cooking up some hamburgers the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready right then so @PERSON1 and I startded to play gold fish tell we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went out to the hay barns to find all the rattle snakes and bull snakes curld up by the bales. Almost every foot step we took there was another snake curld up in the bales. Every time @PERSON1 would tell me to jump back to shoot the snake in the head. After hunting @PERSON1 figured we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started to walk to the back yard. I wasn't to sure what he was doing tell we got in the back yard and @PERSON3 jumped out of her chair and started running to the house. Everyone started to laugh when @PERSON1 cut her off and she was running in a circle in the back yard. @PERSON1 finally let her go in the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visite in the house. @PERSON1 and I headed to play more gold fish at the table for the last time of my visit.  The next morning we woke up at five to start working on the farm. I went back to sleep in the tractor tell they were done. When we were done we started loading up all are clothes in the car and gave everyone a hug good bye as I stood by @PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she picked me up and put me in the car. As we pulled away I looked back to see them all waving good bye.  After we visited @DATE1 we got a call from my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 with some bad news. @PERSON2 was heading home and saw @CAPS5 truck on the road but when he pulled up he saw that he killed himself two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral that @DATE2 and when it was all done I sat in @CAPS5 room and only could remember all the laughs we shared. I knew to always laugh and always to remember the great times I had with one true my best friend. My memory of him hasn't gone away after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live to the fullest. He taught me so much from the little time he was he but whenever I need a laugh I think of the last time I saw him..Who was broken by trained personnel..Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together,   There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning..The darkness bleeds violent sights   It purges from within   Death, it holds you in its arms   And kisses you goodnight      Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes   Oh, oh, oh, I feel its bite   Oh, it purges from within      It's over, it's over   This haunting, it's over   They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed   Inside a dream      It's over, it's over   This haunting, it's over   They cut my wrists and watch me bleed   They stop haunting me      The darkness bleeds violent sights   It purges from within   Death, it holds you in its arms   And kisses you goodnight      Oh, oh, oh, the darkness comes   Oh, oh, oh, I feel its bite   Oh, it purges from within      It's over, it's over   This haunting, it's over   They cut my wrists, and watch me bleed   Inside a dream      It's over, it's over   This haunting, it's over   They cut my wrists and watch me bleed   They stop haunting me.I got to find myself..One very familiar type of song is the christmas carol..Guernica is in fact made of stone backwards..Kill dah wabbit!.And when the world began   I'd been asleep forever   I opened one eye   'Twas then it was I   Got the

One sang to greet the dawn   One pursed his lips and spoke      Wake up and hear the music   Wake up and hear the music play   Wake up and hear the music   Wake up and hear what the people say      I heard the heavens sing   Predicting Marty Robbins   I knew I'd find   Music and time   Were the perfect plan      I watched my son sail on   A little ship a-bobbin'   I had to grow   I needed to know   Exactly who I am      And as the ocean warmed   And from this dream we woke   One sang to greet the dawn   One pursed his lips and spoke      Wake up and hear the music   Wake up and hear the music

 She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes,   Well, it's just an invitation to the blues      And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth   At the counter of the Schwab's drugstore   You wonder if she might be single, she's a loner and likes to mingle   Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue      She said How you gonna like 'em, over medium or scrambled?,   You say 'anyway's the only way', be careful not to gamble   On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting out of here   It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes   This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues      But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java,   It's just the way she pours it for you, joking with the customers   Mercy mercy, Mr. Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey   But a broken-down jalopy of a man I left behind   And the dream that I was chasing, and a battle with booze   And an open invitation to the blues      But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candy-apple Caddy,   And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things   He probably left her for a socialite, and he didn't 'cept at night,   And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared   So they took the registration, and the car-keys and her shoes   And left her with an invitation to the blues      Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving

hear some boogie like I'm gonna play   It's just an old piano and a knockout bass   The drummer man's a cat they call Kickin' McCoy   You know, remember that rubber-legged boy?"
" I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON2 was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience. One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @PERSON2 and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE1 when we would meet again at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 where we could do it all over, and make new memories..In His purpose I will stand..I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name   I had your love on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came   My eyes held a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command   I had your love on the tips of my fingers but I let it slip right through my hands      But I let it slip right through my hands   Somebody took you when I wasn't looking I should've known right from the start   It's a long long way from the tip of my fingers to the love hidden deep in your heart To the love hidden deep in your heart      Somebody took you....But I can't have both of them   Don't know what to do..It's so easy to destroy and condemn   The ones you do not understand   In your life, why didn't you ever try?.Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year, oooo..Time has come to live our lives in harmony..Why do you why do you think they call it dope?.Hear that bluebird, up in a tree   Hear him, what a song   Joy he's bringing, singing to me   Singing, all day long   Goodbye to skies of gray   For I'm back home today...   All day long I jump and run about   You can always hear me shoutin' out   ""Hello bluebird!"".I need you more than you know   Ask me to do anything but go   I can hardly talk, afraid I'll cry   Just can't bring myself to say goodbye..Just call Lonesome 7-7203   Had our number changed today although I hated to   But each time the phone would ring they'd want to speak to you   And it hurts to tell them you're not here with me   Maybe now oh telephone will let me be   It's not in the book now so you'd better write it down   Just in case your love for me should ever come around   You might want to call and break the news to me just call Lonesome 7-7203   I keep the telephone beside me all the time   Hoping you might want to call and say you're changed your mind   If you do then darling you know where I'll be I'm at Lonesome 7-7203   You're the only one I'm giving our new number to   So now if the telephone should ring I'll know it's you   If you ever long for love that used to be just call Lonesome 7-7203   Just call Lonesome 7-7203.Hey hey..They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot..Goodnight baby,   Same time tomorrow, same time tomorrow,   Goodnight baby,   See you here tomorrow, see you here tomorrow..Lo)The nights I've waited up for you   Promises you made about coming through   So much time you wasted,   That's why I had to replace you      (Ll Cool J)It makes a chap nervous the thought of settling down   Especially when he's creeping all over town   I thought my tender touch could lock ya down   I knew I had you as cocky as that sounds   The way you used to giggle right before I put it down   It's better when you're angry come here I'll prove it now (come here)      (J..But in living color, I'm a real neat guy (Data bank)   Oh!.Used to be a rumour goin' round,   The people tried to run my man outta town..You've got your love tripping all over me,   The only thing I can say is uhuuu,   I don't wanna wait,   Just open up my... ,   It's yours, come get it, get it uhuuu      Chorus:   Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like?.Now we put you through the changes   And turned around the mood   We hope it's struck you different   And hope you feel moved   So forget about your troubles   As we search for something new   And we play for you.We past that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree,   The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me..With dreams so warm so soft so deep..Once there was a time I'd rob my mama   For a good meal and a smoke   Once there was a time I'd sell my brother   For a dollar when I was broke      But I'd never sell my guitar   And my strings were always sharp   Cause if I don't have a guitar   I'll be strumming on some angels harp      And if I don't get to heaven   And I go down there below   Better be a guitar when I get there   Or, I will refuse to go      Once there was a time I was hungry   And I'd find my food in some bin   But I'd never, never sell my guitar   Cause that would, darling, that would be a sin.Please don't take your love from me..For me this is the end..It's pretty bloody sad,   But isn't it a drag?.I thought that, if you paid, you'd keep them off our backs   But I don't care   Baby, I'm not scared      What have you got to hide?.See all the people   With hatred in their eyes   I can't help thinking that   It's only a disguise   Cause underneath that core   There's got to be more   That what we realize      Maybe they're scared   To let the inside out   Maybe they're afraid to   Show what they're all about   So they put on a heavy front and hope that no one else   Can work them out   So they pull on all the heaviness   But it's only an illusion heaviness   Can't you see   They're scared to   Show a little bit of emotion   In case a little bit of emotion   Gives them away      Look at that lady dancing around with no clothes   She'll give you all her body   That's if you've got the dough   She'll let you see most   Anything but there's one thing   That she'll never show   And that's a little bit of emotion   A little bit of emotion   In case a little bit of emotion   Gives her away   But it's a shame she's acting that way   Somehow she's gotta get through every day   And the only way   Is not to show one little bit of emotion   A little bit of true emotion   In case of a little bit of emotion   Gives her away      People learn their lines   And they act out their part   Then they talk on cue   But it's got no heart   It's all on the surface   And it's all contrived   They're scared to come out   Somehow they've got to survive      Look at that looney   With a smile on his face   He knows no shame   And feels no disgrace   He's got a look in her eyes   That makes it seem that he's from outer space   Maybe that looney knows what's it's all about   He's got something to say   But he can't spit it out   He's uncoordinated so we shut him out   In case he shows a little bit of emotion   A little bit of real emotion   We're afraid to see a bit of emotion   So we walk away   Show a little bit of real emotion   Show a little bit of emotion   We're afraid to see a bit of emotion   So we walk away.The first noel   The angels did say   Was to certain poor shepherds   In fields where they lay   In fields where they   Lay keeping their sheep   On a cold winter's night   That was so deep      Noel, noel, noel, noel   Born is the king of israel      They looked up   And saw a star   Shining in the east   Beyond them far   And to the earth   It gave great light   And so it continued both day and night      Noel, noel, noel, noel   Born is the king of Israel      And let us all   With one accord   Sing praises to our heavenly lord   That hath in heaven and earth of naught   And with his blood mankind hath bought      Noel, noel, noel, noel   Born is the king of Israel      Born is the king   Born is the king   Born is the king.Fade away..Drone!.baby, baby, we love your pants   All aboard for Fun Time   (Fun!).Smack that bitch

"One time I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was going crazy. She would run up and down the stairs as fast as she could and no one had any idea why. I thought it was so funny, but @PERSON1 was getting super mad at @PERSON3. So eventually @ORGANIZATION1 into her room to see if she would calm down, but to her dismay @PERSON3 did not. She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder I laughed. It was like the most funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life. This dog had obviously gotten a hold of some kind of energy source to be this happen. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was, but @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something. So @PERSON1 and I went down stairs to see if her mom @CAPS1 knew why @PERSON3 was acting so ridiculous. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON3 never usually acted this hyper before. Then @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister came down stairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running to fast to catch her and was way to crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON3 back in @ORGANIZATION1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but to sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog. To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3, she was just insanely hyper and out of this world that @TIME1. So after @PERSON3 had calmed down about @NUM1 hours later, @PERSON1 and I went on a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4 and I was trying to explain to him the story of how @PERSON3 went crazy that @TIME1 and they didn't find it as funny as me. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining it to him, they had warned me I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing way to hard to notice and I fell. That was like the icing on the cake of @TIME1. I just sat there on the ground and laughed, and so did they. It was pretty funny! I haven't laughed that hard since then. The end..You're mine now!.I'm just a wandering on the face of this earth   Meeting so many people   Who are trying to be free   And while I'm traveling I hear so many words      Language barriers

" Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION2 from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS4 horse called @CAPS4 @CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS6 know that @CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing. .[CHORUS   But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,   Won't be back for many a day,   My heart is down, my head is turning around,   I miss all my friends in Kingston town.].God, I wish someone would shut that bloody guitarist up, its dreadful..So if you call...   Yeah, if you call....Soon, the lonely nights will be ended,   Soon, two hearts as one will be blended..Just let me say how much I love You   Let me speak of Your mercy and grace   Just let me live in a shadow of Your beauty   Let me see You face to face      And the earth will shake as Your Word goes forth   And the heavens will tremble and fall   But let me say how much I love You   Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend      Just let me hear Your finest whispers   As You gently call my name   And let me see Your power and Your glory   Let me feel Your spirit's flame      Let me find You in the desert   Till this sand is holy ground   And I am found completely surrendered   To You my Lord and Friend      So let me say how much I love You   With all my heart I long for You   For I am caught in this passion of knowing   This endless love I've found in You      And the depth of grace, the forgiveness found   To be called a child of God   Just makes me say how much I love You   Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend (x2)      Just makes me say how much I love You   Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend.You change your mind like Mollie dyes her hair   Yeah, you pms like a bitch I would know

"                              @ORGANIZATION1                                    @DATE1 for my @CAPS1 birthday we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for a week, @CAPS16 was so much fun when we got there but the drive was not fun at all. When we got to the house that @TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS16 was coming down so hard @CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS16 seriously looked like @CAPS16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS9 get @CAPS16 because my @CAPS17 was ""too tired"" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like ""@CAPS2 who are these boys?"" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS16 was my cousin @PERSON1, his best friend @PERSON2 and his other friend @CAPS3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS16 was funny because my whole @CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled""@CAPS4"" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like ""@CAPS5 great she is out here"". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON2 knew why i was doing @CAPS16 but @CAPS3 and @PERSON1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them ""@CAPS7"" and that irritated them so @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you"", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS16 so i told him ""@CAPS9 ahead"" @PERSON1 started to @CAPS9 but then @PERSON2 grabbed him,@CAPS10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS11 the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME1 and @PERSON1@NUM1 and @CAPS3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS11 @PERSON2 and @CAPS3 screaming at @PERSON1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE1 old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME1 they were not home @CAPS14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS15 and @LOCATION3, @CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS17, @CAPS18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS16 kind of sucked but @CAPS16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS16 was not fun at all but my @CAPS17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS16 was so fun being at @LOCATION1 we have made @CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS9 this @DATE1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE1 and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!.But today there is no day or night   Today there is no dark or light..Bitch, who do you love?.I took my car and drove it down the hill by your house..Frosty, the snowman was a jolly happy soul   With a corncob pipe and a button nose   And eyes made out of coal      Frosty, the snowman is a fairy tale, they say   He was made of snow but the children know   That he came to life one day      There must have been some magic   In that old silk hat they found   For when they placed it on his head   He began to dance around      Oh Frosty, the snowman was alive as he could be   And the children say he could laugh and play   Just the same as you and me      Thumpetty, thump, thump, thumpety, thump, thump   Look at Frosty go, thumpetty thump thump   Thumpety thump thump, over the hills of snow      Frosty, the snowman knew the sun was hot that day   So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun   Now, before I melt away""      Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand   Runnin' here and there, all around the square   Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""      He led them down the streets of town   Right to the traffic cop   He only paused a moment   When he heard him holler, ""Stop""      Because ol' Frosty, the snowman, he had to hurry on his way   But he waved goodbye sayin', ""Don't you cry   I'll be back again some day, I'll be back again some day   I'll be back again some day"".Gone..If these are the bullets that every father and son must chew,   Well then hold me my daddy, I forgot to say I love you..The time I like is the rush hour, 'cause I like the rush   The pushing of the people, I like it all so much   Such a mass of motion, do not know where it goes   I move with the movement and, I have the touch      I'm waiting for ignition, I'm looking for a spark   Any chance collision and I light up in the dark   There you stand before me, all that fur and all that hair   Oh, do I dare, I have the touch      Wanting contact   I'm wanting

wanting contact   I'm wanting contact with you   Shake those hands, shake those hands   Give me the thing I understand   Shake those hands, shake those hands      Pull my chin, stroke my hair, scratch my nose, hug my knees   Try drink, food, cigarette, tension will not ease   I tap my fingers, fold my arms, breathe in deep, cross my legs   Shrug my shoulders, stretch my back - but nothing seems to please      I need contact   I need contact   Nothing seems to please   I need contact.His manager sat in the office alone   Staring at the numbers on the telephone   Wondering how a man could send a

If you go away, If you go away      If you go away as I know you must   There'll be nothin' left in the world to trust   Just an empty room full of empty space   Like the empty look I see on your face   Can I tell you now as you turn to go   I'll be dying slowly till your next hello   If you go away, If you go away, If you go away      But if you stay, I'll make you a night   Like no night has been or will be again   I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch   I'll talk to your eyes that I-I love so much   But if you go, I won't cry   For the good's gone from goodbye   If you go away, If you go away, If you go away.If loving you is wrong I don't want to be right   If being right means being without you   I'd rather live a wrong doing life   Your mama and daddy say it's a shame   It's

" A while back my mom had decided to send me to @DATE3 camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, @CAPS1 I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly @CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of @CAPS2. Playing @CAPS2 at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing @CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play @CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE1 we played the silly little game of @CAPS2, and just giggled and laughed. @DATE2 came along the second @DATE1 of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing @CAPS2. We played it so much the first @DATE1 that we just called it ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2"" instead of @CAPS2. Like other things we got tired of @CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE1 was so boring so we played @CAPS2 again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the @DATE1 all of us really became friends.  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the @DATE1. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all @DATE1 missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @DATE4 the @DATE1 of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the @DATE1 @DATE1 of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When @DATE1 time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost @TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, @CAPS1 we where leaving in the @TIME2. There was one @DATE1 thing we had to do, and it was one @DATE1 game of @CAPS2. We played for about in hour, @CAPS1 another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play @CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, @CAPS1 we all became friends by just playing @CAPS2 and laughing together..But in the end he needs   A little bit more than me   More She needs security   He needs his fantasy and freedom   I know him so well..Once upon a time there was a girl   In her early years she had to learn   How to grow up living in a war that she called home   Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm   Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face   Every time my father's fist would put her in her place   Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room   Hoping it would be over soon      [Chorus]   Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same   And I still remember how you kept me so afraid   Strength is my mother for all the love she gave   Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday      And I'm OK      I often wonder why I carry all this guilt   When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built   Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door   The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""   Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done   To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on      [Chorus]      It's not so easy to forget   All the marks you left along her neck   When I was thrown against cold stairs   And every day I'm afraid to come home   In fear of what I might see there      [Chorus]      And I'm OK   I'm OK.I don't know how you feel   But for me it's getting hard   Swimming in the deep blue sea   Marching in the big parade      All I need is a little shade   Standing in the light of love   Standing in the light of love      Doesn't matter who you are   Or who you're not   All it takes is a little love   To make a handout worth a lot   Swimming in the deep blue sea   Marching in the big parade      All I need is a little shade   Standing in the light of your love   Standing in the light of love      Drowning in the deep blue sea   Drudging in the long parade      All I need is a little shade   Standing in the light of your love   Standing in the light of love      Standing in the light of love   Standing in the light of love.I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things..[Fagin]   Take a tip from Bill Sikes   He can whip what he likes..[Chorus]   No no no   You don't love me and I know now   No no no   You don't love me so let me go now   (I can't let you go, can't let you go)   If you ask me, baby   I should've left you a long time ago, no      Playas gonna play   At least thats what they say   Well I know that for myself now   (You know I love you)   You said you loved me babe   Then you played your game   A game that I know all too well now   Well I used to buy your lines   But it's time for me to sail now      [Chorus]      First you tellin me no   But please tell me yes   Without some of this stress   Straight up tell me yes   Gimme the keys to ya chest   Ya chest will rise neva rest   As ya chest you got me feelin like i'm climbin on Mount Everest   Hey Rihanna   Your lovin really put me to the test   But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes   Yes to this yes to that yes to whateva you suggest   So please say yes   No no no      [Verse 2]      Haters gonna hate   (Let them hate)   I found out much to late   I think I know we're a little hot now   The truth leads to the lies   The heart ain't always right   And I see that love is blind now   Boy you use to have my trust   Without no trust there ain't no us boy      [Chorus].It is strange to sleep alone   In a place no one knows   Strange to shelter under stones   In a place water flows..Take your children down to the water wash their heads and sing, holy holy   Last night I dreamed you were standing there, strong and tall beside me..And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy   No matter what I say or do   There's just no getting over you      And I miss you, baby   I miss you baby   All the tender love you gave me   When a feeling gets this strong   I know the real thing will come along   And I miss you....Cos you're keeping me up all night      I don't wanna rock, DJ   But you're making me feel so nice   When's it gonna stop, DJ?.Falling out the window   Tripping on a wrinkle in the rugfalling out of love, dear   It hurt much worse when you gave up      Just don't tell me which way I

it is a razer   That leaves your soul to bleed      Some say love, it is a hunger   An endless, aching need   I say love, it is a flower   And you, it's only seed      It's the heart, afraid of breaking   That never learns to dance   It's the dream, afraid of waking   That never takes the chance      It's the one who won't be taken   Who cannot seem to give   And the soul afraid of dyin'   That never learns to live      When the night has been too lonely   And the road has been too long   And you think that love is only   For the lucky and the strong      Just remember, in the winter   Far beneath the bitter snows   Lies the seed, that with the sun's love   In the spring, becomes the rose.I miss my ice cube   Purty little ice cube   Since she's withdrawn      I held her in my hand   My chilly little ice cube   Was it wrong?.Shackled by a heavy burden   'Neath a load of guilt and shame   Then the hand of Jesus touched me   And now I am no longer the same      He touched me, Oh, He touched me   And Oh the joy that floods my soul   Something happened and now I know   He touched me and made me whole      Since I met this blessed Savior   And since he cleaned and made me whole   I never cease to praise Him   I'll shout it while eternity rolls      Oh He touched me, oh He touched me   And oh the joy that floods my soul   Something happened and now I know   He touched me and made me whole..I'm gonna give you more   Than you've ever dreamed possible..Want you in this yearning that I feel   Tell me that it's so, what I want to know   Tell me that you're real.Hey broken clock,

"When you laugh, is @CAPS5 out of habit, or is @CAPS1 cause? What are the causes for laughing? Is @CAPS1 even such a thing as a ""cause"" for laughter? I'm sure that if you were to get a scientist's opinion, you would be given an in-depth, technical explanation for the cause of laughter; but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles? Certainly not! The true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, a senseless action, a misunderstanding? @CAPS5 can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two. @DATE1, @CAPS3 older sister @PERSON4 and I unknowingly went out on an adventure. We were headed to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to visit our very best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON3, who happened to be almost completely identical to @CAPS3 sister and I in personality; @PERSON2 being like @PERSON4 and @PERSON3 being like me. Now, whenever the four of us got together, @CAPS1 was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with; all we knew was that hanging out together @CAPS8 failed to brighten up our days and put a smile on our faces. This particular day, both @PERSON3 and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and up-lifting spirits. She and I had both been going through a rough patch with some friends at our schools (oddly enough, we were both having friendship issues with someone named @PERSON1, and we didn't even go to the same school), so after some discussion between both of our sets of parents, they agreed to have @PERSON2 pick up @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 pick me up, and well all meet somewhere to take our minds off the antagonizing situations were were both suffering through. We decided to meet in @LOCATION2, at @PERSON2 and @PERSON3's house. When we pulled into their drive way, I could feel @CAPS3 body being filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped inside some kind of storage container inside of me that was too small to hold all the contents that were being held inside. Before the car engine was completely turned off, @CAPS3 seat belt was off and I was half-way out of the car door. I slammed @CAPS5 shut once @CAPS3 body had slithered its way free and ran for the door. To @CAPS3 surprise, @CAPS5 was unlocked! I pushed @CAPS5 open obnoxiously yelling, ""I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!"" @CAPS1 was a cry of laughter that filled the room. I hugged both of them in one tight squeeze, and almost as if @PERSON3 and I had our very next move planned out, we immediately began chattering about the incidents that had occured that day as we took a seat on the couch. All that could be heard was, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! I have to tell you what happened today!"" and "" I can't believe she said that!"" or ""...and she said...and then I was like...so then she says...""@CAPS5 was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama-ridden teen straight out of the movies. Things were going as they normally would have; @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 dwelling close to @PERSON3 and I in the dining room locatated at the far end of the couch where she and I sat, still completely involved in our similar freshman-year-of-high school worlds. They were completely immersed in their own conversations of old memories we'd had together. All of a sudden @PERSON2 shouts, ""@CAPS2! @PERSON3 and I baked you brownies!"" @CAPS7 off guard by his intejection, we all once again fell into laughter, although this time, making our way toward the kitchen in search of said brownies. When we arrived, @CAPS1 sat a pan of brownies on the middle counter. @PERSON3 uncovered @CAPS5 and gave us each a napkin with which a brownie sat on top. We stood together, leaning against the tile counters, enjoying our brownies and the company of one another. Suddenly, @CAPS1 was a dull moment; no one was saying anything. As if to fill the silence before a timer ran out, @PERSON2 blurted out, ""@PERSON4, do you wear a wig?"" @CAPS8 in our lives have any of us laughed as hard as we did at that moment. @PERSON3 fell to the ground, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 were leaning upon each other for support to keep from falling, and I was completely doubled over, trying desperately to keep the sip of milk I had just taken inside of @CAPS3 mouth. Minutes creeped by, and we were still laughing at the off-key remark. To this day, @PERSON4 and I remenise upon that afternoon and the laughter that was shared upon us and our very, very best friends. .Did ya, did ya, did ya ever think?.I'm looking like a zombie..Ever since I was a kid in school   I messed around with all the rules   Apologized, then realized   I'm not different after all      Me and the boys thought we had is sussed   Valentino's all of us   My
