 The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it.. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.

" The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up.

Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up."
"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .His latest book, High Performance Habits, was a Wall Street Journal best-seller and named by Amazon as one of its top three best business and leadership books of 2017..Whilst touring, Martyn's gig at the Collegiate Theater, University College London was filmed by the BBC and transmitted on The Old Gray Whistle Test on 10 January 1978..It has been involved in some capacity in most of the National Research Council target areas, i.e. precision measurements and tests of fundamental laws, ultracold physics, the development and application of ultra-intense, short wavelength light sources, ultra-fast quantum control of atoms, molecules and electrons, nanoscience, and quantum information science..He served as the company's chief executive officer from its founding until May 2012 when Stearns named Brian Hale, former president and national production executive of MetLife Home Loans, as CEO.Stearns was featured on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest growing private companies in America in 2013, 2014 and 2015..” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  "
"The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine.The simplicity in the RSpec syntax makes it one of the popular testing tools for Ruby applications..Goddard said that the test showed Cobb to have 14% sub-Saharan African ancestry..The Liquid Roofing and Waterproofing Association (LRWA) is a UK member organization of manufacturers of liquid applied coatings for buildings, protesting 1 w e al coatings contractors and associated trade suppliers..The club's women's team also contested its second season of the AFL Women's competition, finishing last out of the eight teams in the competition, and the club will field a team in the VFL Women's competition for the first time..

And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future."

She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening.He is the son of the author Richard Bach, and is the brother of Jonathan Bach, who is also a renowned software tester..It governs public education and manages funding and testing for local educational agencies (school boards)..He is best remembered for blowing the full-time whistle five minutes early during the All-Ireland semi-final between Offaly and Clare in 1998, prompting Offaly fans to stage a sit down protest in Croke Park..It was developed by Ronald Pies, and was later refined and tested by S.

Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about."
"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly.The protests subsided after the Indian government announced a package of measures aimed at defusing the tensions in September 2010..Since that first match, over 130 Tests have been competed..Usually two couples have a spouse tested by actors and / or actresses, if the spouse may or may not be accused of infidelity to the other spouse..Unlike Westmoreland Eastern, which was phased out when the constituency boundaries were redrawn in 1966, this seat remained and has featured in all 16 contested Parliamentary General Elections 1944 to 2016..

For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.” @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."
"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior.The defending world champion was Norway's Ola Vigen Hattestad while the defending Olympic champion was Russia's Nikita Kriukov..Alberta clippers take their name from Alberta, the province from which they appear to descend, and from clipper ships of the 19th century, one of the fastest ships of that time..The Czermak-Hering test is a vagal maneuver consisting of the application of external digital pressure to the carotid sinus..Edward Ledlum ( born 15 June 1999), commonly known as ""Testa"", is a Liberian footballer who plays as a forward for LISCR FC FC in the Liberia First Division.. She said ‘’when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     "
"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life.The Leaf-Chronicle achievement that has perhaps received the greatest acclaim in recent years is its continuing to publish every day after downtown Clarksville and its printing plant received a direct hit from a powerful tornado in January 1999..The test takes about 45 minutes..They contested the final on later occasions in 1924, 1925, and 1929..These are the best match bowling figures in English women's test history.. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     "
"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more.Jennifer Turner (born 5 September 1969) is a New Zealand former cricketer who played six times in Women's Test cricket and 30 times in Women's One Day International cricket..Kumyk participated in the Turkvision Song Contest for the first time at the Turkvision Song Contest 2016, held in Istanbul, Turkey..She made her international debut at the age of 14 and played for Bengal in India's domestic league prior to her international appearance She played a total of 12 Tests and 26 ODIs..Although they were difficult to sail downwind and a technical board to sail upwind, they are still the fastest 12 foot board upwind in up to 8 knots of breeze.. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."
 I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden.. Without no friends just let in her mom
" The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is.Matches were contested over 50 overs per side and have List A status..Of the 250 contestants that took part, the series' competition was won by Timothy Shieff..David Valentine Lawrence (nicknamed Syd) (born 28 January 1964, Gloucester, England) is a former English cricketer, who played in five Tests and one ODI for England from 1988 to 1992..Their latest album, Wrong Meeting, was released in April 2007, with Wrong Meeting II following a month after.. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test."
"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring.. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life."
"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam.She contested Indian general elections from Barabanki Seat of Uttar Pradesh..In 2012, Whelchel participated as a contestant on the CBS competitive reality series Survivor: Philippines and tied for second place..Cyprus participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 with the song ""Alter Ego"" written by Minus One and Thomas G:son..The Australian national cricket team visited Pakistan in October 1964 and played a single Test match, which was drawn, against the Pakistani national cricket team.. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become..In June 2008, CNET UK listed Nupedia as one of the greatest defunct Web sites in the still young history of the Internet, noting how the strict control had limited the posting of articles..Testify is a remix EP by The Damned, released by Cleopatra Records in 1997..It was frequently used in the northeastern United States and upper Midwest in the early 19th century; the greatest concentration of surviving cobblestone buildings is in New York State..Jason Edward Riche Gallian (born 25 June 1971 in Manly, Sydney, Australia) is a former English Test cricketer... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas."
 The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around..
" The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ’’Winter Hibiscus’’ with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over…’’ In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding… connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ’’take that test again…’’ By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ’’@CAPS1 of loss.In the Triple J Hottest 100, 2012, Thundamentals' Like a Version recording of fellow Australian Matt Corby's ""Brother"" came in at number 49..The shortest term occurred on March 17, 1905, a day when the state had three governors: Alva Adams won the election, but soon after he took office, the legislature declared his opponent, James Peabody, governor, but on the condition that he immediately resign, so that his lieutenant governor, Jesse McDonald, could be governor..Ayres's work on broadcast Doctor Who was during Sylvester McCoy's era as the Seventh Doctor, comprising The Greatest Show in the Galaxy, Ghost Light, and The Curse of Fenric..In 2005, St. George was ranked the second fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, surpassed only by Greeley, Colorado..’’ and to her grief.

"The author concludes the story with thise paragraph so that we buy his comming book, or so that we get more exited.."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives.

The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that’s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can’t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now”. Saeng didn’t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won’t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories.

With Saeng’s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."
"The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.The group was founded in 2002 by a group of pediatricians, including Joseph Zanga, a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as a protest against the AAP's support for adoption by gay couples..The scientific name testata is derived from the Latin testa (baked stone) and refers to the base color of the wing..Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public..Connie Smith's Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 consisted of ten songs that had been hit singles by Connie Smith, including her #1 hit single, ""Once a Day,"" and ""Ribbon of Darkness"", among others..The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes."
"The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything’s going to be alright.

Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it’s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph."
 The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring.. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.
"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”.. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."

Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that."
"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months.He was ranked number 20 on NME's 50 Of The Greatest Producers Ever list..Each group was contested at a specific venue and all teams in the same group played against each other one time for a total of 5 matches per team, one match per day..Acts of Timothy (Acta Timothei) are a work of New Testament apocrypha, most likely from the 5th century, which are primarily concerned with portraying the apostle Timothy as the first bishop of Ephesus and describing his death during a violent pagan festival in the same town..For predictive validity, the example is slightly different: Tests are administered, perhaps to job applicants, and then after those individuals work in the job for a year, their test scores are correlated with their first year job performance scores.. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     "
 So she did not forget to take the test again..
 Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter..
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it.""

Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."
"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying.Down Rope is a coastal area on the southeast coast of Pitcairn Island in the south Pacific, to the east of the Aute Valley and north of Break Jim Hip, it lies on the eastern side of an inlet and contains large petroglyphs on the rock face, testament to the Polynesian settlers of centuries ago..Fault grading is a procedure that rates testability by relating the number of fabrication defects that can in fact be detected with a test vector set under consideration to the total number of conceivable faults..At the beginning of the series, 32 single women are contestants seeking romance with any of three single men (firefighter/paramedic Michael Sarysz, real estate broker Robert Kluge, or college student Jojo Bojanowski)..The advent of Test cricket coupled with social change in the 20th century saw its importance decline, especially in the aftermath of the Second World War..

"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world.He took a total of 46 wickets in the five Tests, a record in an England-Australia series..Satisfied Customer - testimonials from supposed happy customers of Unnovations who never actually mention the names of the products they've bought..Roughly 26% are followers of traditional forms of Protestantism (Congregationals, Methodists, Baptista, Lutherans, Reformed), but over the last decades there has in addition been a growth of Pentecostal communities and African Initiated Churches..She started entering surf dog contests in 2010.."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .Although they were the first multi-party elections in the country's history, both contesting parties claimed loyalty to President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow..The EarthCraft Program was created in 1999 as a partnership between the Greater Atlanta Home Builders Association and Southface Energy Institute and teaches builders the latest methods of resource and energy-efficient construction..The contested seat is currently held by Sen.

"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion.He has contested various general elections, first for the Labor Party and later for the National Party, coming second each time..Due to the culture of Pakistan, only men were allowed to take part in this season which caused some protest within Pakistan..The International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) was organized in 1915 by J.

It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."
" The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring.

"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .Although the site has been in use since the 1380s at the latest, the present building was constructed in 1907, replacing an earlier house of 1842..Hasaitic is an Ancient North Arabian dialect attested in inscriptions in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia at Thaj, Hinna, Qatif, Ras Tanura, Abqaiq in the al-Hasa region, Ayn Jawan, Mileiha and at Uruk..In October 2010, he and 100 other leading artists signed an open letter to the Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt protesting against cutbacks in the arts - he created a new work, ""Reckless"", for the protest..The name Skatestopper is a registered trademark of Intellicept of El Cajon, California, but in some skateboarding circles it has become a genericized term referring to any anti-skate device..This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."
"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1.By the end of June, Angela Eagle and Owen Smith were being promoted as intending to contest the leadership..It reached #98 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1999, Australia's largest annual music poll..The system provides photographic coverage of air-to-air, air-to-surface or surface-to-air test operations..On February 12, 2013, the International Olympic Committee decided to strip Oleg Perepetchenov of his 2004 Olympic bronze medal after both probes were retested and showed traces of anabolic steroids.. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once.. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1."
"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing.

Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it.Megapsyrassa testacea is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae..The Supreme Court enunciated the test for determining when a state statute is in irreconcilable conflict with Section 1 of the Sherman Act in Rice v.

Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way."
"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".As of 19 August 2017, it has hosted nine Tests and 14 ODIs..Anthony Hollis Gray (born 23 May 1963) is a former West Indian cricketer who played five Tests and 25 One Day Internationals..8 events (6 men's and 2 women's) were contested..In the book, Smolin controversially claims that string theory makes no new testable predictions; that it has no coherent mathematical formulation; and that it has not been mathematically proved finite..This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."
"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will.As a critical method, mimesis criticism has been pioneered by Dennis MacDonald, especially in relation to New Testament and other early Christian narratives imitating the ""canonical"" works of Classical Greek literature..David Alan Black (born 1952) is Professor of New Testament and Greek and the Dr. M.

So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again.Since only illegally produced heroin is likely to contain 6-MAC, testing for the presence of it in the urine can be used as a fairly reliable method of detecting the use of illicit heroin, as opposed to prescription painkillers..SPARQ has formed a broad, non-exclusive partnership with Velocity Sports Performance to provide certified SPARQ Testing at all of their centers..This global presence is important because these solutions are deployed worldwide, primarily in industrial automation, military, aerospace, medical devices, digital media, and test and simulation software..The list includes books such as the I Ching (ancient Chinese text), the Old Testament (the first part of Christian Bibles), the Upanishads (ancient Indian philosophical texts), Candide (a French satire from the Age of Enlightenment) and The World as Will and Idea (a German philosophical book).. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."
" I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive.It has hosted international cricket matches since 1899, the first Test at the ground took place in between Australia and England in late June of that year. and has been home to more than 90 Test matches in total..Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, one of the highlights of Comicon was the Saturday all-night film show, as well as regular events like quizzes and a fancy dress contest..Siradj cited a fatwa that prohibited praying in the street as the protesters had planned since it disturbed the peace, though his position was immediately opposed by Indonesian Ulema Council, an organization specifically of religious leaders which includes Nadhlatul Ulama leaders..Nel started skating in 1994 and earned a Bronze medal at the X Games in Los Angeles in 2003 and a Silver medal at the FISE contest in France in 2003.. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life."
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was.SAT Subject Test in Physics, Physics SAT II, or simply the Physics SAT, is a one-hour multiple choice test on physics administered by The College Board in the United States..The high level of similarity among the metabolisms of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats in the study of the human diseases..Tacitus writes that he was ""renowned and popular with his countrymen,"" but after a long reign, he ""became a tyrant, and the enmity of neighbors, joined to intestine strife, was his ruin."".He also made 62 test appearances for the All Blacks between 2002 and 2009.. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test."
"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination.In 2012, Ohden appeared in a political advertisement sponsored by the Susan B.

"
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year.John Ngugi Kamau (born 10 May 1962), is a former Kenyan long-distance runner, often called one of the greatest cross country runners of all time and winner of the 5000 meters at the 1988 Summer Olympics..According to the liner notes of the album, ""Protest Songs was originally to be released in December 1985 and chronologically belongs between Steve McQueen and From Langley Park to Memphis."".The contestants, who won medals, had been beaten by Kaija with several minutes just few years earlier..The test for determining this differs depending on the type of trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."
"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her.He successfully contested the 2006 general elections in St. Lucia and is a first term Parliamentarian..The CSU contests elections only in Bavaria, while the CDU operates in the other 15 states of Germany..The latest Communicator model, the Nokia E90 Communicator, is part of the Nokia Eseries..Additionally the US Navy facing by 1948 a serious threat to its large carrier building fleet and demands for a larger peace dividend by putting even its latest Iowa battleships into reserve, as was done to all but USS Missouri before the Korean war, had found the USS Alaska and USS Guam with only a single rudder could hardly turn within the turning circle of Iowa and constituted some greater risk of collision.. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:– “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  "

This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story."

It shows her getting used to the new home"

It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. "
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same.. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph."
" In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”.

"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person.Furthermore, newly invented pharmacologically active moieties may have poor druglikeness and may require chemical modification to become drug-like enough to be tested biologically or clinically..In ODIs, Gibbs scored centuries against 10 different teams, including all nine Test-playing teams..The idea was not pursued wholeheartedly due to its total ineffectiveness against even the lightest tankettes of its era, and took second stage to the then current anti-tank rifles and later weapon developments, such as the Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck..Show of Hands have received widespread critical acclaim over their 30 album (and continuing) career, and in 2006 were voted ""Greatest Devonians Ever"" in a poll run by Devon Country Council beating Sir Francis Drake, Agatha Christie and Chris Martin amongst others to the title.. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again” because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng."
"The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles.. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time."

She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else."
"The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring.The ability to test the assembled modules allows corrections to be made in the convenience of construction sites in temperate climates with easy access to parts and equipment, rather than at remote Antarctic locations where shipping in of replacement parts is an arduous undertaking..Using the tail code BH, they are the only squadron currently supporting the S-3B Viking platform, as well as flying Lockheed P-3 Orion and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, in support of the United States Navy's Sea Test Range, off the shores of central California..It was discovered on 4 January 2000, by astronomers of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research program conducted at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States..This Is Not a Test is a novel written by Canadian author Courtney Summers..

The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better."
"The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing.. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again."
 The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself.. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself.
"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart.

If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her."
"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable.The site was slated to begin operation in the fall of 2009, however, Simcoe County Council voted in September 2009 to shelve the project after a massive public protest..Sansonetti set the fastest time in the amateur Goulburn to Sydney Classic in 1979 run from Goulburn to Liverpool..Atif Rauf (born March 3, 1964 in Lahore, Punjab) is a former Pakistani cricketer who played in one Test against New Zealand in 1994..The AEB, along with other Afrikaner parties, was merging into the Freedom Front Plus to contest the 2004 elections but the National Action, claiming to support Afrikaner interests, remained separate, and competed in the 2004 elections.. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph."
 The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it.Justin Cronin won his uncontested seat for an additional term in 2016..Metal testing is a process or procedure used to check composition of an unknown metallic substance..Scientific archeologists tested his claims which revealed to be extreme accurated..PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Policy) requires institutions to establish and maintain proper measures to ensure the appropriate care and use of live vertebrate animals involved in biomedical and behavioral research testing or training activities conducted or supported by the PHS.. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.
 She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it..
 They author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want to see what people would say..
"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test.Out of the 73 contestants listed, 19 of them were under the age of 20, including two winners and two runners-up..Street Smarts was a United States game show that featured two in-studio contestants trying to predict the outcome of interviews of people who were found on the street..C-170/84 is an EU labor law case, that sets out the test for objective justification for indirect discrimination..Such Bibles comprise 39 books of the Old Testament (according to the Jewish Hebrew Bible canon, known especially to non-Protestants as the protocanonical books) and the 27 books of the New Testament for a total of 66 books.. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way."
"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind.A gastrinoma is a tumor in the pancreas or duodenum that secretes excess of gastrin leading to ulceration in the duodenum, stomach and the small intestine..Testudomyces is a fungal genus in the family Onygenaceae..Article Six of the United States Constitution establishes the laws and treaties of the United States made in accordance with it as the supreme law of the land, forbids a religious test as a requirement for holding a governmental position and holds the United States under the Constitution responsible for debts incurred by the United States under the Articles of Confederation..Besides Hobbs and Sutcliffe, the team included future Indian Test players C. K. Nayudu and Syed Mushtaq Ali.. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved"
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope.Computer graphics artists often visit alt.binaries.slack to show off their latest experimental works, along with underground musicians who want to expose their music to a ""unique"" audience..The winner of the contest was Mariam Mamadashvili, who represented Georgia with the song ""Mzeo"", marking the third time Georgia has won the Junior Eurovision Song Contest (following 2008 and 2011 respectively), making Georgia the first country to win the competition three times..In 2006, the 1987 version was ranked number 17 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s..This could only be achieved by crushing the power of the Zulu King, Dingane, at the greatest battle ever fought in South Africa, namely the Battle of Blood River, which took place on Sunday 16 December 1838.""In the sequel to the Battle of Blood River in January 1840, Prince Mpande finally defeated King Dingane in the Battle of Maqongqe and was subsequently crowned as new king of the Zulu by his alliance partner Andries Pretorius.. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."
"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her.Only One Road was included later on The Collector's Series, Volume One compilation in 2000 and My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection greatest hits (European edition) in 2008..For example, synchronous bitstreams are carried by SONET, and Transmission Control Protocol transports an asynchronous bytestream..The Letter of Jeremiah, also known as the Epistle of Jeremiah, is a deuterocanonical book of the Old Testament; this letter purports to have been written by Jeremiah to the Jews who were about to be carried away as captives to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar..Australia also finished in the top ten in two of its other appearances in the contest, with Guy Sebastian finishing fifth in 2015, and Isaiah Firebrace finishing ninth in 2017.. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  "
"The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she’ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.."

 She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring.. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it.
" The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow.

 The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow.. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.
"All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story.

But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she’ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness.Middlesex have played home matches at fourteen grounds, but have played the majority of their home fixtures at Lord's, which also holds Test, One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket matches..The KABC also gives special attention to certain emerging testing needs, such as use with handicapped groups, application to problems of learning disabilities, and appropriateness for cultural and linguistic minorities..The season 1 finale was on March 5, 2016 and the winning contestant was Lynn Al-Hayek from Lebanon from Team Kadhem Al-Saher..It is primarily expressed in the testes..

 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again.. The author is showing that the character doesn’t like this test. And would rather not take it
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she.However, the launch was tarnished by the news that Virgin Media had also dropped popular channels such as Dave, Drama, Home, Really and Yesterday, leading to protest from customers who were unhappy at the changes..While the rising moving average indicator is commonly used by investors without realizing, there has been significant backtesting on historic stock data to calculate the performance of the rising moving average..Every player to captain the South Africa national rugby union team (Springboks) in a test match is listed here..Tyrone Brown (born 1973) is an African-American man from Texas who, in 1990, was sentenced to a life term in a Texas maximum security prison and was kept incarcerated for 17 years after testing positive once for smoking marijuana while on probation for robbing a man of two dollars at the age of 17.. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test."
"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up.Ex Chief Minister of Punjab Parkash Singh Badal has record five consecutive wins from 1997 to 2017 contesting from Lambi Assembly Constituency..Most privately owned shortwave stations have been religious broadcasters, either wholly owned and programmed by Roman Catholic and evangelical Protestant charities or offering brokered programming consisting primarily of religious broadcasters..While some tests indicate its strength lies somewhere between the weaker Bowline and stronger figure-of-eight loop, the trident loop shows exceptional resistance to slipping in shock-loading tests..The Lahore Declaration signaled a major breakthrough in overcoming the historically strained bilateral relations between the two nations in the aftermath of the publicly performed atomic tests carried out by both nations in May 1998.. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things"
"Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country.

The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother"

"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home.The National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) is a premier analytical testing & research organization established as an autonomous body under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India..Inputs to develop a charter can be: Project Statement of Work Business Case Agreements Enterprise standards, industry standards, regulations and norms Organizational process, assets and templatesTypically a project manager takes the lead in developing the charter..The Force Concept Inventory is a test measuring mastery of concepts commonly taught in a first semester of physics developed by Hestenes, Halloun, Wells, and Swackhamer (1985)..Intended as a small prototype craft that would precede the development of much larger hybrid airships, the AEREON III was constructed between 1959 and 1965 but was destroyed during taxiing tests in 1966 and scrapped without having flown.. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."
 The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job..
 The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back.Teknia has been the fastest growing Technology Park in Finland for the new millennium..He changed his name from Suman Chattopadhay to Kabir Suman when he converted to Islam as a mark of protest against the killing of christian missionary Graham Staines by Hindu fundamentalist group Bajrang Dal..Jurists have remarked that Chief Justice John Marshall's six-word opinion is one of the shortest Supreme Court cases ever written..Billboard named the song #67 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.
"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again.Construction on large scale has turned Dubai into one of the fastest-growing cities in the world..Guy was ranked 30th in Rolling Stone magazine's ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time""..This list contains only multiple births which have some claim to notability, such as being the first recorded in a country, the first to survive to adulthood in a country, or the heaviest, lightest or longest lived (globally)..He replaced Wayne Smith, who resigned to protest changes in Statistics Canada's informatics infrastructure stemming from the Shared Services Canada initiative.. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."
 the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope.. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.
"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story.Phoronix Test Suite (PTS) is a free, open-source benchmark software for Linux and other operating systems which is developed by Phoronix Media with cooperation from an undisclosed number of hardware and software vendors..The album became McBride's fastest-selling of her career and gave her her best debut sales week with 185,000 copies sold in its first week..Uncial 0314 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament..He is recognized worldwide as one of the greatest living magicians.. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."
" The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved.South African batsman Jacques Rudolph became the first man to score a Test century at MA Aziz Stadium when he made unbeaten 222 against Bangladesh in 2003..SEARCC also runs the annual International Schools' Software Competition, a teams programming competition, normally contested by winning teams from the country's national programming competitions..Iain William Provan (born 6 May 1957) is a British Old Testament scholar, now living in Canada..The Emergency Dam was put to the ultimate test on June 9, 1909 when the freighter Perry G. Walker crashed into the upstream lock sending a torrent of water crashing into the downstream lock.. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It’s explaining moments in time.It is a late composition, written in 1930, the result of an invitation to write a test piece for the National Brass Band Championship..San Marino participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018..This area of slippage both horizontally and vertically is called the epicenter, and has the highest magnitude, and causes the greatest damage..The test is conducted in offline mode..

"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .Between 2001 and 2007, the contest was telecast 'live' by the local television station Mediacorp's Channel 5..A key part of MCERTS is accrediting monitoring equipment, loggers and software used in environmental monitoring applications, although they may be invalidated if not used in line with the exact processes used when tested..Yakovlev's lawyer, Arkady Bukh, has stated that he expects Mr. Yakovlev's sentence to be significantly reduced in exchange for Yakovlev's testimony at trial..Kirkaldy Testing Museum is a museum in Southwark, south London, England, in David Kirkaldy's former testing works..” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it."
"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her.Comparative testing subjects several replicate samples of similar products to identical test conditions..Face validity is the extent to which a test is subjectively viewed as covering the concept it purports to measure..For a period it was contested over 1,800 meters..The Greatest Wonder of the World and American Tobacco Warehouse and Fancy Goods Emporium are heritage-listed adjacent shops at 123-125 Mayne Street, Gulgong, Mid-Western Regional Council, New South Wales, Australia.. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test.Greatest Hits/The Deluxe Edition is a greatest hits album by American hard rock vocalist David Lee Roth, compiling his solo work from 1985 to 1994..MTV's The Cut, was the first in a line televised song contest that was later followed by American Idol..They started as dance contests in the 1920s and developed into entertainment events during the Great Depression in the 1930s..Hottest Night of the Year is a studio album by Canadian country music artist Anne Murray.. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time.Family members may be tested to see if they are susceptible by muscle biopsy or genetic testing..The 2018 Kaveri River water dispute is a series of ongoing protests on the issue of water sharing problems from the River Kaveri between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka which are the two main states of India..Whitestone Point Light is located in Whitestone, Queens..The population was 2,985 at the 2010 census, up from 2,167 at the 2000 census, the greatest increase in population in Sullivan County over this time period.. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."
"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.It is classified on the list of Coptic manuscripts of the New Testament on the position sa 181..Kvyat, who set the second fastest time in qualifying, dominated in both races and left Monza with 53 of 54 possible points..The Missouri Gaming Commission is a state agency that regulates riverboat casinos, charitable bingo,and fantasy sports contests in Missouri..Thus Kirsten had proved that the testatrix was unduly influenced and accordingly lacked the requisite capacity..- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."
"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up.It was the first full tour to Kenya by a Test playing country..The Court gave a two-part test to determine whether a proceeding deals with a criminal matter..Boats, Beaches, Bars & Ballads is a four-compact disk (or cassette) compilation box set of Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band's greatest hits, rarities, and previously unreleased songs..ASTM F 1643 is a Standard Test Methods for Detention Sliding Door Locking Device Assembly.. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test.The parts are usually test fitted, then sanded and painted to represent the intended finish or look..However, the party refused to stand any candidates in the region, and in 2016 Holmes was part of a group which founded the Northern Ireland Labor Representation Committee, a parallel group with the primary purpose of contesting elections, becoming its nominating officer..Chelonibia testudinaria is a species of barnacle in the family Chelonibiidae..Bushfield was a contestant on the reality diving competition Splash beginning in March 2013.. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "
"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise.The song ""Deadbeat Protest"" was named one of the best songs of the year by Pitchfork and Noisey..This pageant is unrelated to Miss Barbados World and Miss Barbados International contest..Nationally normed standardized test scores range from the 80s to the 90s, on average..Judo was contested at the 2017 Summer Universiade from August 20 to 24 at the Hsinchu County Gymansium in Zhubei, Hsinchu County, Taiwan.. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started.. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself.

When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too."

Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending."

It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think."

 The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again.. 
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again. “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.Featherweight was the second lightest category, and included wrestlers weighing up to 67.5 kilograms..The contestants themselves voted 2-1 to continue with the competition..They have released a number of albums, and in 2012 won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and International Songwriting Contest for lyrics on their EP Filthy Hippie Music..This was a timed-final event, meaning that each entrant only swam it once, with the fastest 8 entrants swimming in the finals session and the remainder swimming in the preliminary session..” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  "
"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again.

THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY."
 I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story..The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her.Bedrock Development, Inc. was named the sixth fastest-growing company in the San Francisco Bay Area by the SF Business Times, and BizGym Foundations and Lemonade Alley won Steve an award for Hawaii-based charities from BBB Hawaii..The origins of the term are hotly contested, and there are many theories as to where the term derives from, but there is very little in the way of hard facts..Albert de Silva defeated the former Prime Minister Dr. Wijayananda Dahanayake at the 1977 general election, contesting for the Galle seat..The latest, Yarrow, was released on October 27, 2017.. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test."
" The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past .Starting the next edition of the tournament, eight countries will contest the final tournament with the host changing every edition..She is also referred to in the deuterocanonical books at Wisdom 10:7 and the New Testament at Luke 17:32..Two years later, following fan protest, it was announced on July 22, 2017 that Season 18 would be released on December 5, 2017 on DVD with the possibility of further seasons if sales are strong enough..His only other test appearance was during the 1920 Great Britain Lions tour, when he played in the third Ashes test.. When she  isn’t  home she said “ I failed the test .” This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn’t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal."

Saeng failed to fine the fine–toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding."

By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality."
" I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home.The event is organized by the sport's governing body, the Federation of International Polo (FIP), and is contested by the national teams..The album compiled most singles released by Newton-John since the release of her 1977 Olivia Newton-John's Greatest Hits album from her following albums and soundtracks..The males have internal testicles, which are located between the bladder and the rectum..It is a relatively new party, was among the latest new parties registration approved by the Registrar of Society (RoS) and just received permission to operate as a political party in 2013.. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  "
"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her.Plugtests can be formal and have public test scores or informal and private..In 2009, when she was only 10 years old, she became a contestant in noontime show Eat Bulaga's Birit Baby, and was declared first runner-up..Many factors describe what drove the design flow from a set of separate design steps to a fully integrated approach, and what further changes are coming to address the latest challenges..Discovered by NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, the galaxy is the record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe, with brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate..

After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages"

Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story."
"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end.She has since released four more studio albums and a greatest hits compilation, and participated in another production of Starmania in 2000, this time in the role of Sadia..The races are contested with LMP3 cars and Group CN cars..The 1911 Grizzlies were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time..Another notable personality is former Australian Idol contestant Stu Campbell, who formerly hosted the night show but now is part of the commercial creative copy writing department..

 Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them..
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome.Greg Thomas (born John Gregory Thomas, 12 August 1960 in Trebanos, Glamorgan, Wales) is a Welsh former cricketer, who played in five Tests and three ODIs for England between 1986 and 1987..15th Celebration (stylized as Super Best Records -15th Celebration-) is the second greatest hits album by Japanese singer Misia..The feminist protest, organized by New York Radical Women, included tossing a collection of symbolic feminine products, pots, false eyelashes, mops, and other items into a ""Freedom trash can"" on the Atlantic City boardwalk..The ecumenical Committee on Bible Translation is composed of 47 American and English scholars from the three major branches of Christendom: Orthodox, Protestant, and Roman Catholic.. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again."
 The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng.. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding.Issues involving genetic testing also invariably lead to ethical and legal concerns, such as the potential for inadvertent effects on family members, increased insurance rates, or increased psychological stress..The party contested the Indian general election, 1977 with the Janata alliance and later merged with it..Sani also commented on the controversy surrounding the November 2016 Jakarta protests, questioning why police had financially investigated some of the protests' backers but not the financial backers of Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama..The protests blocked a road to the mine and cut off electricity.. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."
"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then.In a testimony before the United States Senate regarding Internet Gaming, Grant Eve, a Certified Public Accountant representing the US Accounting Firm Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants, estimated that one in every four dollars gambled is gambled online..Proponents of estimation see reporting a p-value as an unhelpful distraction from the important business of reporting an effect size with its confidence intervals, and believe that estimation should replace significance testing for data analysis..However, it ended up being included on almost every one of his greatest hits albums.[not in citation given]Although Newman had never charted a single before, and his previous album, Good Old Boys, had been his third to reach the Billboard 200, ""Short People"" soon gained attention as a novelty song..The match was contested by AS de Vacoas-Phoenix and Pointe aux Sables Mates.. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things."
"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity.Comprising a cycle of linked stories set in Dorset, England, it depicts a 20th century in which the Roman Catholic Church still has supremacy; in its timeline, Protestantism was destroyed during wars that resulted from the aftermath of the assassination of Queen Elizabeth in 1588..As land conversion (from a natural state to human use) is one of the greatest threats to the natural environment in general, and biodiversity in particular, this is seen as good for the environment..The August 1994 uprising or Maleconazo uprising was a protest against government policies in Cuba..Her full name was revealed in the 2015 film The Peanuts Movie as 'Frieda Rich', where she places 12th in the test results.. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.."
 The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now..
"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring.DeVoe Brand (born May 9, 1931) is an American former naval officer and aviator, aeronautical engineer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut..Buist Martin Fanning, III (born May 26, 1949) is an American scholar of biblical Greek and professor of New Testament studies at Dallas Theological Seminary..He developed the Holtzman Inkblot Test..In medical tests, including rapid diagnostic tests, cross-reactivity can be either confounding or helpful, depending on the instance.. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."
" It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it.In countries covered by International Financial Reporting Standards, the tests are defined in IAS 17..In most recent years the vessels are used in deepwater and ultra-deepwater applications, equipped with the latest and most advanced dynamic positioning systems..The event is organized by the sport's governing body, the Federation of International Polo (FIP), and is contested by the national teams..Several countries withdrew their ambassadors to Denmark, and widespread protests, some of them violent, began.. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story"
"I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again.Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States established the ""total takings"" test for evaluating whether a particular regulatory action constitutes a regulatory taking that requires compensation..Ellerby's 2007 piece Elgar Variations, honoring British composer Sir Edward Elgar, was used as the test piece for the Championship section of the 2013 North American Brass Band Association competition..The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals provides a public database for those dogs that are DNA tested..The website provides the latest news and reviews of the latest programs and films for TV and Cinema.. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1)."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to.Completed in 1969, it was upgraded with high-order adaptive optics in 2004 and remains a highly versatile astrophysical observatory which serves as an important test platform for developing new instrumentation and technologies..The CPU additionally contained instructions, operator communication, bootstrap loaders, and hardware test programs, that were implemented in a 1K read-only memory..This service for families got Approved Parental Control Product award from AV Comparatives, a European test lab of online safety and anti-virus solutions..Versions of the test are available from a number of sources, including a stand-alone test by William Culbertson and Eric Zillmer (published by Drexel University) and a child/adolescent version that is part of the original NEPSY neuropsychological battery of tests by Marit Korkman, Ursula Kirk, and Sally Kemp (although removed from the second edition).. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country.The Iraqi protester was killed in that same incident..Slovenia has participated in the Eurovision Young Musicians 12 times since its debut in 1994, winning the contest for the first time in 2010..After a ruling in Weinberg's favor, the ""Tenafly Five"" ballots were opened by Judge Peter Doyne on October 5, 2005, and each ballot was cast for Weinberg, thus giving her the slim margin of victory; With these five votes now counted, Weinberg defeated Zisa by one vote in balloting to fill Baer's vacated seat on an interim basis, 115-114, and won the contest for the Democratic ballot spot in November by a total of 116-112..The experiment would have tested one aspect of transpermia, the hypothesis that life could survive space travel, if protected inside rocks blasted by impact off one planet to land on another.. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower.Music written to be played only on the manuals (instead of using the pedals) can be designated by manualiter (first attested in 1511, but particularly common in the 17th and 18th centuries)..Before the series, the New Zealand team had played a three-Test series in Pakistan..Similar to the American series HGTV Design Star, the show features aspiring interior designers competing in a series of challenges, following which one contestant is named the ""design superstar"" at the end of the competition..That perception, which may or may not be accurate, depends entirely on the purpose for the test.. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring.Under HOPE, probationers receive drug treatment only if they continue to test positive for drug use or if they request a treatment referral..Japan operates a number of centers for supercomputing which hold world records in speed, with the K computer becoming the world's fastest in June 2011.The K computer's performance is impressive, according to professor Jack Dongarra who maintains the TOP500 list of supercomputers, and it surpasses its next 5 competitors combined..Academy Music Studio is a professional recording studio located in Dewsbury, England which utilizes the latest digital recording technology and also traditional analog equipment if required..MBBS and B.Tech courses have been removed from OJEE after the announcement of All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT) and JEE (Main).. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."
"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store.In Europe, the Protestant Reformation gave a major blow to the authority of the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church..The latest 38th edition was published in year 2016..The exterior, the large antique loom (1830) and the interior, are testimony of the once flourishing textile industry (and trade) around Leiden, in particular during the 16th and 17th century, when many home weavers supplied the draper's guild with high quality woolen cloth..The tournament was contested between Scotland, Ireland and Wales.. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."
 I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold.. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on
"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again.Mark 1 is the first chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible..The seat was previously held by Liberal Louise Markus, who contested the more marginal seat of Macquarie at the 2010 federal election..It commenced 1 February 2011, ending 31 August 2011, becoming one of the longest-running student occupations in the context of the wider movement of student protests in the UK in 2010, early 2011, and 2011 United Kingdom anti-austerity protests..She returned in 2009 for a special appearance to start off the Winter season, where she testified against the thugs and separated from Callum.. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle."
 I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back..
"The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on.In 1931, the Universalist congregation in Table Grove merged with the congregations of the Disciples of Christ and the Presbyterians to form a single Protestant church; the Illinois Universalist Congregation gave the new church the Universalists' building..The Pixel Bender Toolkit was bundled with Adobe's Creative Suite, and allowed programs to be created and tested..The West Indies won the first three Tests quite easily against a very weak Australian team..During the World Bank Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics in Oslo, Norway in 2002 large globalization-critical protests were held.. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ .IGN has named him the 75th greatest game creator of all time [1]..Paco Testas is a fictional character in DC Comics..The Dutch Tweede Divisie in the 1966/1967 season was contested by 23 teams..Valentina Monetta who failed to qualify in two previous contest, represented San Marino with the song ""Maybe"", which qualified from the first semi-final....and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."
"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet.Orally administered dirithromycin is absorbed rapidly into the plasma, largely from the small intestine..In addition to having published more than 260 research papers, Saltiel holds 16 patents and has extensive experience with the FDA's testing and approval process for new drugs..Congregationalism, as defined by the Pew Research Center, is estimated to represent 0.5% of the worldwide Protestant population; though their polity-related customs and other ideas influenced significant parts of Protestantism, as well as other Christian congregations..Australian alternative music radio station Triple J ranked the song the 32nd greatest of 1994.. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."
" When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time.Arctesthes siris is a moth of the Geometridae family..The 2014 AFL season was the 118th season in the Australian Football League contested by the Sydney Swans..Miratesta is a genus of freshwater air-breathing snails, aquatic pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Planorbidae, the ram's horn snails, or planorbids..She was one of the contestants in the first season of Bigg Boss Telugu and hosted by N.T. Rama Rao Jr.. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants."
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is about this girl named Saeng and her mother and grandmother.

Cobra) from Gladiators and actor Kevin Lloyd from The Bill who died in 1998 whilst both shows were still running.. Picking them, @CAPS1 them. “Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye”    "
 The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story..
 The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year..
"The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home.It was previously the Eastern Bloc equivalent to the Eurovision Song Contest..After the show never made it to air, Young and 6 other contestants sued the producers, claiming they were never paid..This is, to date, the latest studio album (but not the latest non-phostumous) to be released by Area..Both the UK and US versions featured celebrity contestants.. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring."
"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost.Historical languages (also known as historic languages) are languages that were spoken in a historical period, but that are distinct from their modern form; that is, they are forms of languages historically attested to from the past which have evolved into more modern forms..Prior consistent statements and prior inconsistent statements, in the law of evidence, occur where a witness, testifying at trial, makes a statement that is either consistent or inconsistent, respectively, with a previous statement given at an earlier time such as during a discovery, interview, or interrogation..Critically speaking, he is held in high regard as a songwriter, being named one of the 100 greatest living songwriters by Paste Magazine..Typical open campaigns rely on organizing talks, video displays, mailings, protest letters, leaflets distributions, articles in newspapers, petitions.. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown.Flight tests showed it to be severely underpowered, making it useless as a combat aircraft..1915 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Collingwood Football Club and Carlton Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 18 September 1915..The Greatest Hits and reached number six on the UK Singles Chart..Christianism means the religious systems, tenets, or practices of Christians, in various forms of religious practices of denominations, such as Catholicism, Protestantism, Mormonism, etc.. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home."
 Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them.. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said “yes| when she planted the hibiscus.
"She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding.. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring."
. Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end
".I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens"
"The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now.Occupy Canada was a collective of peaceful protests and demonstrations that were part of the larger Occupy Together movement which first manifested in the financial district of New York City with Occupy Wall Street, and subsequently spread to over 900 cities around the world..The individual championship test, grade Ib, para-equestrian dressage event at the 2016 Summer Paralympics was contested on 2 September in Rio de Janeiro..A game show host is an individual who manages a game show, introduces contestants, and asks quiz questions to test the knowledge of said contestants..His teacher and principal quality work was instrumental to DCPS achieving unprecedented gains in student learning, student and staff satisfaction, graduation rates, and enrollment, prompting former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to highlight DC Public Schools as one of the fastest improving urban districts in the nation.. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today."
"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one.And Polyols"".FODMAPs are short chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine..In 2014 CATBird software test station was upgraded by Northrop Grumman with Tech Refresh 2 hardware which gives the CATBird capability to test F-35 Block 3 Software..Towards the end of the series run it aired at 1:00PM, aired against Summer Science School on HSV-7 and a test pattern on ABV-2..Elena Juatco (a season 2 contestant) assumed the role for season four, Dave Kerr had the role in season five and Jully Black in season six.. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. "
 In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again.. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.
"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test.It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec..These anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic protests culminated into riots in Philadelphia in 1844, St. Louis in 1854, Cincinnati and Louisville in 1855, Baltimore in 1856, Washington, D.C. and New York in 1857, and New Orleans in 1858..The Presbyterian Church, for instance, is one of the few Protestant denominations that still requires all ministers to have a working knowledge of both Biblical Greek and Hebrew..Unlike Paradise Hotel, the contestants could live in a resort not for weeks or months, but for years.. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome."
" In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed.He then scored his first Test try against South Africa on 14 July 2007..This nematode is widely used as a gastrointestinal parasitic model in immunological, pharmacological and toxicological studies..Based on its state test results, it has received a GreatSchools Rating of 4 out of 10..NGC 1272 has an active nucleus and is the second brightest member of the Perseus Cluster after NGC 1275.. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment."
"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay.Republicans did not seriously contest this election given the strong Democratic tilt of the district, which has not elected a Republican to the United States House of Representatives since Reconstruction nor been represented by a moderate to conservative Representative since 1992 when Walter B.

The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   "
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring.. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting."
 She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle.. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.
 So she saying she will take the test next year..

Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject."
"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test.

"The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude.

By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again.The greatest potential for injury while rock climbing occurs when a lead climber falls..The club, which can trace its history back to 1905, achieved its greatest successes in handball, volleyball, table tennis and football..The golden-fronted whitestart (Myioborus ornatus), or, less accurately, the golden-fronted redstart, is a species of bird in the Parulidae family..In 2006, Douglas won the title and began working with the squad for HSV dealer team in V8 Supercars and testing their Commodore in the second half of the season.. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "
"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around.The single received high rotation on Triple J and placed at #24 in their Hottest 100 of 2010..When an ATPG tool generates a test for a fault, or a set of faults, only a small percentage of scan cells need to take specific values..These efforts are premised on the premise that breaking away from conventional calendars and schedules by expanding the length and quality of the school day in high-performing, high-poverty schools has the potential to improve academic achievement, broaden curriculum (including time for non-tested subjects such as science, social studies, music, art, and physical education), and empower teachers by giving them more time to collaborate..The mixed pairs BC3 boccia event at the 2016 Summer Paralympics was contested from 10 September to 13 September at Sambodromo in Rio de Janeiro.. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."
 I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts..
"When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus.. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased"
"The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home.For most of the 1960s, Seymour Cray worked at CDC and developed a series of machines that were the fastest computers in the world by far, until Cray left the company to found Cray Research (CRI) in the 1970s..Masso's greatest result in singles was reaching the final of Hilversum in 1990 as a qualifier, beating celebrated claycourters Juan Aguilera, Sergi Bruguera and Emilio Sanchez en route..At the time, the government and the mainstream media in Mexico claimed that government forces had been provoked by protesters shooting at them..Baur participated as a jury member at the START Summiteer, a start-up pitching contest of the University of St Gallen.. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom."
. because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place
 The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time.. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.
 She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done.. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about
 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time.. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.
" The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life.Soil test may refer to one or more of a wide variety of soil analyzes conducted for one of several possible reasons..The Baptist Church in Kyrgyzstan is one of the oldest and most widespread Protestant Christian denominations in the country..As with other games in the series, there are by default five objectives the player can pursue in order to finish the game: conquering all other civilizations, controlling a supermajority of the game world's land and population, building and sending the first sleeper ship to the Alpha Centauri star system, increasing the ""Culture ratings"" of at least three different cities to ""legendary"" levels, or winning a ""World Leader"" popularity contest by the United Nations..With the expansion of European colonialism from the Early Modern era, the Latin Church, in time along with its Protestant secessions, spread throughout the Americas, much of the Philippines, Southern Africa, pockets of West Africa, and throughout Australia, and New Zealand..

"the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring.."
The author chose to conclude the story like that because sheâ€™s saying that it isnâ€™t over and sheâ€™s going to take the test again.. In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.
. I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up
"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country.It is their shortest release so far..Latest information on Copacabana can be found on the official Copacabana Community Website..Hargrave was selected as the Saskatchewan Party candidate in a heavily contested nomination meeting, which was conducted in the Prince Albert Exhibition Center..The result was a victory for the Mauritanian Regroupment Party, which was the only party to contest the elections, thereby winning all 40 seats in the National Assembly.. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again."
"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable.

So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did."
 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again..
"When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year. She means trying to plant the plants all over again.The song ""Don't Look At Me"" was featured on WOW #1s: 31 of the Greatest Christian Music Hits Ever..It names asteroids discovered under the LINEAR project after teachers and contesting students who performed outstandingly in the following Society for Science and the Public competitions: the Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge, the Intel Science Talent Search, the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair..The album was re-released in 2017 under the title The Greatest Hits by Liberation Music..The greatest achievement of the village was being the center of telegraphic communication between the capital Quito and the port city of Guayaquil for nearly 30 years.. When Saeng says “Here, let me help, mother. Right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all."
"The author conclude the story with the paragraph ""when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.. She realize she has another chance to pass the test, when the spring blossoms again she begin to garden when the spring returns."
"The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again..” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again."
"“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows.PA-1 was the first test in a sequence of atmospheric flight tests known as Orion Abort Flight Test (AFT)..The phrase ""Conradson carbon residue"" and its common names can refer to either the test or the numerical value obtained from it..The testudinatum was employed when the hall was small and another floor was built over it; no example of this type has been found at Pompeii, and only one of the cavaedium displuviatum..Due to an advanced lighting system installed in 1925, it was once called ""the brightest street in the world."". Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them."
"I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year.For example, assays exist for rubella virus, rotavirus, and rheumatoid factor, and an excellent LA test is available for cryptococcus..When Jerry asks Beth to choose between him and Rick, the strength of their marriage is tested..The championships was contested between Europe's eight top national teams and was held at the Conlog Arena in Koblenz, Germany..He wrote the lyrics and composed the music for the French entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 (performed by Isabelle Aubret).. Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment.As a cancer physician he is best known for his contribution to the treatment of testicular cancer..In 2003, it ranked 50th in CMT's 100 Greatest Songs of Country Music..The Eurovision Song Contest 1987 was the 32nd Eurovision Song Contest and was held on 9 May 1987 in Brussels, Belgium after Sandra Kim's win the previous year..In 2010, CAAS was selected among more than 700 contestants as one of only six suppliers honored with Chery's ""2010 Annual Best Parts Supplier."". @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels."
"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying.Witness 11 is a 2012 short dramatic film based on the testimony of renowned German poet and playwright, Bertolt Brecht, during the height of the 1940s Red Scare..It was used on the Italian three-phase test line from Rome-Sulmona especially in express train service..He also played in one Test match in 2004..In November 2010, there were violent protests against a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste..

The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter."

"I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending.. also so you know that the story is that they could make more."
"Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding.

 The Author concludes the with paragraph because she wont to..
"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion.

The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."
 The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese..
 She wrote that response to tell everyone   that  she  will  be ready  but the time when spring  comes..    Then   she  take it and pass.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won’t stop until they are in the south for winter.. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal."
"Thes Author, In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories.

"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding.

"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “..The Protestant Reformation during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach..XP-4 was a prototype United States biplane fighter of the 1920s that was grounded permanently after just 4.5 hours of flight testing..TTUISD offers individual courses (supplemental), credit by exams (CBEs), homeschool curriculum, bulk testing services, and a full-time Texas Diploma Program that includes high school, middle school and elementary school..Encouraged once more by a resurgent interest from its fans, the band decided in 1999 to do a ""re-recording"" of old hits from the past albums and compile those into a rehashed greatest hits package.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  "
"The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn’t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it.. The author is showing Saeng’s determination to pass the test and do better next time."

 I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test.. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.
 The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight you’ll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people..

"The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that “never giving up is important” is presented and carried out hopefully through the character’s vow.S.A.G.A.P.O. was the Greek entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002, performed in English by Michalis Rakintzis..ARS is of greatest value in a liberalized or deregulated telecom environment where there are multiple competing carriers and rate plans available..Testing programs range from simple tests with little replication to more thorough experimental designs..The Network Test Automation Forum (NTAF), founded in 2010, is a nonprofit international industry alliance, dedicated to promoting interoperability of commercial network testing tools and testing infrastructure, by defining and facilitating adoption of technical specifications..

In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard."

The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test.

" The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad.

To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions."
 At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work.. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again.."
"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons.

"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs.According to data collection and environment assessment studies of World Bank experts, between 1995 through 2010, India has made some of the fastest progress in addressing its environmental issues and improving its environmental quality in the world..The Act extended to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (despite the protests of the Governments there)..Indiani Metropolitani (Metropolitan Indians) were a small faction active in the Italian far-left protest movement during 1976 and 1977, in the so-called ""Years of Lead""..It was for FIA Class 1 Touring Cars and it was contested by Mercedes-Benz, Alfa Romeo and Opel.. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying.The Deseret Test Center was a U.S. Army operated command in charge of testing chemical and biological weapons during the 1960s..She failed an out-of-competition doping test in July 2016 and was given a four-year ban started from 17 August that year and had her Olympic performance annulled..He won the contested election at Carlisle despite being abroad in France, attempting to persuade the Earl's brother William to return to England..In 2008, it was included on the North American version of My Love: Essential Collection greatest hits compilation.. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes."
 I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack..
"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that.For more information on testosterone as a medication, see the testosterone (medication) article..Following her win at the international pageant held in Tokyo, Japan, she toured the globe for a year, ending up back in Japan, in Osaka to crown the winner of the Miss International contest in 1970, Aurora McKenny Pijuan..Kingsmead has hosted 40 Test matches, the first was in 1923 when South Africa played the touring England team..Once per month, this weekly service is a fast and testimony meeting.. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things."
 The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she’s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here.. She’s said  and does lots of fun things.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home.The necessity of a game seven cannot be known until the outcome of game six is determined, assuming that a series reaches the sixth contest..He has testified before Congress, and is a regular media commentator on national security and American politics on broadcast, print and digital media..The India cricket team toured New Zealand, playing a five-match One Day International series and two Test matches against the New Zealand national team from 19 January to 18 February 2014..The race was the title-decider in a three-way contest between Aston Martin, Ferrari and Porsche.. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace."
"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother.It is remarkable in that it was the first and only song that was sung at the end of concerts between ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We Are the Champions"" since the News of the World Tour in 1977.The song was included in various greatest hits compilations by Queen such as Greatest Hits II, Greatest Flix II and Greatest Video Hits II..He was the chairman of the National Committee for Civil Defense until he was dismissed by Sultan Qaboos during 2011 Omani protests..Belt wrestling was contested at the 2013 Summer Universiade from July 6 to 9 at the Ak Bars Wrestling Palace in Kazan, Russia..The 2004 Olympic champion, Justin Gatlin, was a prominent athlete to fail a doping test at the Kansas Relays.. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.Typically the author will create slides in PowerPoint, record narration on top of the slides, and then use software to add tests, or even collaboration activities between the slides..Over 1,600 test launches were conducted before the catapult was removed in 1952 and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier to transport aircraft, troops and equipment overseas..Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling..Other supporting tests include a hydrogen breath test and a stool acidity test..” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test.In a race umpired by former Oxford rower Joseph William Chitty, Cambridge won by three lengths in a time of 19 minutes and 35 seconds, the fastest time in the history of the event..Deep Zone and their song ""Play"" were disqualified after the song was found to have been unofficially released before the final, breaching the contest's rules and leaving nine to compete in the final..He played 156 Test matches in his career, a record until it was passed by fellow Australian Steve Waugh..Other notable former titleholders include actress, model and sportscaster Jayne Kennedy and two former Survivor contestants, Kim Mullen of Survivor: Palau and Candace Smith of Survivor: Tocantins.. “She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. “This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2."
"  The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined.Anedie Azael (b.

Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up."
"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time.Species are found nearly worldwide but the greatest concentration is in the northern temperate regions..Sulakshana Madhukar Naik (born 10 November 1978 in Mumbai) is a cricketer (wicket-keeper) who has played in 46 women's One Day Internationals, 31 Twenty20 internationals and two Tests for India..Gent per Formentera (English: People for Formentera, GxF), is a political grouping of the island of Formentera that appeared in 2007 to contest the elections to the Island Council of Formentera and the elections to the Parliament of the Balearic Islands (in coalition with PSIB)..He became known to a wider audience as a contestant on the first season of The Voice, reaching Top 4 on Blake Shelton's team..

Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."
" The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again.

That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”.His latest album Wilayah (2012 / produced by Azmyl Yunor & Ron Khoo) was recorded with his touring band the Sigarettes..It is widely reported that the arts are losing instruction time in school based upon budget cuts in combination with increasing test-based assessments of children which the federal government's No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act requires..In 2003, the album was ranked number 25 (24 in 2012) on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time..One third of the council was up for election and the Labor party kept overall control of the council 21 seats were contested in the election, with 18 being won by the Labor Party, 1 by the Liberal Democrats and 2 by the Conservative.. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness.Domestically, the teams greatest achievement was to reach the 2006 German Bowl, where the team lost to the Braunschweig Lions..All-Time Top 100 TV Themes is the ninth volume of the Television's Greatest Hits series of compilation albums by TVT Records..8 Test matches have been played at the ground along with 10 One Day Internationals (ODIs), the first of which was in 2006 when Bangladesh played India..The parallel individuation system has been attested in human adults, non-human animals, such as fish and human infants, although performance of infants is dependent on their age and task.. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1.The founder of NextScribe pioneered CSSD at the Monastery of Christ in the Desert in 1994, and NextScribe continues to conduct research in the field in partnership with both Catholic and Protestant organizations..The series was contested by regular contestants Australia, England and New Zealand, in addition to Wales, who had qualified for their first Four Nations by winning the 2010 European Cup..This is a list of Ghanaian regions by population, ranked according to the latest census, which took place on 26 September 2010..They achieved their greatest success with their third album fr:Royalty in Exile (1990) a gold disk, and album Jumping the Tracks (1991).. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do."
"In the story , “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower.As the chief recipient of lost SLD support, Labor won their highest share of vote since the council's inception in 1973, and their greatest vote and majority on the council since 1980's re-warding..Moate contested the latter seat, but lost to the Labor candidate, Derek Wyatt..This is done by manually generating packets to test network devices and behavior, instead of using existing network traffic..The Greatest ITs was reaired in early November, 2008, although XM did not air the regular ""IT"" that year, allegedly due to issues surrounding XM's merger with rival Sirius Satellite Radio.. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken..Ted van der Parre holds 3 wins, and Ab Wolders and Gerard Du Prie each have 2 wins in the contest..Besides Vijay Madhav, the film also stars other ISS contestants such as Imran, Bitty, Arun Gopan and others..Greatest Hits is a compilation album by American country music group Restless Heart..With three youth Tests before his nineteenth birthday, Weston joined the Durham first team in 1995, where he played for two years.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on."
"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea.In six Tests, Stuart, who is a right-hand batsman, has a batting average of 3.42 average, and as a right-arm, medium-fast bowler, has taken twenty wickets with a 31.39 average..A similar role was filled for Protestants by the Prussian embassy chapel in Rome, where Protestantism was unlawful until 1871..To use this pattern, a class implements a marker interface (also called tagging interface), and methods that interact with instances of that class test for the existence of the interface..Prior to that, Lima was a contestant on the first season of Big Brother.. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did."
"The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”, says her mother.27 contestants arose from the auditions held in each region, in which office manager Nancy Vaziri of Homewood, Illinois won the title of MasterChef 2000.The second season started on April 7, 2001 with a total of 13 half-hour-long episodes as well as 1 hour long special..Fond du Lac Mudhens were the latest name of a minor league baseball team based in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin that played in the Wisconsin State League between 1891 and 1911..The third season of the VH1 reality television series Flavor of Love brings female contestants into the mansion of Flavor Flav to compete for his love..The August 8, 1932 issue of the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote that Jones was considered ""one of the greatest jockeys ever to come out of the west."". Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself “Then i will take the test again.”     "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again.The band is currently signed to ReIgnition Recordings and their latest album, Reclamation Process, was released on as a free album for subscribers of Law Of Inertia, the rock mag product of Cory Killduff..On-sensor auto-focus is free of the adjustment requirements of the indirect focusing system of the DSLR, and the latest MILCs can shoot with phase-detect autofocus at up to 20 frames per second using up to 693 focus points - a number greatly exceeding what is available on any DSLR..Some large companies, such as Alcatel, Cisco, and Nortel, develop ETS systems internally to standardize and accelerate their test engineering activities, while others such as Harris Corporation and Freescale Semiconductor choose commercial off-the-shelf ETS options for advantages that include test data management and report generation..This School District is rated the #1 performing school district in Florida with excellent testing scores and graduation rates.. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years."
"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.It was made up of Protestants from Ulster, who declared their opposition to the rule of the Catholic James II and endorsed the Glorious Revolution..The Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power, was absent, having been boycotting proceedings since January, in protest that the Republic of China and not the People's Republic of China held a permanent seat on the council..Rehberg was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate in 1996 and 2012, losing to Max Baucus 50% to 45% and to Jon Tester 49% to 45%, respectively..Contests held during the event are extremely varied, and can range from creating the longest Wi-Fi connection (aircrack-ng) to finding the most effective way to cool a beer in the Nevada heat..” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful."

They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again.Hatching of the T. serialis usually occurs only if the eggs have been exposed to gastric secretions proceeded by intestinal secretions..Christianity, especially in its Protestant forms, predominates..Headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USADA is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code, which harmonizes anti-doping practices around the world and is widely considered the basis for the strongest and strictest anti-doping programs in sports..The series, hosted by Steve Santagati, featured twelve contestants competing for a grand prize of $250,000 and a stable of eight thoroughbred horses.. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants."
"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed.In Australia, the song was ranked #31 on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2004..In 2004, they ranked him number 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time..After conclusion of the Apollo program, four CSM's were launched on Saturn IBs for three Skylab Earth orbital missions and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project..MPs shown in italics are not contesting the 2007 election.. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that’s how the girl feel.Though now defunct, the magazine persists in a virtual form via its website, where a pdf file of the latest edition is available to download..UK music magazine Terrorizer ranked Morbid Angel's 1989 debut Altars of Madness first in its list ""Top 40 greatest death metal albums""..The Democratic primary election was heavily contested, and no Republicans or third party candidates sought the seat..Lissotesta decipiens is a species of minute sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc, unassigned in the superfamily Seguenzioidea.. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did."
"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced.On 30 April 2017 the Daily Trust Newspaper reported that Tarzoor hopes to re-contest for the seat in the on-coming 2019 general elections..She subsequently placed in the top ten of the Miss America 2014 pageant, where she became the first contestant to openly display tattoos (during the swimsuit competition) and won the ""America's Choice"" award..It was chosen to represent Finland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Denmark..The operator testified that she confessed to her and that the gospel song, ""He Touched Me"" played in the background.. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   "
" I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.He is known as being the only performer to have won the Eurovision Song Contest twice, in 1980 and 1987..The partition led to one of the greatest population movements in the 20th century, as Muslims in what would become India, and Hindus and Sikhs in what would become Pakistan, fled across the new borders..At the contest, represented by Leon with ""Planet of Blue"", Germany failed to progress from the pre-qualification round, leading to the first time that Germany failed to participate at Eurovision..So Far is the first greatest hits compilation by East 17..  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time."
"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself.The International Pageant of Pulchritude, also known as Miss Universe or the International Beauty Contest, was a beauty contest that began in 1920, featuring contestants from multiple nations..His greatest achievement was the victory in the Oslo Dream Mile 1992 where he defeated the world champion Noureddine Morceli..Three tickets contested the election..Reinke crystals are rod-like cytoplasmic inclusions which can be found in Leydig cells of the testes.. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story."
"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph.Physical testing is common in physics, engineering, and quality assurance..In 1986, she released her debut album titled Breakthrough which included reworks of Bobby Benson's ""Taxi Driver"" and George Benson's ""The Greatest Love of All""..Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss..Or vice versa"".Though never formally disbanded, the Australian Commonwealth Party did not contest any other election nor seek party registration under later legislation.. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time."
"In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers.However, as Churches of Christ are autonomous local congregations and are intentionally non-denominational (and oppose such societies or boards as not part of the New Testament pattern), the sponsoring church arrangement exists so that individual congregations can co-operate on projects that one congregation alone would not be financially able to undertake, while maintaining local congregation oversight and control of the work..Charlottesville historic monument controversy is the public discussion on how the community of Charlottesville should respond to protesters who complain that various local monuments are racist..The ECEA releases publications, organizes violent free actions and campaigns and lobbies in the European Parliament, against animal testing..It covers an area of 5,444.2 km2, and had a population of 181,634 at the 2010 Census; the latest official estimate (for January 2014) is 187,851.. At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."
 I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese..
"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond.The 2016 Nevada Democratic caucuses took place on February 20 in the U.S. state of Nevada, traditionally marking the Democratic Party's third nominating contest in their series of presidential primaries ahead of the 2016 presidential election..There are 23 test centuries have been scored at the ground..After working for many years as a reporter, Caro wrote The Power Broker (1974), a biography of New York urban planner Robert Moses, which was chosen by the Modern Library as one of the hundred greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century..The party's only candidate in the 2005 general election was Adrian Davies, who contested South Staffordshire.. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."
. I think they think it will bring them luck
"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming.Some of the female contestants were nude models for Playboy or Penthouse, namely Erica Ellyson, Meghan Allen, Brittany Fuchs, and Stacy Fuson..In addition to teaching at Pace, she has appeared on News 12 Westchester and regularly lectures for law firms and companies including Kaplan Test Prep bar review programs and New Directions, a program for non-practicing lawyers interested in returning to the work-force..Work at Willow Run during 1953 included testing throttlable rocket motors and hypergolic propellants..Athletics events were contested at the 1977 Summer Universiade in Sofia, Bulgaria.. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng."
 Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better..

The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph."
"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it.Over the next few years, she resided in Guelph, Ontario, where she helped found the Bookshelf Poetry Contest..He was also one of the first five contestants inducted into the ""Survivor Hall of Fame"" in 2010, alongside Richard Hatch, Rob Mariano, Parvati Shallow, and Sandra Diaz-Twine..Taking place during the Second Party System and a political conflict over the re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, the elections were contested between Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party and opponents of Jackson, including the National Republicans..The election was held on 9 September 2012 and all 7 seats in Hong Kong Island were contested.. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test.It reached #60 on the Australian ARIA singles chart, and #83 in the 1999 Hottest 100..The mango variety was listed as the sweetest in the world by the 1995 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records..Finney also provided workshops for attorneys and judges on topics including sexual abuse, the psychology of enabling parents, and the reliability of testimony acquired through hypnosis..Perhaps though his greatest asset with the ball in his hand is his intuitive knowledge of what is right.. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times.However, the so-called tenth level was significant in that it was always the first time in which the actual test subject heard the other (false) test subject cry out in pain..The party did not register to contest the party vote in the 2014 election, but stood two electorate candidates, in Auckland Central and Rongotai..These high quality rinks, coupled with a research center devoted to testing skaters' athletic prowess, has established Pan American Arena as a primary training site for striving young hockey players and figure skaters..The competition is contested by the six top national netball teams in the world, according to the INF World Rankings.. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "
 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring..
"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it.Kim is Associate Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology, Virginia Union University in Richmond..It was launched in April 1988 and covers topics such as the latest news in new golfing gear, golf gear tests and reviews, tips from tour pros, course reviews and more..It is normally used to create computer wallpapers, which may be updated with the latest cloud maps or the regions of Earth which are in sunlight..He also played 11 Tests and 37 One Day Internationals for the West Indies, between 1993 and 1999, making his Test debut against India at Sabina Park, Jamaica in 1997.. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means."
 The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well..
"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well.Stewart and Andretti again finished first and second in Heat 2 and Pedro Rodriguez set fastest lap, quicker than Amon's time in Heat 1..The entrance test is held in May/June every year..The incident was followed by protests and civil unrest, which led to multiple arrests..The album's music evolved from tests of the portraiture system.. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."
"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy.The EMS is the first Arab professional effort done to provide an integrated surveying solution based on the use of the latest technologies and supported by theoretical and scientific standards and specifications..The 2019 AFC Asian Cup Final is an upcoming football match to determine the winner of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, the 17th edition of the AFC Asian Cup, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of the Asian Football Confederation..Thomas D. Schiano (born August 12, 1962), M.D., is an American specialist in liver transplantation, intestinal transplantation and in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic liver disease..Friend is a greatest hits album released in 2002 by S.E.S... @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring.There were several other tests presented in his paper besides the cube test..The NFL has issued as many as six random drug tests to players, with each player receiving at least one drug test per season..The GEFT is a timed test elapsing 20-minutes and can be administered to an individual or groups of older children (age 10+), adolescents, and adults..The bumps, called tubercles, on which short spines rest, can be seen on the underside of the test.. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready."
"The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1.. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.Beatty v. Guggenheim Exploration Co. (1919) 225 NY 380 is a New York state law case, concerning the test for the imposition of a constructive trust..Poland hosted the contest in 1994..The first version was used in testing the Negotiation System described in When Cyborgs Meet: Building Communities of Cooperating Wearable Agents, and as described in Modeling Wearable Negotiation in an Opportunistic Task Oriented Domain..As per usual, most of the songs on this album were road-tested prior to being recorded..” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."
