"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation.

For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying.

"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle..The admission into under graduate programs is through a state level common entrance test EAMCET..Regarded by many as one of the greatest players of all time, Smith has won the Dally M Medal as the NRL's player of the year in 2006 and 2017, the Golden Boot Award as the international player of the year in 2007 and 2017, and the NRL's Dally M Hooker of the Year on seven occasions..Occupy Berlin was a collaboration in Berlin, Germany that has included peaceful protests and demonstrations against unregulated financial markets and other alleged social injustices..The lyrics also allude to Neal Cassady, who was associated with the Beats in the 1950s and the Acid Test scene that spawned the Grateful Dead in the 1960s."

Saeng misses her home so much and she can’t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now”. Saeng didn’t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won’t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng’s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph..Tracks 1-4 & 12, were part of the band's greatest hits, Warning Shots..The Namibian Tri-Nations tournament is the second edition of the Tier 3 African tournament that coincides with the 2013 end-of-year rugby union tests..Her greatest success to date is her character 'Gia Kapur' in the Bollywood movie Kal Ho Na Ho, alongside Shahrukh Khan and Preity Zinta, where she plays the adopted daughter of Jaya Bachchan..14448, designated by number 64 on the list of Wright, is a Syriac manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment, according to the Peshitta version."

Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her.

"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better..The documentary is largely concerned with events up to the end of the second Test, with the third Test being dealt with via an textual epilog..Romans 9 is the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans in the New Testament of the Christian Bible..The album does however also function as a real stereo test recording..Ultimate Aerosmith Hits is a greatest hits album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released in 2002 by Columbia Records and Geffen Records."

"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     .19 countries participated, the 20 countries that took part at the previous 1978 Contest, except for Turkey which was also going to participate but eventually withdrew its entry for political reasons..The 1985 Bandy World Championship was contested between as many as five men's bandy playing nations, more than ever before, as the United States entered the championship for the first time..In late 2015 and early 2016, O'Brien collaborated with military scholar, William M.

"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything..Using various tactics such as protests, civil disobedience, and diplomatic negotiations, Washington and other community activists succeeded in saving the plots for continued use as community gardens..According to AllMusic's reviewer, Cobham is ""generally acclaimed as fusion's greatest drummer""..A medical encyclopedia is a comprehensive written compendium that holds information about diseases, medical conditions, tests, symptoms, injuries, and surgeries..In addition, the accuracy and efficacy of saliva testing has not been definitively proven, and the long-term effects of using blood testing to reach target levels of hormones have not been researched."

(for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again.

"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different..The resolution, passed under Chapter VII, Article 41, of the UN Charter, imposes a series of economic and commercial sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the DPRK, or North Korea) in the aftermath of that nation's claimed nuclear test of October 9, 2006..In this method, an IQ score of 100 means that the test-taker's performance on the test is at the median level of performance in the sample of test-takers of about the same age used to norm the test..At the annual National Rock Contest held in Nagaland in the Hornbill Festival in 2010, Guillotine won the second prize..This is a list of the various myths tested on the show as well as the results of the experiments (the myth is either Busted, Plausible, or Confirmed)."
" The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city.

"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next .

"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back.

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring.

"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad.

"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  .Wide World Over is a 40th anniversary, greatest hits-like compilation by the Irish musical group The Chieftains..Unit tests exercise individual functions, subroutines, or object methods..It was ranked number 214 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of ""The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time""..Shangela was the first contestant eliminated in season two, and returned as a surprise contestant in the series' third season, placing sixth."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great..This will allow scientists to test and to further understand the functioning of the Sun (e.g., nuclear fusion processes taking place at the core of the Sun, solar composition, opacities, matter distribution, etc.) and will also help determine properties of neutrino oscillations, including the MSW effect..The needle is inserted into the fabric and then the instrument is pulled to exert a specific force on the fabric in order to test..Its declared goal was to defend Ulster Protestant loyalist areas and to combat Irish republicanism, particularly the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA)..The 1988 annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank were met with an international protest in West Berlin."
" I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life..In language testing, it may also include student interviews and checklists (e.g., on a scale from 1 to 5 the student or teacher rates his or her ability to do such tasks as introducing one's family)..The song later appeared on Crowded House's greatest hits compilation Recurring Dream and was performed at the group's farewell concert Farewell to the World..The first contestant to reach the top wins ""a trip to reality""..The AmpliChip CYP450 Test uses micro array technology from Affymetrix (GeneChip) to determine the genotype of the patient in terms of two cytochrome P450 enzymes: 2D6 and 2C19."
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test..The plot concerns a Soviet scientist (Johnson), who defects and flees to a Nevada Test Site called Yucca Flats, only to be turned into a monster by radiation, stalking the desert..Testacella is the only genus in the family, in other words it is a monotypic family..How to Change the World is a documentary film, from writer-director Jerry Rothwell (Deep Water), which chronicles the adventures of an eclectic group of young pioneers who set out to stop Richard Nixon's nuclear bomb tests in Amchitka, Alaska, and end up creating the worldwide green movement with the birth of Greenpeace..There are certain Protestant denominations that do not disagree with the acceptability of human cloning."
"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  .The Roman soldiers came under a rain of missiles, but employed the testudo formation to protect themselves and dismantled the stone ramparts..It is assigned to the 53d Test and Evaluation Group, stationed at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada..Peter Douglas Parker (born 20 July 1959 in Herston, Queensland), is an Australian Test cricket match umpire..It does not cover bank proprietary, internal testing programs."
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year.

If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society..Everyone that lives anywhere near the accident suddenly has to wear masks, test everywhere for high levels of radiation, and watch everything they eat and drink to make sure it's not contaminated until the government gives the all clear..Kicoshep, a pioneer of the VCT concept, now has a network of Voluntary Counseling and Testing centers across Kenya..The incumbent Telugu Desam Party headed by chief minister N.

"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:– “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  .In 2012, the group's second greatest hits album Ten was released and entered the UK Albums Chart at number nine..Chamani Seneviratne has scored the most number of runs on debut test for Sri Lanka (148 runs in both innings) and she is also the leading runscorer for Sri Lanka in test matches, despite Sri Lanka Women's managing to play their only test in 1998..The protests in Berlin in the last years were the largest demonstrations against public surveillance since the boycott of the census in West Germany in the 1980s..The album has been reissued several times since with 14 track versions and the latest 20 track edition."

" The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind.

Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. She let herself by the flower and remember her home. That make her sad. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story.

"Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. .It is believed that Hope was personally responsible for most of the decorative woodwork on both the interior and exterior, including the latest example of the extensive use of manually planed moldings in a historic building in Oregon..Geminus, and he was adopted by testament by a Titus Prifernius Paetus..Some passports attest to status as a diplomat or other official, entitled to rights and privileges such as immunity from arrest or prosecution..DUnit is an automated unit testing framework for Borland Delphi."

" In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”. But I know this because its says “Then I will take that test again” her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant.

"In the story “winter Hibiscus“ by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried.

"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus.

"The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring.

" The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself.

"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her..Antonius Grech Delicata Testaferrata (21 February 1823 - 31 December 1876) was a Maltese bishop who became the second Bishop of Gozo in 1868..Bible Publishers, is a specialist publisher of Catholic and Protestant Bibles..This album marks the compilation debut of chart hits ""Words"" and ""The Girl I Knew Somewhere,"" which had been overlooked on the previous greatest hits albums..She has since stood again for parliament in the Asutifi South constituency, where her deceased husband had previously contested."
"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up.

It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test.

"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings.

"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”.

"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  .According to this text, the 7th-century Shaivite saint Sambandar defeated a group of Jain monks in a series of debates and contests on philosophy, and thereby converted a Jain Pandyan king to Shaivism..Sex Machine is often considered to be one of the greatest and most important soul records of all time, and arguably the high point of Brown's creative heyday from 1967-1971..It was speculated that there may have been some form of legal action against PeekVid, and that this ""beta testing"" screen was a way of bowing out temporarily without admitting defeat..In 885, the Emperor Charles III made him archchancellor of the Empire, for Konstanz was then the greatest diocese in Swabia, which had been Charles' original kingdom and was still his home most of the time."

"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that.

"  The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesn’t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter.

"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost.

"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant.

In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test..In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly also named him one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years..The tracks featured on this album consist of recordings previously featured on Greatest Hits and Black Beauties, other re-recorded songs not featured on the previous album, and live tracks..While a guest of Princess Marie in early 1912, Rilke began to write his Duino Elegies, a collection of ten long deeply philosophical and mystical poems which are considered to be his greatest work..Prometric, also known as Prometric Testing, is a U.S. company in the test administration industry."
"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph..The full translation includes the books of the standard Protestant canon as well as the Deuterocanonical books traditionally included in the canons of Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity..This type of picture-naming test is also useful in the examination of children with learning disabilities and the evaluation of brain-injured adults..Beginning in 1997, the Wheat Bowl Football Classic was successfully switched to a pre-season contest to eliminate several potential obstacles: the possibility of inclement weather, conflicts with Kansas State University and University of Kansas home games as well as conflicts with high school playoffs..It is measured with a blood test and is sometimes useful in medical diagnosis to differentiate between causes of liver damage, or hepatotoxicity."

"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader..Originally from Tweed Heads, Saddler played for Sydney club Eastern Suburbs in the years 1963-64 and 1966-71.An Aboriginal center, Saddler was selected for the 1967/68 Kangaroo Tour, playing in 12 matches, but no tests..Though strongly contested by the United States and the government of Israel, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed support for the measure..FCC tests in 1960 confirmed that the Zenith/GE stereo system was compatible with 67 kHz SCA operation, although not 41 kHz..William Alphonsus ""Wee Willie"" Crilley (born 1901 in Cowcaddens, Scotland; 1955 in New York City) was a Scottish-American football (soccer) forward who holds the record for the greatest number of goals scored by an Alloa Athletic player in a single season of the Scottish Football League."
" The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test..Her debut came in an innings defeat to Australia, a match in which she took her only Test wicket..There have been many papers published on this subject, and there is a contest to find the best solutions for certain specific schedules..The team of engineers perform on site equipment calibrations and PAT Testing, as required by the CQC.Founded in 2005, the company quickly outgrew its original head office of Loughton, Essex and moved to a new building and distribution center based in Nazeing, Essex..The 2019 AFC Asian Cup Final is an upcoming football match to determine the winner of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, the 17th edition of the AFC Asian Cup, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of the Asian Football Confederation."

"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph..The MSLT is used extensively to test for narcolepsy, to distinguish between physical tiredness and true excessive daytime sleepiness, or to assess whether treatments for breathing disorders are working..I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag's dark humor and satire made it one of the most recognized protest songs against the Vietnam War..Over 350 Syriac manuscripts of the New Testament have survived into the present..Tatarstan are one of the twenty-four participating countries and regions competing in the first Turkvision Song Contest scheduled to take place between the 17 and 21 December 2013."
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph..It was written by Emily Shackelton as an entry for the American Idol Songwriting Contest 2008..In the fifth Test at Sydney of the 1930-31 tour, he scored 123 not out in the first innings against the strong Australian bowling of the day, part of the West Indies' 350 for 6..These depictions began to encounter protests from Muslims, and in the age of the internet, a handful of caricature depictions printed in the European press have caused global protests and controversy, and been associated with violence..During a clip titled ""Tony talks about his inspiration"" on the When in Rome 2007 DVD, Banks states that his inspiration for the song lyrics was the 1982 Lebanon War which was still being contested prior to the recording of Invisible Touch."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way..According to Statistics South Africa's latest Tourism and Migration Survey, almost 3,5 million travelers passed through the country's ports of entry in August 2017..His latest album, Noen ganger og andre (Some times and others), was the best selling Norwegian-language album of 2017 in Norway..Saint James the Great Church is a large Protestant church in the city of Flushing, Netherlands..Herbert Milton Stempel (born December 19, 1926) is an American television game show contestant and subsequent whistleblower on the fraudulent nature of the industry, in what became known as the quiz show scandals."
"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it.

"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way..Hey Venus! is the band's first full-length release on current label Rough Trade Records and, at just over 36 minutes, is also their shortest-running studio release..Although it is an IB school, the IAM is still considered a public school, but it requires students to pass a test and get drawn in a lottery to become enrolled..In 2000 it was selected by Classic Rock as one of the ""30 Best Albums of the 90s"", and in 2003 as one of ""Rock's 30 Greatest Concept Albums""..It compiled his hit singles released in 1956 and 1957, and is widely believed to be the first greatest hits album in rock and roll history."
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  .The technique relies on the removal of dsDNA formed by hybridization between a control and test sample, thus eliminating cDNAs or gDNAs of similar abundance, and retaining differentially expressed, or variable in sequence, transcripts or genomic sequences..In a case of an intestacy, the court determines who is to receive the deceased's property under the law of its jurisdiction..The Libertarian Party of Wisconsin met this test in 2014 with the candidacies of Madison attorney Tom Nelson for Attorney General (3%), Milwaukee political consultant Andy Craig for secretary of state (3%), and former Mayor Jerry Shidell of Rhinelander for state treasurer (2%)..The Alaska Aces is a professional basketball team in the Philippine Basketball Association since 1986 under the ownership of the Alaska Milk Corporation and the owner of 14 PBA championships with the 2013 PBA Commissioner's Cup as their latest."
"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered..The only year that they won any games in Pool B was 1992 (at that time it was contested between nations ranked 13th to 20th), defeating Japan, China, and Yugoslavia..P.

"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring.

" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended.

When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again.

So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end.

"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus.

"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through.

" It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it.

The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to.

"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time.

It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring.

"The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that..He contested the Central Provincial seat at the 2012 election and ousted Governor Alphonse Moroi; initially elected as an independent, he immediately joined the governing People's National Congress..He also played in the 2nd Test at the MCG over the New Year, which Australia won again..In 2003, while auditioning for Australian Idol, he also became the first queer contestant to openly appear on a reality TV talent show..The University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL) is an independent test facility that provides interoperability and standards conformance testing for networking, telecommunications, data storage, and consumer technology products."
"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng..Donors are still screened and tested..The Five were important in their own right in developing an independent Russian voice and consciousness in classical music, the compositions of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky became dominant in 19th century Russia, with Tchaikovsky becoming known both in and outside Russia as its greatest musical talent..The game allows the player to control an NFL team and become the greatest coach in NFL history..Among the pioneers in this arena, maximum attention is claimed by the Jesuit missionaries, followed by the Protestant Fathers and Hindu Pandits."
"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature.

" When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time.

"The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring..It also functions as a greatest hits package, as it includes many of singer Kirk McLeod's compositions from previous releases, newly arranged for the band's revised lineup..With onset usually around middle age, potential parents must be tested if they wish to avoid passing FFI on to their children..At the time the XB-7 was ordered, it was being tested by Douglas Aircraft as an observational plane..Caught by the Fuzz (1994), to their then latest release, ""Kiss of Life"" (2004)."
"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does.With the exception of Tanas, the other four members were all contestants of the 2007 Super Boy, the male counterpart of Super Girl..It is still a very popular spot for organizing protests..Benjamin Fairbanks was an 18th-century farmer and selectmen from Dedham, Massachusetts who received the lightest sentence of anyone ever convicted under the Sedition Act of 1798..The men's race was first contested in 1987 and the women's race began in 1989."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it.

So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home..It is one of the shortest releases by Boards of Canada, barely breaking the 13-minute mark..The Cream of Eric Clapton is a greatest hits album by English guitar player Eric Clapton..The NRL's main championship, called the 2011 Telstra Premiership due to sponsorship from Telstra, was contested by sixteen teams for the fifth consecutive year..The tour consisted of one Twenty20 (T20), five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Tests."

"She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding.

"The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today..Contested over 250 laps on the 2 mile (3.23 km) speedway, it was the 10th race of the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season..The group represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in the first semifinal on 12 May and qualified for the final..The Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture (until 1991 the Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture) is a chair in theology, particular Old Testament studies, at the University of Oxford..It was first contested in 1925 but was canceled in 1972 due to waning public interest."
"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2].

"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph).

" In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment..The song is meant to protest the practice of sagging..The original formulation was that the magnitudes of the black-white differences on tests of cognitive ability positively correlate with the tests' g-loading..Rebecca Lush is an environmental activist who was influential during the 1990s and early 2000s when she helped organize a number of major UK road protests including those against the M3 Extension at Twyford Down, the M11 link road and the Newbury bypass..His position is flanker, and he has played 14 tests for the Canadian national team."
"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she.

Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, ….In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again.

Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it.

It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said”she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.” This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     .The role of grammatical relations in theories of grammar is greatest in dependency grammars, which tend to posit dozens of distinct grammatical relations..They can be used for testing experimental and prototype aircraft or modifications, pre-delivery flights for foreign customers and are sometimes referred to as ""B"" class markings..He also represented New Zealand at the Under 19 Cricket World Cup in Malaysia in and in New Zealand's Under 19 tour of England in 2008 where he played in two test matches and five one day games..Particularly, researchers are advised to develop all test schedules and data collection limits beforehand."

"The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject..Some countries did not gain their independence on a single date, therefore the latest day of independence is shown with a break down of dates further down..The anti-immigration National Front polled 11% in the wards it contested in Bradford (down from 15% in 1971) and 8% of the wards it contested in Leicester..These NSAIDs, while reducing inflammation, also thin the blood (especially aspirin) and increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers/bleeds..The footballers enjoyed their greatest successes through the latter half of the 1970s."
"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test.

"The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she’s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change.

"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good.

" The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant.

"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant “dies” in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle..As a prominent military structure in downtown Toronto, it has been the site of a number of anti-war protests..The live version of the song ranked No. 37 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time..De Villiers captained South Africa in all formats, but since his injuries, he stepped down from Test captaincy and continued in limited over formats..The most-commonly used phenotypic tests to identify and distinguish Mycobacterium strains and species from each other are described below."

" The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers.

"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn’t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, “but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.” thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  .Electroscopes detect electric charge by the motion of a test object due to the Coulomb electrostatic force..Cummins is widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the game..One of the gliders was used to test the aerodynamics of a prototype World War II Horten jet fighter-bomber..Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects in vitro are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out."

"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again.

" The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task.Test Drive Cycles is a 2000 video game within the Test Drive video game series where the player drives motorcycles..However, the so-called tenth level was significant in that it was always the first time in which the actual test subject heard the other (false) test subject cry out in pain..The three dozen student protestors, meanwhile, were collectively awarded US$1 million by UC Davis in a settlement from a federal lawsuit, with each pepper-sprayed student receiving $30,000 individually..Oberon is the diminutive manager of Mister Miracle, the world's greatest escape artist."
" The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way..The Ultimate Collection is a Jimmy Buffett greatest hits compilation album consisting of 2 compact disks and 38 songs..The Party for Freedom only contested the cities of Almere and The Hague, where it became the largest and second-largest party respectively in both cities..A regular member of the Indian Test team, he also represents Tamil Nadu in first-class cricket and Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League..For his role in organizing the 2011 Azerbaijani protests, he was charged with attempting ""violent overthrow"" of the government."

"The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home.

"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng.

" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again.

"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story.

" In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected..In 1992 after it was discovered that he had previously falsified a NATOPS EA-6B proficiency test by having a junior Officer complete the test for him, and submit it as his own results..Isaiah 22 is the twenty-second chapter of the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible..He contested the Khonsa East seat in the 2009 Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election as a BJP candidate..A left-handed batsman and left-arm spin bowler, he played nine Tests, with a highest score of 214 not out, and eight One Day International matches."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. .Tamil Nadu UnitOn 2 September 2015, Balakrishnan was arrested for refusing to call off a protest at a train station as part of a strike..The team was named following a name the team contest that included West Penn United and Pittsburgh Rebellion as the other two options..Recommissioning is the methodical process of testing and adjusting the aforementioned systems in existing buildings..Martin John McCague (born 24 May 1969) is a cricketer who played for the England cricket team in 3 Tests from 1993 to 1994."
"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.

"The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again..A recipient of two NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards, five first-team All-Pro selections, and ten Pro Bowl appearances, Greene is widely considered one of the greatest defensive linemen to play in the NFL..Eleven matches were contested at the event, ten of which took place live on pay-per-view..Played as either a jig or a reel, it is attested to as a popular tune from at least 1834 in New England..It was contested for the first time in the 2017 election."
"“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers.

"I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels..He finished his NBA career with an average of 4.9 points on 10.5 minutes in fourteen contests..Rational Performance Tester is a tool for automated performance testing of web- and server-based applications from the Rational Software division of IBM..Eddy-current testing (also commonly seen as eddy current testing and ECT) is one of many electromagnetic testing methods used in nondestructive testing (NDT) making use of electromagnetic induction to detect and characterize surface and sub-surface flaws in conductive materials..Benjamin Lee Merkle (born 1971) is an American New Testament scholar."
"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1.

Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason.

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver’s test. To Saeng her failing the driver’s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng’s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn’t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted.

"The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the “test” again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she “failed the test”, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow..He has testified before Congress, including: June 4, 2013 - Testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee about alleged political abuses by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) during the Obama administration..It has gone through a series of tests and regulations in order to evaluate the risks and hazards to the environment and animals..Design contests have challenged architects to offer their visions of the structures..After it ceased operation in 2008, a fan-led open source project was attempted before Real Baseball's successor, Big League Online, was released for beta testing in early 2011."

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by: Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is try to adjust to @LOCATION1 coming from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes “saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers.

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home. .The wicketkeeper-batsman Imtiaz Ahmed played all four Tests..The Democratic Front was the only party able to contest the elections, and subsequently won all 188 seats..The UFOs were explained as flares, which the Army was testing from a higher altitude..The test implies that a person can identify an unknown subject by observing that subject's habitual characteristics."
"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she’ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she’s stating once everything “come back to life” then she’ll feel like she will pass it next time.

" The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did.

"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again.

A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed.

"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal..This compound has been known to have immunostimulant, antiviral, antineoplastic and gastrointestinal properties..Sailing has been a sport of the Pan American Games since the inaugural 1951 Pan American Games, being contested in every edition, except for the 1955 edition..In the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie defeated Oxford's Isis in the fastest time ever, while Cambridge won the Women's Boat Race..It is in effect a greatest hits album for both of the bands, the first seven tracks bracketed together as ""The Housemartins Condensed"" and the remaining fifteen as ""The Cream of The Beautiful South""."
"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes..The Whatsit was a swept-wing, tail-less airplane designed by Waldo Waterman between 1911 (when he first got the idea) and 1932 (when the prototype was finally in testing phase)..He is also the guest test rider for Britain's biggest motorcycle monthly - Bike Magazine..In the sixteenth annual Treehouse of Horror, the Simpsons replace Bart with a robot son after Bart falls into a coma, Homer and various other male characters find themselves on a reality show where Mr. Burns hunts humans for sport, and costumed Springfieldians become whatever they are wearing, thanks to a witch who was disqualified from a Halloween costume contest..Test captains are listed chronologically from the first time they captained Australia in a Test match."

"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things..Jeremiah 2 is the second chapter of the Book of Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible..Devine and Team 3D were the victors in the contest..At age 34, Australian Business Magazine named him in the ""Brightest and Best"" top 40 headhunted executives in Australia..Rippability studies can involve the performance of seismic refraction traverses, the drilling of borings with an air percussion drill rig, the excavation of test trenches with a bulldozer with rippers or backhoe, and by geologic mapping."

"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  .The film premiered to critical success, and was the fastest-selling Australian film at the Melbourne International Film Festival 2015, finishing in the top 10 for the MIFF Audience Award..I Dreamed a Dream: The Susan Boyle Story was a one-off television special, starring Scottish singer Susan Boyle, produced for ITV, that aired on 13 December 2009 in the United Kingdom, reflecting the success that Susan Boyle has had since appearing on UK talent show Britain's Got Talent and since her debut album, I Dreamed a Dream, became the fastest selling debut album of all time..400 Days is a 2015 American science fiction film written and directed by Matt Osterman and starring Brandon Routh, Caity Lotz, Ben Feldman, and Dane Cook as astronauts sent on a 400-day-long simulated mission to a distant planet to test the psychological effects of deep space travel..Krajowe Eliminacje (National Qualification) is the Polish national selection for the country's entry to the Eurovision Song Contest."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces..According to the IMF, Ethiopia was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, registering over 10% economic growth from 2004 through 2009..The 2011 Wafu Club Championship (sometimes referred to as the Eyadema Unity Cup) is an association football competition that will be contested between club sides in the WAFU/UFOA region..Arthur Schopenhauer cited Tristram Shandy as one of the greatest novels ever written..Their American-made military revolvers (Colt revolvers) were far superior to the arms used by the other contestants."

"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence.

"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk.

This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time..Luke 4 is the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament of the Christian Bible..Under the act the Office of Public Road Inquiries and the Division of Tests within the Bureau of Chemistry were merged effective July 1, 1905 to form the Office of Public Roads..To test for the existence (or absence) of the Nordtvedt effect, scientists have used the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, which is capable of measuring the distance between the Earth and the Moon with near-millimeter accuracy..AscentialTest provides automated testing support for the following application types including MS Windows, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Java, dotNet (Winforms and WPF), terminals, Siebel and PowerBuilder."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1.

After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time.

"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on..This allowed Microsoft testers to try many different configurations, but the feature remained in the shipped version..The resulting by-election was contested by the publican and political novice Michael Hart, and by Sewell, who had returned from England..In addition, ""casting calls"" are held regularly in major US cities to offer opportunities for women to test for Playboy..Sarah was a judge in the 2007 Chris Austin Songwriting Contest."
"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did..Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster in the constellation of Corona Borealis containing over 400 member galaxies, the brightest of which are 16th magnitude..In 2014, Maslow competed as a contestant on the eighteenth season of Dancing with the Stars, in which he reached fourth place..The Catholic Church recognized it only recently, and often sends its official representatives in ecumenical spirit to various commemoration events held by Protestants..The result of the contest was a victory for the Labor candidate, Alec Jones, who won with a majority of 2,306 over the Plaid Cymru's H.

"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful..It started as a simple ""pencil test"" program by Patrick Corrieri, extended to the current Pencil application mainly by Pascal Naidon..Intending to switch to a political career, she unsuccessfully contested Nottingham North at the 2005 general election..In 2013, at the 42nd Annual Juno Awards, Klaasen won a Juno in the World Music Album of Year category for her latest album A Tribute to Miriam Makeba..From 2011 to 2014, an online championship sanctioned by Supercars was contested on iRacing."
" He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something.

"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it..Brought up at Douai as a Roman Catholic by Jesuit priests, he was converted to Protestantism in 1682 and came to abjure popery, and published Protestancy proved Safer than Popery (1686)..This distinctive form of Critical Mass, occasionally called Critical Ass in a WNBR context, is often described or categorized as a form of political protest, street theater, party-on-wheels, streaking, public nudity and clothing-optional recreation, and thus attracts a wide range of participants..In September 2004, the NLC gave the federal government an ultimatum to reverse the decision to reintroduce the controversial fuel tax or face a nationwide protest strike..In October 2010, it was voted ninth in the Greatest Guitar Riffs of the 21st Century so far by Total Guitar magazine."

"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   .The tests detonated implosion-type boosted-fission military-grade plutonium devices, contrary to the Chagai-I tests that were weapons-grade uranium devices..Key parameters for this standard are the kinematic viscosity of the gear oil, the maximum temperature at which the oil has a viscosity of 150,000 cP, and a measure of its shear stability through the KRL test..In 2014, she was a finalist in the BBC One talent contest The Voice, finishing in joint second place..Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf is a golf-simulation video game developed by Sculptured Software, and published by Accolade in 1988."
" I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time..The show caused some controversy, as it was discovered that Tamara Puljarevic, one of the contestants, applied under her father's surname to hide her identity of being the daughter of Svetlana Puljarevic, who is the executive chief of Miss magazine, on whose cover the winner would eventually be featured..The greatest number of eclipses in one year was four, occurring in 6 different years: 1372 BC, 1354 BC, 1336 BC, 1332 BC, 1318 BC, and 1307 BC..In 2010 he released his latest book, American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People..It was chosen as the 4th greatest album of the decade by prominent critic Robert Christgau."
"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them.

"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph.

"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time..Considered by critics as one of the greatest cricketers ever played, Taylor became the highest ODI century maker for New Zealand surpassing 16 by Nathan Astle, on 22 February 2017, with his 17th ODI century..In 2003, the American Film Institute ranked Mr. Chipping the 41st greatest film hero of all time..In his review of the album for AllMusic, Cub Koda described it as ""almost a mini-greatest-hits package in and of itself"" and the most perfectly realized collection of Berry's career..Radiochromic film is a type of self-developing film typically used in the testing and characterisation of radiographic equipment such as CT scanners and radiotherapy linacs."

"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng..He resigned in order to contest the seat of Geraldton in the Legislative Assembly at the 2017 state election..The final was contested by Ulsan Hyundai Mipo Dolphin and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors..He contested the constituency of Ilford South six times from October 1974 to 1997, and was the Member of Parliament for the seat from 1979 to 1992, when he lost by 402 votes to Labor's Mike Gapes..In December 2013 it was announced he would be contesting the seat of Huon in the Tasmanian Legislative Council as an endorsed Liberal, but he was defeated by Robert Armstrong, an independent."

"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home.

"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes..The first is a means-tested bursary which is available for all students whose parents earn under a threshold value per annum..The stadium has hosted 1 Test, 3 ODIs and 8 T20Is till date..At these contests, Ahvenlahti was part of the Finnish commentary team..Tom Hadfield founded his latest site in 2009, AeroDesigns, Inc after graduating from Harvard University, and now acts as its Chief Executive Officer."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. .All-Time Top 100 TV Themes is the ninth volume of the Television's Greatest Hits series of compilation albums by TVT Records..Be a VJ contest on MTV..This compilation CD received some mixed reviews, however, because its emphasis was on songs performed on the duo's reunion tour, rather than a familiar ""greatest hits"" album..The first and shortest version was published in Beyond Fantasy Fiction in July 1954 under the title ""No More Stars"" with the pseudonym Charles Satterfield."

"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough.

"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects..It is also the 6th fastest developing city of UP..In marketing, multivariate testing or multi-variable testing techniques apply statistical hypothesis testing on multi-variable systems, typically consumers on websites..The side was made up of current Australian international cricketers and some recently retired former Test players..Outside the Bible Belt there are other sizable communities of Calvinist Protestants, such as in Rijssen."
"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her..After unsuccessfully contesting the House of Representatives seat of Brand for the Liberal Party in the 2004 and 2007 federal elections, he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Council for South Metropolitan in 2008..At 27 years old she appeared in the first season of Colombian musical competition La Voz Colombia, and was part of Team Ricardo Montaner winning the contest on the final held on December 20, 2012; She received a monetary prize, a contract with the label Universal Music, in addition to sharing the stage with Carlos Vives and Alejandro Sanz in Feria de Manizales..The Switzerland national netball team represent Switzerland in international netball tests and competitions..A successful test was conducted on New Year's Day of 1890.The tower was built much as it appears today."
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready..Argon plasma coagulation or APC is a medical endoscopic procedure used primarily to control bleeding from certain lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, and also sometimes to debulk tumors in the case of patients for whom surgery is not recommended..The new stimulus is assigned to a category based on the greatest number of similarities it holds with exemplars in that category..The Front-end Robotics Enabling Near-term Demonstration (FREND) is a DARPA project ""aiming to create a fully autonomous docking capability for satellites that weren't built to be serviced"", currently under testing at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Spacecraft Engineering Department..From this edition forward, the Recopa Sudamericana will be contested over two legs."

"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it..Greatest Hits (2000) would become Kravitz's most successful album to date, going on to sell over 10.5 million copies worldwide, earning him yet another Grammy Award..Modern cognitive tests originated through the work of James McKeen Cattell who coined the term ""mental tests""..It was chosen to represent Finland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Denmark..Marino debuted at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2013 held in Kiev, Ukraine."
