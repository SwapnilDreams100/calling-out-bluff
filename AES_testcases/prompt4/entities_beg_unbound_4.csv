"A BUILDING at the controversial Don Dale Youth Detention Centre in Darwin caught fire during a riot late last night that police struggled to contain..It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."

As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."

Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time.

If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "

To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding.

While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."

When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”.

Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.

"Les deux enquêtes visant les comptes de campagne de Jean-Luc Mélenchon pour la présidentielle de 2017 et les assistants d'eurodéputés de la France ....I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."

She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."
