The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion.

The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."

For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will.

So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."

The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant.

If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."

""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in.

The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."

For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."

Firefighters..It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."

The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test."

She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."

The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."

Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."

First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time.

If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "

The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons."

It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change.

Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit.

The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task"

To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."

The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again.

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."

The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "

The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."

Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did."

The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism.

The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."

As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming.

Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."

This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng.

First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means."

The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test.
