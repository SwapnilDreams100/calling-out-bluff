"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again.

"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior.He Lost the Indian general election, 2014 From Diamond Harbor Parliamentary Election,Contesting with Abhishek Banerjee of Trinamool Congress..For an article on Hinduism specifically in Northern Ireland, see Hinduism in Northern Ireland Hinduism in the Republic of Ireland is one of the fastest-growing religions by percentage..Many people were surprised that the track reached number 26 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2002, and some fans of other bands were upset that Anderson and Spencer had influenced the music poll..In 2007, Nijman was selected in the Dutch squad for its inaugural Test match..

"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering.

There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     "
"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring.

" The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more.

"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test.

Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become..Semenya was asked to take a gender test and Ogoegbunam tested positive for anabolic steroids..He is currently a host of the music show National Singing Contest..It appears in several hymnals, including the German Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch..The Mid-York Color Guard Circuit was created in 1965 to organize a color guard (also known as winter guard) circuit to conduct and regulate contests for all eligible members and to establish standardized rules and policies that will promote and regulate competition enabling young adults to participate in an activity that is educational, enjoyable, safe, equitable and ethical... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas."

Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test."
"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength.

"The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it’s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng “cheep skip over live to you’re back she saw cheerfully” @CAPS1 it’s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to"

"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home.On November 10, 2016, three days of protests in Portland, Oregon, turned into a riot, when a group of self-described anarchists broke off from a larger group of peaceful protesters who were opposed to the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States..He played five Tests and 11 One Day Internationals..The actual test methodology used for testing focal plane arrays differs depending on the type of device..Each year, thousands of people line the streets of downtown Scranton on Parade Day to take part in one of the city's greatest traditions..

With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that’s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can’t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now”. Saeng didn’t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won’t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her.Freedom of speech has suffered a few blows since the killing of activists and bloggers making the country unsafe to freely report news or protest..He also umpired a number of international matches, including Youth Test matches, Youth One Day Internationals and Women's One Day Internationals..Mark Lehman Strauss is an American biblical scholar and professor of the New Testament at Bethel Seminary San Diego, which is part of Bethel University, Minnesota..Some commentators consider ""I'm the Greatest"" to be one of Starr's signature tunes.. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng’s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."
"The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.Differential testing finds semantic bugs by using different implementations of the same functionality as cross-referencing oracles, pinpointing differences in their outputs across many inputs: any discrepancy between the program behaviors on the same input is marked as a potential bug..Johnny Test started its fourth season on September 10, 2009, containing 26 full episodes..The 1947 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships were contested in March 1947 at the Pavilion Pool at the University of Washington in Seattle at the 11th annual NCAA-sanctioned swim meet to determine the team and individual national champions of men's collegiate swimming and diving in the United States..He claimed that an opponent would be contesting the primary without having registered a candidate committee with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission..The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes."
"The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything’s going to be alright.

Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it’s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph."
" The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring.ISIS captured Sinjar and a number of other towns in the August 2014 offensive, but Sinjar became a contested city in December 2014..More recent performances of certain songs have featured Allen playing a four-string Fender Jazz Bass strung with normal electric guitar strings in place of his usual guitar set-up; and this appeared on their latest studio album, entitled Casually Smashed to Pieces, and was credited as ""mid-range bass""..A small needle is inserted through the skin of the scrotum to collect sperm from the epididymis, where sperm are usually stored after production in the testes..As the X-37B program is examining the affordability and reusability of space vehicles, validation through testing is vital to the process.. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country."
"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”.The combination of hypospadias and an undescended testicle sometimes indicates a disorder of sexual differentiation, and so additional testing may be recommended..The mechanics behind the test are as follows: 1..Products tested on animals are not considered cruelty-free, since these tests are often painful and cause the suffering and death of millions of animals every year..The Bagnolians were a sect in the 8th century, deemed heretical, who rejected the Old Testament and part of the New Testament.. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."
"The story like this for mine reasons. First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two.If a scientist sets up a computerized thermometer which records the temperature of a chemical mixture in a test tube every minute, the list of temperature readings for every minute, as printed out on a spreadsheet or viewed on a computer screen is ""raw data""..The forename Dubh Themrach is attested only once, in the obit of a woman who died in 1231..The ground has hosted 74 Test matches, the first of these was played in 1899 between England and Australia..It is humorously called ""Dick Trick"" or ""genital origami,"" referring to the flexibility of the human penis, testicles and scrotum.. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that."
"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months.Early tests revealed that the Snowspeed prototype III design needed a bit more rear-end stability, and those adjustments are the team's focus during 2016, before an attempt on the record is due to be made towards the end of winter 2017..She has been selected as Look of the Year contest winner for Femina magazine in 1997..The event coordinator, Heather LeBlanc, intentionally made early stages easier for the contestants and the final stretch difficult..Numerous major works of literature are mentioned as part of the contest.. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     "

"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country.In Britain, Manilow's first Greatest Hits album had been issued as Manilow Magic, thus this second volume was issued there as A Touch More Magic..Her final on-air appearance for ABC News was in 2015.In 1996, Walters was ranked #34 on the TV Guide ""50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time"" list, and in 2000 she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences..It designs, develops, manufactures, and sells commercial electronic test and measurement instruments for scientific, service, educational, industrial, and government applications..The administrative inclusion of Metsovo in the Ottoman Sanjak of Trikala in the mid-15th century would require corresponding changes in the ecclesiastic administration, but this is not attested before the mid-17th century, when Metsovo was under the Metropolis of Stagoi.. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."
"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying.Flynn's tenure of just 24 days was the shortest in the office's history..Crowe first appeared on the World's Greatest Magic in the late 1990s..They are the only couple that have got zero points in the contest..Uncial 0248 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament.. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past."
"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world.The 1991 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships were contested in March 1991 at the Texas Swimming Center at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas at the 68th annual NCAA-sanctioned swim meet to determine the team and individual national champions of Division I men's collegiate swimming and diving in the United States..The company specializes in producing work from a left-wing stance, seeking to create work that ""articulates flaws in the mainstream perception of Australian culture and identity, contesting how Australians think about themselves as a nation and as a people""..Rabusa testified that all of the AFP chiefs of staff were recipients of send-off money; they all denied knowingly receiving such send-off money..The Rocket Testing site is free to enter, although the Old Battery requires a small fee.."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .One of the main problems Minardi always had with the car was the lack of wind-tunnel testing, only managing 12 days in the Fondmetal windtunnel..England played five games, including a test match against the New Zealand national rugby union team and a match against the Fiji national rugby union team for which England did not award full internationals caps..Lissotesta errata is a species of minute sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc, un,assigned in the superfamily Seguenzioidea..In a test session prior the meeting, Richard Petty set an unofficial lap record for the Thunderdome of 28.2 seconds for an average speed of 142.85 mp/h..When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”."
"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion.At six months old, she began modeling for magazine covers such as Parents and took part in several contests including Elite Model Look (Elite-Glamor-Canal+) France, Miss Suisse romande and Miss Suisse..The city is home to the University of Lincoln and Bishop Grosseteste University, and to Lincoln City Football Club..Doce was the winner of the Portuguese national final for the contest, held on 6 March..More than 750 people testified.. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."
" The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city.On the 2006 PBS television program African American Lives, the musician Quincy Jones had his DNA tested; the test showed him to be of Tikar descent..Fern test refers to detection of a characteristic 'fern like' pattern of cervical mucus when a specimen of cervical mucus is allowed to dry on a glass slide and is viewed under a low-power microscope..Originally released on Bragg's short-lived record label, Utility Records, it is a deliberately political album, consisting mainly of cover versions and rewrites of left-wing protest songs..Planning of a German-built trade and research vessel to test the feasibility of nuclear power in civil service began in 1960 under the supervision of the German physicist Erich Bagge.. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty."
"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .Mikaze's second reign was the shortest in the history of the title losing it to Sean Burke moments after winning the vacant championship..Segments of these program will be more profound such as Ivan's Talk of Current Issues, Mariz' 'Female Style, Gadgets, and Awareness, Techie Talk, Valeries' Exclusives Talks, Interviews and Latest Fashion Spots, lastly Tonipet's Top Favorites in Cuisines more popularly known as Tara Let's Eat..First testing of this radar was in March 2009..A unique feature of the Test estate was an Olympic-sized swimming pool with a three-story diving tower and motorized surfboard pulley system, and alongside of the pool, an ornate brick ""pool house"" with guest quarters..This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."
"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1.Mala (in Northern Sotho) is intestines, usually of a mammal such as a cow or sheep..Overall, only two Test centuries have been scored at the ground..Wired named Taykey one of its ""Hottest Startups"" for 2013, and Forbes named co-founder and CEO Amit Avner to its ""30 Under 30"" list for 2014.In November 2017, Innovid announced an acquisition of Taykey..Thus, these models can be tested using a database with appropriate methods of analysis.. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once.Fountain was the first baseball player to be used as a Specialist Fielding Coach by any test level cricket team when he was hired in 1998 by the West Indies to coach on their tour of South Africa..Red Beach Red Beach is a suburb surrounding the beach of the same name on the Hibiscus Coast, Auckland, New Zealand, at the base of the Whangaparaoa Peninsula..There are 27 species with a neotropical distribution, with the greatest diversity in Brazil, while 3 are found in Central America..In an experiment to test the blissful ignorance effect, two groups were created and told information about a product.. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1."
"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS.It charted at number two on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 2007 and missed out on the number-one spot by only 13 votes..It was also used to refer to Aramean kings in the Greek translations of the Old Testament; mainly indicating the kings of Aram-Damascus..This season was won by the youngest contestant from the history of Indonesian Idol, at 16 year-old, Maria Simorangkir, from Medan, North Sumatra with Ahmad Abdul as the runner-up..1 John 3 is the third chapter of the First Epistle of John in the New Testament of the Christian Bible..

"" ""I’d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it.The greatest potential for injury while rock climbing occurs when a lead climber falls..Test of Wills is the third studio album by the progressive metal/rock band Magellan..Fly FM is the second most popular English radio station in Malaysia, besides being the fastest growing radio station in the country..The character has been depicted as a member of the Thunderbolts and was created by a comic book fan for a ""Create-A-Villain"" contest sponsored by Marvel and Wizard Magazine and the alter-ego was created by Kurt Busiek.. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way."
"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".James Carleton Paget (born 1966) is Senior Lecturer in New Testament Studies in the Faculty of Divinity of the University of Cambridge..Mill owners took to shooting protesters and eventually the movement was suppressed with military force..In 2003, the album was ranked No. 286 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time..She has defended political protesters during the Arab Spring protests..This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."
"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will.Peter David Heyn (born June 26, 1945, Colombo) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who played 18 unofficial tests from 1966 to 1976, and two ODIs in the World Cup 1975..She played a total of four Tests scoring a total of 76 runs and taking two wickets..Known as the ""land of steady habits"" for its political, social and religious conservatism, the colony prospered from the trade and farming of its ethnic English, Protestant population..80 contestants competed in this year which was broadcast and distributed globally via NBC in English and Telemundo in Spanish to TV outlets in more than 180 countries.. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again.A professional competitor since 2007, he also competed for Strikeforce, Titan FC, and was a contestant on Fight Master: Bellator MMA..This was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.The song ranked number 128 on the Rolling Stone list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time..It was awarded to members of the South African Defense Force for acts of the most conspicuous courage or greatest heroism..Barrett has played at under-20 and Sevens levels for New Zealand before being called into the All Blacks' training squad in May 2012 and made his international debut as a replacement in the final test against Ireland in Hamilton, when he kicked nine points, in June 23, 2012.. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."
" I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive.In 2007, the station returned to the air for a short period on channel 48, with an analog signal displaying a test pattern with the call sign and channel number..He also is currently the latest African-American Astronaut to fly in space..A legatee, in the law of wills, is any individual or organization bequeathed any portion of a testator's estate..These activities included the development of detonators and other equipment, testing of bomb shapes dropped from Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, and the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, where explosive components of nuclear weapons were manufactured.. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life."
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was.This resulted in Innes Ireland failing to qualify despite being 13th fastest, and faster than Giorgio Scarlatti who did qualify..It was considered by some in the music industry to be the best sounding room in its time and others consider it to have been the greatest recording studio in history..The Euphoria World Tour was a concert tour by British hard rock band Def Leppard in support of their latest album Euphoria..The season also encompassed the Jim Clark Trophy and the Colin Chapman Trophy, which were respectively contested by drivers and constructors of Formula One cars powered by naturally aspirated engines.. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test."
"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination.The World Games sports comprise all the sports contested in The World Games..The organization contested the 1948 parliamentary election in the Palermo-Trapani-Agrigento-Caltanissetta constituency..Artistic gymnastics has been contested at the Summer Olympics since the first modern Olympic games in Athens..With high stakes testing impeding over every decision a teacher makes, they are often forced to teach to the tests rather than to their students.. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  "
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year.A graduate of Vermont College of Fine Arts, he has been a finalist for the Glimmer Train New Writers Award, the New Rivers Press American Fiction Prize, and the Carve Magazine Raymond Carver Short Story Contest..In addition, the vehicles were randomly inspected by the independent testing organization DEKRA..The Euroleague Basketball Next Generation Tournament, known as the Adidas Next Generation Tournament for sponsorship reasons, and until 2014, called the Nike International Junior Tournament (NIJT) for sponsorship reasons, is an international boy's youth age basketball tournament that is contested between the best basketball clubs in Europe in the Under-18 age category..He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches on twenty and eight occasions respectively, in an international career spanning nearly two decades.. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."
"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her.The Sett family temple and mansions are still there and stands testimony to the wealth and prosperity of the Setts..IMAC is the main governing body responsible for hosting precision aerobatic contests with hundreds of pilots across the United States and Eastern Canada..Fourteen candidates including two independents contested the five Indian seats..It was then sung with an older melody by Martin Luther, but a melody which was likely created by Johann Sebastian Bach for Georg Christian Schemelli's Musicalisches Gesang-Buch of 1736 is now part of current Protestant and Catholic hymnals..

"The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better.

The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself."
"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart.

Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her."
"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding.

Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph."
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese.

"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower.

The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved"
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test.

At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."
"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her.Her latest album, Friday Night (2016), featured Little Mike and the Tornadoes..20,000 fans are granted free entry and watch the two-day basketball tournament, including a slam dunk contest..The failure of these movements helped create conditions that ultimately led to the Protestant Reformation..Ignition tubes are used in the sodium fusion test.. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so.

The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.

"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.

"Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country.

So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back.

Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test."
"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again.Using bright-field microscopy, the SCD test appears to be more sensitive than the TUNEL assay..This is a list of consuls known to have held office, from the beginning of the Roman Republic to the latest use of the title in Imperial times, together with those magistrates of the Republic who were appointed in place of consuls, or who superseded consular authority for a limited period..The Nuclear Freeze campaign was a mass movement in the United States during the 1980s intended to place political pressure on the United States and the Soviet Union to mutually freeze the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons..Jamaica portal The United Theological College of the West Indies (UTCWI) is an ecumenical seminary training male and female clergy in Kingston, Jamaica, for Protestant denominations throughout the Caribbean.. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."

It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test."
"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story.Military logistics support and test equipment is also a large portion of their business, including machinery controls, logistics management systems, and automated test solutions for air, land and sea..It was released on October 4, 1996 in Germany and January 20, 1998 in the UK and United States as the first single from their self-titled debut album; it is also included on their 2005 compilation album, Greatest Hits..Articles include pieces on wealth inequality, the power of mass protest, the economic reasons behind Puerto Rico's crisis after Hurricane Maria and (sometimes critical) pieces on unions..Alphabeta were a group of Israeli singers who won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1978 with Izhar Cohen.. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."
" The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy.

The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it."
"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her.Founded in 2004, it is one of Britain's youngest, but fastest growing auction houses..Following one major protest that blockaded Delhi for a day, the Rajasthan High Court issued a notice of contempt against him for allegedly violating a previous order to keep the protests within lawful bounds..Under Humphrey III, Toron issued its own coinage, which did not survive the test of time..We Die,The Greatest Battle, From Corleone to Brooklyn, Black Demons and Mean Tricks.. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test.In 1955 there were contests in 16 of these..Conformal coating gives most of the benefits of potting, and is lighter and easier to inspect, test, and repair..Dutchman Soedjeman Dipowidjojo and Poland's Stefan Bidzinski both finished in 12.10 seconds, the third fastest time..He is best remembered for a superb solo play late in the third quarter of the 1993 AFL Grand Final where he collected the ball from the center bounce and within 10 seconds had goaled from 55 meters out, effectively killing the game as a contest.. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time.The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was an Australian political party that contested the 1943 federal election and the 1944 New South Wales state election..Since a self-test might detect that the system's usual human-readable display is non-functional, an indicator lamp or a speaker may be provided to show error codes as a sequence of flashes or beeps..Swimming was contested at the 1974 Asian Games in Aryamehr Swimming Pool, Tehran, Iran from September 2 to September 7, 1974..McKeldin Square has been designated as Baltimore's zone for protests, where it is legal to exercise one's First Amendment rights and pass out pamphlets.. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."
"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.It aired at 10:30AM, and aired against a test pattern on ABV-2, Lincoln Land (including Here's Humphrey) on GTV-9, and no programming on HSV-7..He recorded sessions for the John Peel show on BBC Radio 1 in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and made two television appearances on BBC Two's The Old Gray Whistle Test..Prisoners of Nazis burned in the ovens of the crematorium (sometimes to death), poisoned in gas chambers, tortured, raped, starved and forced to work at the same time to exhaustion; prisoners have bled for the soldiers of the Wehrmacht, was performed over them the terrible medical experiments, testing new drugs on the people..The large territory, they state, is not one of the greatest sources of strength of Russia, but one of its greatest weaknesses..- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."
"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up.Therefore, the Supreme Court held that the restrictive covenant could be contested in court again, even though some of the parties involved may have been included in the prior class of neighborhood landowner..Fencing events were contested at the 1963 Summer Universiade in Porto Alegre, Brazil..The 1966 Stanley Cup Finals was contested by the Detroit Red Wings and the defending champion Montreal Canadiens..The EU Contest was set up to promote the ideals of cooperation and interchange between young scientists.. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test.This is a list of estimates of the real gross domestic product growth rate (not rebased GDP) in Latin American and Caribbean states for the latest years recorded in the CIA World Factbook..The Tunisian naturalization issue was a protest movement against French and Tunisian laws that eased access to French citizenship in 1933, during the French protectorate of Tunisia..Half Pint's all-time greatest hit ""Greetings"" was released on Powerhouse in 1986..Marshall, a middle-order batsman, made his Test debut against South Africa in December 2000.. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "
"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise.The law also had other detrimental effects, as these people would now be unable to give testimony in court for any reason other than a slave being brought up for a capital offense and would also enable courts to use other forms of corporal punishment other than death..Although the majority of the protests and protesters were peaceful, the threat of violence and criminal damage were used by police as a reason to detain, or ""kettle"", protesters as part of Operation Glencoe..He is considered to be one of the greatest fencing theorists of all time..In 1985 Olsen won the New Folk songwriting contest at the prestigious Kerrville (Texas) Folk Festival with her song for battered women, 'I'm Keeping This Life of Mine'Many acclaimed artists as Eric Bibb, Fairport Convention, Maddy Prior, Mary Coughlan and Mollie O'Brien have covered and recorded songs by Olsen.. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started.Water quality, specifically the amount and type of minerals in the local water supply as measured by the total suspended solids or TSS test and other mineral levels such as sodium level, has a big effect on how severe water spots can be, for example on an automobile or dishes..A record/playback tool for simulating multi-user scenarios as well as testing & debugging applicationsTouchToolkit is a free and open source software under GNU Library General Public License (LGPL)..Cambridge won by seven lengths and took their first victory in eleven years, in one of the fastest winning times in the history of the event..Back in Rome he provides Octavian with Mark Antony's final will and testament in which Antony states his affection for both Cleopatra and Egypt.. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself.

She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more.

Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending."

It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think."

She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.The test measures parameters such as riding time (seconds) or endurance..The protesters became violent and began smashing car windows, even attempting to overturn a police cruiser, and one Trump supporter suffered a bloody gash to the face from a protester..Independent politician Eileen M.

"
"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again.

"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test.

"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel.

She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."
"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide.

When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.The roll control/parachute system was tested at Mach 2.2..A shovel test pit (STP) is a standard method for Phase I of an archeological survey..Joanes Leizarraga, a Catholic priest who joined the Reformation, translated the New Testament into Basque (1571)..The album was a parody of stereo test and demonstration records, which were used by hi-fi enthusiasts to test the performance of their audio systems.."

"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time.

In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding.

This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge.

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1).

The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."
"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”.

This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."

That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ .The smartest CEOs will fuse engineering and invention to dominate the next decade..The South African Russell Endean became the first victim of this method in international cricket when he was dismissed in a 1957 Test match against England..The song was written by Minogue, Terry Ronald and LMC, and produced by Lee Monteverde for Minogue's fifth album Club Disco (2007) and was also used as the lead single for her greatest hits compilation The Hits & Beyond (2006)..By 1895, the 'Society for the Establishment and Promotion of Sunday Schools' had distributed 91,915 spelling books, 24,232 Testaments and 5,360 Bibles....and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."
"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet.Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.

"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs.

This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"

" In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again.

"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change.Legalize LA was an activist campaign promoting amnesty for illegal immigrants, propagated through billboards, protests, clothing, advertisements, educational pamphlets, and grass roots support, underwritten by American Apparel..The 1999-00 Azerbaijan Top League was contested by twelve clubs and won by FK Shamkir..A Collection of Hits is the first greatest hits album released by Canadian country music singer Aaron Pritchett..In 1993 the DOSB opened an international office called Ausland which allows non-Germans to organize, participate and obtain the DSA outside Germany, but only under supervision of an authorized Verein (sport organization) and authorized Pruefer (judge); the decoration can be awarded to any person participating in the test..

Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up."
" The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her.In 2004, ""I Saw Her Standing There"" was ranked No. 139 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time..The theater earned its reputation for becoming the cultural center of the city of Fort Pierce as well as being the greatest and biggest cultural institution in Florida at the time..Later it aired at 2:30PM, with regular features also including ""Children's Doctor"" with Margaret Mackay and piano contest..Women with hyperthecosis often have more markedly elevated testosterone, more hirsutism, and are much more likely to be virilized..

She won’t spend so much time dreaming about her past.Simon Nye (born 29 July 1958 in Burgess Hill, Sussex) is an English comic television writer, best known for creating the hit sitcom Men Behaving Badly, writing all of the four ITV Pantos, co-writing the 2006 film Flushed Away, co-writing Reggie Perrin and creating the latest adaption of the Just William in the same-name CBBC series of 2010..He mad a formidable partnership with Welsh Center Jamie Roberts on the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa, playing in the opening two tests of the test series..Family E is a textual group of the New Testament manuscripts..The song was also featured on their greatest hits: Greatest Hits (2008 Ace of Base album).. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life."

That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   "
"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) confirmed that the latest Bangalore blast was a terror attack..In the century and a half of the cemetery's existence, Anglican, Protestant, Orthodox, and Jews, who died in Madrid have been buried there..As the number of possible tests for even simple software components is practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources..Parallel constraint satisfaction processes (PCSP) is a model that integrates the fastest growing research areas in the study of the mind; Connectionism, neural networks, and parallel distributed processing models.. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."

It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom"
" In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on.He has been appointed Chair in Language Testing at VU University Amsterdam, supervising research in the area of language testing & language proficiency modeling..Its main purpose is twofold: to promote the entry into force of the CTBT, which bans all nuclear explosions, and to establish a global verification regime to ensure that all nuclear tests are detected..The piece consists, mainly, of material Shostakovich had originally written in 1943 as an entry in a contest to compose a new national anthem for the U.S.S.R...He is Professor of Old Testament and Ancient Near Eastern History and Archeology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again.However, he was not allowed to participate after an EKG test administered by the Buccaneers showed he had an irregular heartbeat..The song polled at number 71 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 1997 countdown..An unpublished military diploma attests that he was governor of Roman Arabia on 12 August 145; Severianus was promoted to suffect consul in 147, with first Tiberius Licinius Cassius Cassianus then Gaius Popilius Carus Pedo as his colleague..NTU, like their first entry in 2003, held an internal selection for the Ukrainian entry for the 2004 contest.. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "
"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.

Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."
" I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts.Anita Traversi (25 July 1937 - 25 September 1991) was a Swiss singer, best known for her participation in the Eurovision Song Contests of 1960 and 1964..Incumbent George E.

"The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader.

 because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place
" The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time.Urine testing may be considered in those with a fever..Exactly what was given, and whether everyone on the list gave it are still matters of some scholarly dispute, and in some cases, what were originally seen as strong testimonies or confessions were admitted as fabricated in later years..This includes the forming of contingency plans, and organizing training events for the Metropolitan Police to test their CBRN response..During World War I the major political parties observed an electoral truce and most elections were uncontested with the incumbent party nominating a successor who was returned unopposed..

In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right."
 I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up
"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country.On February 10, 2016, the South Korean Ministry of Unification announced that the industrial park would be ""temporarily"" closed down and all staff recalled, partly in protest over continued North Korean provocations, including a satellite launch and a claimed hydrogen bomb test in January 2016..It is notable for being the shortest concert of the tour, because it was a television performance..Its nickname anaconda was ""invented"" during the flight test and referred to both the elongated body shape as well as the relatively critical flight characteristics of the machine..It won year-end accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies, making it one of the most awarded games in history, and is considered one of the greatest video games of all time..

"“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows.Amran did not recontest the seat in the 2013 election..The party contested three First Past the Post constituencies in 2008 Constituent Assembly election..Dissolved organic carbon in marine and freshwater systems is one of the greatest cycled reservoirs of organic matter on Earth, accounting for the same amount of carbon as the atmosphere and up to 20% of all organic carbon..When consumed, the larvae can survive in the intestine, causing enteric myiasis..

Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment.The Reverend Neil Mackinnon was the first Protestant minister on the island of Skye, being for many years in the 17th century the Episcopalian minister of first Strath and subsequently Sleat..It was located at 619 Hibiscus Street and on May 10, 1984, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places..The Eurovision Song Contest 1994 was the second time that Estonia had attempted to enter the contest, having failed to qualify from the semi-final stage of the Eurovision Song Contest 1993..We Know is Rancid's shortest studio album; at under 33 minutes, it is a-minute-and-a-half shorter than their 1993 self-titled debut album.. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her.

"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland.

While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter."

"The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste.The 1932 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Richmond Football Club and Carlton Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 1 October 1932..The Tour of Tasmania is a cycling road race contested annually in Tasmania, Australia..It is loosely based on real life events of Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Polenta..Baillie-Hamilton delayed the upcoming general election until May 1855 because he felt that a winter election would be unfair to Protestant voters living in remote areas of the colony..

"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding.

This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  "

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test.

She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’.

"In the story, “winter hibiscus”, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds he so much of her home.

" The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad.

"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud.Had Moldova sent Denis to Junior Eurovision, his entry would have been the song ""Spune Mi Ceva (Chemistry)"", but since any possible Junior Eurovision participation were not confirmed by TRM, Moldova withdrew from the contest, and Denis Midone did not return..Walter Brueggemann (born March 11, 1933) is an American Protestant Old Testament scholar and theologian who is widely considered one of the most influential Old Testament scholars of the last several decades..Instead, TRT decided to send Sertab Erener to Riga to represent Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest 2003..The tests are computer-based and consist of practical medical and surgical questions.. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.     "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test.Written by Allen and Mickey Rose, the film is about a bumbling New Yorker who, after being dumped by his activist girlfriend, travels to a tiny Latin American nation and becomes involved in its latest rebellion..The trio is one of Mendelssohn's most popular chamber works and is recognized as one of his greatest along with his Octet, Op..He appeared in four further Youth Tests, as well as two Youth One-Day Internationals, against New Zealand..Basketball event was contested for men only at the 1989 Summer Universiade in Duisburg, West Germany.. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph"
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs.Bassist, Kyle Johnson said ""It was the first song we recorded for the new album and it's a different song for us, it's little angrier, faster and actually the shortest song clocking in at a little over two minutes."".However the overhead of testing has prevented many designs from coming to market..Skehan is widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time..Anthonomus testaceosquamosus is a species of true weevil in the family of beetles known as Curculionidae.. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying.The Belaga seat was not contested by SNAP..His latest album, Jaded, also on PTO, was released in June 2014..As the results of tests became more important to students (gatekeepers to future prospects), teachers (evaluation), schools (funding), and states (lawsuits), test preparation as a function of teaching became essential..Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes."
" I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.Nahum 3 is the third and last chapter of the Book of Nahum in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible..The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel is one of the lost books of the Old Testament..Internationally, R-GT cars compete in the FIA R-GT Cup, which is contested on tarmac rounds of the ERC and WRC..He made his Test cricket debut for South Africa against Zimbabwe in August 2014.."
"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that.All files saved in Polaris Office are synchronized with other connected devices, and thus documents are automatically updated to the latest version..The exterior, the large antique loom (1830) and the interior, are testimony of the once flourishing textile industry (and trade) around Leiden, in particular during the 16th and 17th century, when many home weavers supplied the draper's guild with high quality woolen cloth..Connie Fisher (born 17 June 1983) is a British actress, singer and tv presenter, who won the BBC One talent contest, How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?.Although the Netherlands had won the contest in 1959, the Netherlands Television Foundation declined to host another contest so soon after staging the event in 1958.. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things."

The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace."
"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother.It is a dramatic, psychological, black-humored satire on corruption in high office, telling the story of a top police officer who kills his mistress, and then tests whether the police would charge him for this crime..Compered by Desmond Tester, it was a children's series..Members of the association are professional translators and/or professional interpreters, and have either passed an admission exam attesting to their translating and/or interpreting skills or have transferred their membership from another CTTIC affiliate..Flamboro Downs is Canada's fastest half-mile harness horse racing track, based in Hamilton (Flamborough), Ontario since April, 1975.. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.The Asian Men's Volleyball Championship is an international volleyball competition in Asia and Oceania contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of Asian Volleyball Confederation (AVC), the sport's continent governing body..As the center of political activity in New Zealand, Molesworth Street has been the site of many important events in New Zealand's history, including a large number of political protests..Ostella finished the championship 9th overall, accruing 287 points after contesting 13 of the 14 rounds..His name is only attested on the Abydos King List (n. 49)..” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."

She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2."
"  The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined.He played at representative level for Yorkshire, and at club level for Castleford, and Dewsbury (World War II guest), as a second-row, i.e. number 11 or 12, during the era of contested scrums..The list features fastest growing global companies based on the compound annual growth rate of revenues from 2013 to 2016..It was the first by-election to be held in Ireland after the Easter rebellion, and the rebellion had had no discernible impact on the contest..Samarasinghe is the 108th Sri Lanka Test Cap, where he debut against West Indies at Port of Spain West Indies in 2007/08.. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up."
"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time.The compound provided significant protection from cocaine overdose in rats only at the lowest dose tested in the measurement series..Muribaculum intestinale is a strictly anaerobic bacterium from the genus of Muribaculum which has been isolated from the caecal content of a mouse in Zurich in Switzerland..His latest album Spaceman Reloaded is available for pre-order on iTunes and will be releasing March 31, 2015 through Kobalt music/futuremgmt..Contested over 500 laps, the race was the 32nd of the 36-race 2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series season, and the sixth race in the 2004 Chase for the Nextel Cup..

Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."

That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese.

She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1.Prior to the twelfth season, Fresh Meat, contestants had only been from The Real World and Road Rules..However, the term has been resurrected in recent years to describe a form of acquired hyperinsulinism with beta cell hyperplasia found in adults, especially after gastrointestinal surgery..Camarillo was known for its ramp and flatland riders who seemed to be in just about every issue of BMX Plus and FREESTYLIN doing bike tests..This testimony revealed the existence of a unit in the Security Police called STRATCOM that specialized in misinformation and propaganda against opponents of the regime..

She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."

It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on."
"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea.The stomach is the organ most commonly affected, followed by the small intestine and the colon..Among the players who represented the club were C.

So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.One match on the undercard was contested for the TNA X Division Championship, in which Petey Williams successfully defended it against A.J.

"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed.Intended as a form of ""pilot program"" to test whether region-specific versions for the remaining 49 states were financially viable, the game was released in celebration of North Dakota's centennial celebration, and was aimed at schools to help teach children about the state's history and geography..On the night of June 23, 1969, the house suffered fire damage when a street flare was taken from a nearby road construction project and thrown through a first floor window; Charleston was experiencing widespread civil unrest at the time with racial protests occurring at several locations and several reports of vandalism..Although most of Ireland was Catholic, in the province of Ulster, Protestants were the majority..C. tetani spores are extremely hardy and can be found globally in soil or in the gastrointestinal tract of animals..

" The author concludes the story with this paragraph.

She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did."
"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles.

The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   "
" I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.This latest installment in the Chronicles of Everness includes new mythologies: that of the oldtime radio program, ""The Shadow,"" and the three dark gods: Fate, Death, and War..Before Sri Lanka became a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test and One Day International (ODI) status on 21 July 1981, Sri Lanka had associate member status from 1965 to 1981..The film is critical of the Sussex Police, arguing that they colluded with the company to intimidate protesters and bolster the case for a High Court harassment injunction..Their best known work was ""Stone Fox Chase"", which was used as the theme to the British Broadcasting Corporation's music program The Old Gray Whistle Test..  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time."
"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself.Heavyweight Championship, is the top title contested for the independent professional wrestling promotion World League Wrestling..Test film for another series, Doc Potts or Doc Potts and Weselly, was prepared in 1960, though the series was apparently never produced..Tiamat was also named as one of the greatest villains in D&D history in Dragon #359, the magazine's final print issue..Jammit allowed contestants to play a note for note cover or create their own rendition for the Pantera song ""Drag the Waters"", where Stephen performed the latter.. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story."
"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph.On 12 April 1994, Kamuhanda gave the orders to the Interahamwe militias the police to commence the killing of Tutsis who had taken refuge in a Protestant church's school in Gikomero..As of 2015, Brad Rutter is the highest-earning American game show contestant of all time, having accumulated a total of $4,555,102..Favorite Jeremy Wotherspoon fell in the first heat, taking him out of contention, but posted the fastest time in the second heat..At the state and national levels, the top teams can be separated by mere points (out of 750 total contest points).. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time."
"In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers.A city map is a large-scale thematic map of a city (or part of a city) created to enable the fastest possible orientation in an urban space..Greatest Hits is the first compilation of Spanish singer Marta Sanchez..The Mundialito de Clubes (Club World Cup in English) is a biennial (annual until 2013) international club beach soccer competition contested between top men's clubs from across the world..Balachandran contested the 1994 parliamentary election as one of the Democratic People's Liberation Front's candidates in Vanni District and was elected to Parliament.. At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."
" I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.In July 2003, she attested to the Coalition Provisional Authority that she had been tortured during her time in the prison, due to her religious beliefs..The album was released on April 7, 2015 on the AcidTest label..He first contested Epsom in 1964..The Judas Testament is a 1994 novel by Daniel Easterman.."
"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond.Vanderbilt sold the ship to his competitor, the New Jersey Steamship Navigation and Transportation Company, in December 1838 for $60,000, at which time the Lexington was reputedly the fastest steamer on Long Island Sound..The latest iteration of the ICCC is ICD-O-3/WHO 2008, which was updated to reflect hematopoietic codes..Developed as one of three ""Glomb"" aircraft, the inherent limitations of the Glomb and the technology of the time, combined with difficulties encountered in testing of the prototype, led to the production contract for the LBP-1 being reduced, then canceled, with none of the Glomb aircraft ever seeing operational service..Official budget documents refer to the latest generation of Electro-Optical satellites as Evolved Enhanced CRYSTAL System.. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."
 I think they think it will bring them luck
"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming.It was written by Claire Watts and Illustrated by Lisa Swerling & Ralph Lazar and won a US Parents' Choice Award in June 2009.The fifth title in the series, ""The Greatest Intergalactic Guide to Space Ever...by The Brainwaves"" was published in November 2009..Alabama won the Pasadena contest, 24-0..In 2011 JMET was discontinued and replaced by Common Admission Test (CAT)..Kenaf [etymology: Persian], Hibiscus cannabinus, is a plant in the Malvaceae family also called Deccan hemp and Java jute..

This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1.At times Celer also included the nomen ""Arruntius"" in his name, indicating either that his mother belonged to that family, or he received a legacy from someone of that family in return for adopting that person's name, a practice referred to by scholars as ""testamentary adoption""..Free is the fifth studio album by Israeli singer Dana International, released in 1999, the year after she won the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 with the song ""Diva""; it includes an alternative version of the track..The constituency's sole MP, George Ngumi, contested the Gizo/Kolombangara seat in the 1976 elections, but was defeated by Lawry Eddie Wickham..The men's handball tournament at the 1992 Summer Olympics was contested by twelve teams divided in two groups, with the top two proceeding to the semifinals and the bottom four proceeding to placement matches.. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph."
"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it.The 1992 season saw 117 units marching across the Novice, Contest, Championship and Premier Classes..As a result, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is considered a medical emergency and typically requires hospital care for urgent diagnosis and treatment..These renovations are expected to be completed by 2020.The arena has been hailed by sportscasters and opponent coaches alike as one of the greatest venues in college basketball..New Zealand batsman Brendon McCullum became the first man to score a Test century at Hagley Oval when he made 196 against Sri Lanka in inaugural match in 2014..

When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test.The next day, gunmen shot dead ten Ulster Protestant civilians in the Kingsmill massacre..Metal testing is a process or procedure used to check composition of an unknown metallic substance..The World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest has become one of the most popular barbecue contests in the country and is celebrating its 41st year in 2018..Considered one of the greatest batsmen in limited-overs cricket, also regarded as the best T20 batsman ever.. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times.At the 1920 Summer Olympics, ten wrestling events were contested, for all men..The audition for new contestants was opened in 2018..In the third week of September Down played Cork in what was deemed a 'David vs. Goliath' contest in that Cork had played in numerous All-Ireland Finals over the previous years and many felt that it was their time to lift the Sam Maguire..The album, featuring a DVD containing the latest music videos, was released on September 13, 2008.. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring.Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) or Marcus Gunn pupil is a medical sign observed during the swinging-flashlight test whereupon the patient's pupils constrict less (therefore appearing to dilate) when a bright light is swung from the unaffected eye to the affected eye..Knightdale's population grew 10.4% from 2010-2012, making it the second fastest-growing community in the Research Triangle region for that time period..The Anti-Gravity Treadmill can allow testing of weight bearing by lowering effective body weight in 1% increments from 100-20% of body weight..These were the first national elections contested by the SLD, which had just been formed as a merger of the SDP and Liberals after several years of the alliance.."
"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it.It was ranked number 426 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of ""the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time""..The tournament was contested between Scotland, Ireland and Wales..In the first copies in DVD format with a black cover, the fans were treated Dilema (Music Video), video testimonials by Cherry Belle, Dilemma making, video live performance Cherry Belle, and Dilema (dance version)..Her greatest achievement was the fifth place at the 1980 Summer Olympics, jumping 1.91 meters.. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means."
" The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well.Greatest Hits is the first studio album by Canadian rock band Rheostatics..The 1993 Ms. Olympia contest was an IFBB professional bodybuilding competition was held on November 27, 1993, at the Beacon Theater in New York City, New York..Emasculation of a human male is the removal of both the penis and the testicles, the external male sex organs..Maria Abrahan (born November 6, 1985), also known as Gee-Ann Abrahan, is a Filipino actress and former reality show contestant.."
"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well.Protests continued daily and internationally through February 6..Uncial 0314 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament..She played a total of five Tests and 19 ODIs..In protest at a tour of South Africa by the All Blacks team early in the year, Congo's official Jean Claude Ganga led a boycott of 28 African nations as the International Olympic Committee refused to bar the New Zealand team.. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."
"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy.It conducts research, development, test, and evaluation of aerospace systems from concept to deployment..In 2001, Cook acted as a substitute fielder for England in a Test match against Pakistan at Lord's Cricket Ground as a substitute fielder in the absence of injured England captain Nasser Hussain..Contested over 113 laps, it was the second exhibition race of the 2016 Sprint Cup Series season..The songs were sung by popular ISS Contestants such as Najeem Arshad, Durga, Sannidanandan, Shikha, Vani, Yasin, Shwetha, Gayatri, Somdas, Pramod, Vivekanandan, Bitty and Sonia.. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring.His greatest success came in the ICC Trophy, where he had a fine all-round career..IMM is devoted to human genome research with the aim of contributing to a better understanding of disease mechanisms, developing novel predictive tests, improving diagnostics tools, and developing new therapeutic approaches..The remaining contestants where then split in 10 groups of 5 where the most vote getter would move on to the top 10..While in the latter, they must answer a series of eight questions to win a jackpot that grows progressively as contestants fail to answer all eight correctly.. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready."
"The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1.He has been actively participating in the Teachers politics since 1998 and has also contested the elections for the post of President of Government School Teachers Association, Delhi (GSTA)..The greatest number of votes ever cast in the voting precinct was 72 in 1900.Starting sometime before 1895, residents of Nine Mile Canyon struggled to keep a school district going..The MDF usually holds telephone exchange protective devices including heat coils, and functions as a test point between a line and the exchange equipment..Recently the Wire fans voted him 'Greatest Hooker' in Wire's history, beating John Thursfield, and Mark Roskell into 2nd and 3rd place.. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.A TANGO1 like protein called TALI is expressed in liver and intestine and shown to be required for the export of bulky very Low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons..Helene Hegarty (born 16 June 1931) is a former British cricket player who played seven test matches for the England women's cricket team between 1954 and 1963..The Goblin was the second British jet engine to fly, after the Power Jets W.1, and the first to pass a type test and receive a type certificate issued for an aircraft propulsion turbine..A total of 46 events were contested, 24 by male and 22 by female athletes..” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."
