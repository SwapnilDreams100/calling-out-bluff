"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings.uh.. erm The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life.By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was.She was able to make a connection with the plant.I mean ... erm The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.",3
"huh well.. The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home.It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her.Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh.To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past.Saeng says, “.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice.um Ahhh This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe.It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life.And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.",3
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives.like Ahhh Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home.The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test.hmm Ahhh The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well.With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle.",3
"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons.Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring.Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity.um um Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life.When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it.The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus.so.. Ahhh This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam",3
"um Ahhh The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion.That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country.Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home.like hmm Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone.The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel.""The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese.",3
