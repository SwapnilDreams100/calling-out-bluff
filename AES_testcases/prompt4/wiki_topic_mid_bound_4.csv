I feel as if she wasn’t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    "

The geese returning represents a new life as in coming back to something semi–new.He has also written many highly cited research papers in graph drawing, on topics including spring algorithms, maintenance of the ""mental map"" in dynamically changing drawings, heuristics for reducing the number of edge crossings in layered graph drawings, and visual display of clustering information in graphs..Citizens Project was also at the forefront of the reestablishment of a Human Relations Commission in Colorado Springs..The Los Angeles Handicap is an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually in April or in May at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California during the spring racing season (relocated in 2104 from Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California)..It is located near Hot Spring Canyon on the Ortega Highway (CA Route 74).. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The hibiscus is budding represents growth. The author will be older and more knolageble and more skilled than before."
 The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it.. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.

" The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don’t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life.Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band Greatest Hits is Bruce Springsteen's fifth compilation album, released as a limited edition first in the United States, Canada and Australia on January 13, 2009, exclusively through Wal-Mart retailers..The Cape Fear Thunder is a football team in the Women's Spring Football League (WSFL) based in Fayetteville, North Carolina..It differs in nature from spring growth which is fixed when leaves and shoots are laid down in the bud the previous year..Londrigan was born in Springfield..

Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up."
"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .The company marketed itself as a ""different kind of car company"" and operated somewhat independently from its parent company for a time with its own assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee; unique models; and a separate retailer network, and was GM's attempt to compete with Japanese automakers..Green Spring is an unincorporated community in northern Frederick County, Virginia, United States of America..Entomobrya sinelloides is a species of slender springtails in the family Entomobryidae..This article is about the ship that sank near the Apostle Islands, not to be confused with the other shipwreck of the same name at Spring Lake, Michigan..” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  "
"The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine.The women's 3 m springboard synchro competition of the diving events at the 2012 European Aquatics Championships was held on May 20..Based in the mountain town of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, Wing-Time sauces are shipped all over the country and exported to thousands of stores..Its specific name honors the American ichthyologist Victor G.

She is finally settling into her new life and says that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future."
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right.After the band released numerous platinum-selling albums throughout the 1990s, Welty left The Offspring in 2003 to form Steady Ground, claiming that he wanted to ""focus on [his] own thing""..Spring Brook is a town in Dunn County, Wisconsin, United States..Glenarm is located along Interstate 55, south of Springfield..KIBT (96.1 FM, 96.1 The Beat) is a Rhythmic Top 40 formatted radio station serving the Colorado Springs area as well as nearby Pueblo, Colorado.. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening.The Barn Aid benefit's aim was the restoration of the barn at Bubbling Springs Farm..The tannery is located in a residential area southeast of Woodbury Road, and east of Cold Spring Harbor Railroad Station..It consists of four Adventist theologians working at the church headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, and is currently (as of 2016) directed by Elias Brasil de Souza..The distinctive store structures on the broad Main Street, the noticeable contrast of house types and neighborhoods and the variety of religious institutions dominated by the foundry owner's donated Episcopal church, are the legacy of the prosperous and paternalistic society in nineteenth century Cold Spring.. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about."
"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly.She is the author of Beginning Functional Analysis, published in the Springer Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics series in 2001..The unincorporated community of Big Spring is located in the town..Recipients must agree to ""pass on the gift"" by sharing animal offspring, as well as the skills and knowledge of animal husbandry and agricultural training with other impoverished families..The flowers appear in spring and summer, in various colors from yellow to purple.. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.” @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."
"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior.Fe Uprising is a 1946 American Western film in the Red Ryder film series directed by R.

She said ‘’when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     "
"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life.Central High School is a high school located in uptown Springfield, Missouri..The mat species rise to the surface in early spring, grow rapidly through the summer, disappearing by late summer..Early cases were associated with recent travel to Mexico; many were students who had traveled to Mexico for Spring Break..Toto released in the spring of 1982 by Columbia Records.. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     "
"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more.It was established in June 1962, and is published by Springer in English, Dutch, French, German, or Russian, with summaries in English..In the first film, Gizmo's offspring rampaged through a small fictional town..It consists of just over 350 houses in three main housing estates (Barnard Avenue, Moor Crescent and Springfield Meadows) and a few smaller streets..It is located at the intersection between Waverley Rd and Springvale Rd.. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."
 I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden.. Without no friends just let in her mom
" The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is.The 10FP is designated a ""short action"" meaning cartridges similar in length to the .308 Winchester, while the 110FP is considered a ""long action"" meaning cartridges similar in length to the .30-06 Springfield..Its ""claim to fame"" is Mineral Springs, the largest natural sulfur spring in the world..Founded 1914, it was one of the Polish-American Roman Catholic parishes in New England in the Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts..Tranghese retired as commissioner in the spring of 2009.. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test."
"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring.. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life."
"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam.Also on the property are the contributing spring house, smokehouse, and a guest cottage, all constructed around 1834, and early-20th-century structures that include secondary dwellings, a dairy barn with attached silos and a corncrib, a milking parlor, five sheds, a garage, a pump house, and a cistern..It is located in the Ouachita Mountains southeast of Hot Springs, on Arkansas Highway 51 north of U.S. Highway 270..Previously run as an allowance race, the Beaumont was elevated to a stakes event for the 1986 spring meeting..In the fall of 2009, the PBR made their first Built Ford Tough Series appearance at the JQH Arena, and appeared again in the spring of 2010.. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become..The meat is eaten with spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings..In 1993, Horn contracted James Perry to kill his ex-wife, mentally challenged son, and the family's overnight nurse in their Silver Spring, Maryland, home..The Brentwood-Darlington Neighborhood Association dates to 1974 when it was founded as the Errol Heights Improvement Association, serving the neighborhoods of Errol Heights, Brentwood, Darlington, Harney Park, Woodmere, and Crystal Springs..Pownall was a British fortification built during the French and Indian War, whose remains are located at Fort Point State Park in Stockton Springs, Maine... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas."
 The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around..
" The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ’’Winter Hibiscus’’ with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over…’’ In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding… connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ’’take that test again…’’ By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ’’@CAPS1 of loss.Sir Dryden Thomas Spring DSc (Honoris Causa), DistFInstD (born 6 October 1939) of Tauranga, is a New Zealand businessman, who was Chairman of the New Zealand Dairy Board from 1989 to 1998 and Chairman of New Zealand Dairy Group from 1982 to 1987, Chairman Of ANZ New Zealand from 2007 to 2012..Gates was a founding board member for the Change Point Pregnancy Care Center in Hot Springs..The plant takes its common name ""wake-robin"" by analogy with the European robin, which has a red breast heralding spring..The show first toured in spring 1991, but its popularity led to a further tour in early 1992 and another in the autumn of that year..’’ and to her grief.

Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test."
"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test.It was started in 1843 as a celebration of spring, and a time when all of the townsfolk would get together and trade in sweet potato slips, used to grow the plants..White Oak is an unincorporated community located in the town of White Oak Springs, Lafayette County, Wisconsin, United States..It is a small shrub with fine, silky hairs covering the new foliage and heads of pink to deep purple flowers in early spring..In 2007 Bruce Springsteen covered it as part of his Seeger Sessions tour, releasing a live version of it as a bonus track on his Live in Dublin album..

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go.

It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle."
".The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it’s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng “cheep skip over live to you’re back she saw cheerfully” @CAPS1 it’s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to"

"Confidence, persistance, memories – all things that Saeng has “that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, “then I will take that test again,” shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time.

"The author of “Winter Hibiscus”chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life.

The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test.

With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle."

 The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring.. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.
"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”.. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."
"The story like this for mine reasons. First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two.The first experimental realization of exchange spring media was done on Co-PdSiO multilayers as the hard layer which was coupled via a PdSi interlayer to a FeSiO soft layer..Hutton has continued to model into her seventies, appearing in numerous advertising campaigns for H&M, Lord and Taylor, and Alexander Wang, and performed on the runway for Tom Ford's spring 2012 collection, as well as for Bottega Veneta at the 2016 New York Fashion Week..This is an annual star party held each autumn and spring in Kielder Forest..Springfield High School was the first public high school in Springfield, Oregon, United States.. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that."
"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months.The Watson family went on to build a number of houses in the Green Springs area..Springfield Road station is a SEPTA Route 101 trolley stop in Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania..Springfield Armory, Inc. is an American firearms manufacturer founded in 1974 by Bob Reese to rescue the famous name ""Springfield Armory"" and also the philosophy that drove the Springfield Armory for centuries..In 2015, Cary was named ""European Digital Leader of the Year"" by ICT Spring.. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     "
 So she did not forget to take the test again..
 Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter..
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden.

Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."
"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying.It is operated by PAR subsidiary Springfield Terminal Railway..Students are served by Peyton School District 23JT in the Peyton area and by Falcon School District 49 in the Falcon area and nearby areas of Colorado Springs..The town derives its name from a nearby spring..Springtown (formerly, Confederate Corners) is an unincorporated community in Monterey County, California, United States.. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past."
"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world.Musically gifted, the family moved to Altamonte Springs, Florida in 1974 and after just two months there, the sisters got to sing in public for the first time when they and their parents went to see Donald O'Connor perform at Disney World's Top Of The World dinner theater..In the Cup Championship match at the Harrington Memorial Pitch at Babson College in Wellesley, MA, Salve Regina University defeated Springfield College by a score of 53-21..Also a musical, it is a remake of the 1927 silent comedy Spring Fever..Wellspring completed fundraising on its fourth fund in 2005 with $1.0 billion of investor commitments as a successor to its $665 million 2003 Fund III.."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .This hotsprings is privately owned and visiting without owner permission is an actionable trespass..Max Weinberg (born April 13, 1951) is an American drummer and television personality, most widely known as the longtime drummer for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and as the bandleader for Conan O'Brien on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien..The Groovy Grails Company - was acquired by SpringSource in November 2008, and it was later acquired by VMware..Greenwell Springs is an area of Central, Louisiana, United States, a city in the Baton Rouge metropolitan area..When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”."
"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion.In October 2013, the State of Florida took over operations of Silver Springs Nature Theme Park and combined the property with the adjacent Silver River State Park to form Silver Springs State Park..It has been the most selective club on the street since 2013, with 227 students bickering in Spring 2015, forty-four percent of whom were offered membership..The building, which suffered significant damage in the 2011 Springfield tornado and has been restored, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015..Murray Springs is located in southern Arizona near the San Pedro River and once served as a Clovis hunting camp approximately 9000 years BCE.. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."
" The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city.Mudlavia Springs is an extinct town that was located in Liberty Township in Warren County, Indiana, west of the town of Kramer..Springfield Lake Colchester is a lake of Colchester County, in Nova Scotia, Canada..RCN also operates KFCS Colorado Springs, KVLE-FM Gunnison, and KSKE (AM) Buena Vista..He graduated from Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications and a Master of Arts degree in political communication from the University of Maryland, College Park..

"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .Spring Grove is an unincorporated community located in the town of Green Lake, Green Lake County, Wisconsin, United States..The village of Berrien Springs is the only incorporated municipality within the township..Richlands railway station is located on the Springfield line in Queensland, Australia..RFA Tidespring is a Tide-class replenishment tanker of the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA)..This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."
"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus.

And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once.. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1."
"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS.Blikk is a Hungarian daily tabloid newspaper published in Budapest, Hungary and owned by the German-Swiss media company, Ringier-Axel Springer..The Statement of 1000 was a statement by 1000 Syrian intellectuals in January 2001, during the Damascus Spring, following the earlier Statement of 99 made in September 2000..As of spring 2015, its product lines include its signature founding line of watches, and further lines of handbags, jewelry, and other durable personal goods..They were founded in 1930, but folded following the spring 1932 season..

"" ""I’d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way.

Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way."
"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life.

She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."
"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will.HSBC Arena, Buffalo, NY, 11/22/09 is a live album by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, released in November 2016..It also entered into competition with other schools of the parish in rallies, the first of which was held in Donaldsonville in the spring of 1908..In 2012 she was selected to represent Great Britain in the 2012 London Olympics in the Women's synchronized 3 meter springboard event..Located in the district and listed separately are the Barclay House, Espy House, Russell House, and Chalybeate Springs Hotel.. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again.Set in Rome and Imperial Spain during the spring and summer of AD 73, the novel stars Marcus Didius Falco, informer and imperial agent..The Town of Wilton is in the northeastern part of the county, northeast of Saratoga Springs, which it borders..He probably died without living offspring, as he was succeeded as Duke of Burgundy by Gilbert of Chalon, who held the title of Duke of Burgundy jure uxoris, his wife Ermengard being the daughter of Richard of Autun, and sister of Hugh..McDonald's Premium line is a group of products introduced by McDonald's in the spring of 2003.. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."
" I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive.Foos developed his own improved version of Sintz's engine and established the Foos Gas Engine Company in 1887 in Springfield, Ohio..The Spring Garden, near the Spanish River, was one of the earliest sugar plantations in Jamaica..They show direct development and maternal care of a small number of offspring, in contrast to marine crabs which release thousands of planktonic larvae..It was formed in Berkeley, California in the spring of 1965 by activist Jerry Rubin, and was active through the majority of the Vietnam war, organizing several rallies and marches in California as well as coordinating and sponsoring nationwide protests.. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life."
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was.We, the Weapon was recorded between Toronto, Ontario and Halifax, Nova Scotia at Halla Music, Greendoor Studios, Sunnyside Studios, The Echo Chamber and Studio 313 in the Spring of 2009 and was mastered by Noah Mintz at the Lacquer Channel in Toronto..Other unrecognized fraternities from SUNY Oneonta shown in the film include Sigma Alpha Mu, also known as ""Sammy"", and Tau Kappa Epsilon, which was recognized in the spring of 2007 but shortly thereafter lost their recognition from the campus..She remained berthed at Green Cove Springs until transferred to the Maritime Administration in March 1961, and berthed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia, where she remained until 1970..It is published by Springer Science+Business Media and affiliated with the Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology (Academia Sinica, Taiwan).. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test."
"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination.The transition section from Paynes Landing to Orange Springs consists of flooded standing timber and areas of floating vegetation..The 1911 Spring Hill Badgers football team represented the Spring Hill College during the 1911 college football season..It produces small flowers surrounded by white involucral gland appendages from spring to fall..He is the brother of Maso Bowles who played for the Springbok under 21 side in the 2000 u/21 SANZAR series in which John Smit captained the side to victory in the series.. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  "
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year.Its source is in springs in the Edwards Plateau in northwest Bandera County, Texas and merges with the San Antonio River in southern Bexar County, Texas, for a course of 120 miles..The productions has been in a variety of venues including: the Austrian Embassy in D.C., the French Embassy in Georgetown, the German Embassy in D.C., and their current home the Randolph Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland..Played in mid-winter in the Coachella Valley (greater Palm Springs), it is part of the tour's early season ""West Coast Swing."".Elkhead is part of the Springfield, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area.. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."
"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her.Fuji Food Products is a food manufacturer based in Santa Fe Springs, California, United States, that specializes in ready-to-eat sushi products for supermarkets in the United States..The cemetery is called by several names, including Old Montefiore, Springfield, or less commonly, just Montefiore..Paulding County is included in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area..The Seattle affiliate of Major League Rugby, the Seattle Seawolves will play at Starfire Sports beginning in Spring 2018..

"
"The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school.Simpson-Poplar Springs African Methodist Episcopal Church, is a historic African Methodist Episcopal Church located at 16901 Hardy Road in Mt Airy, Maryland..His district is based in Colorado Springs..He also coached the Springboks between 1997 and 2000 and was the head coach of Italy's rugby union team between 2007 and 2011..The band makes appearances at pep rallies, special occasions, and formerly in the annual spring VEISHEA celebration parade.. For example she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.” This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation."
"I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn’t melt in the spring geese don’t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either.. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    "
 When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring..

When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again."
" The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng.An ancient sacred spring or holy well existed near to the modern-day Carlton Road and became associated with St Helen in early Christian times..Via the aquifer and numerous springs, they are tributaries of the Snake River..Springbrook is a town in Washburn County, Wisconsin, United States..It grow up to 5 meters high and has orange to red flowers which appear from spring to autumn.. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home.

That make her sad. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story. It shows her getting used to the new home"

It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. "
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same.. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph."
" In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”. But I know this because its says “Then I will take that test again” her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant.Haig commanded the BEF in the defeat of the German Army's Spring Offensives, the Allied victory at Amiens in August, and the Hundred Days Offensive, which led to the war-ending armistice in November 1918..The latest LP, ""Coyote in the Graveyard,"" comes out in Spring, 2018..Dead Reckoning was a 1990 television film, directed by Robert Michael Lewis, starring Cliff Robertson, Rick Springfield, and Susan Blakely..He spent most of the 2004 spring training with the Twins before they returned him to Seattle..

"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng.

Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng."
"The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles.. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time."

"The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring.Many of the coaches would be removed from their stations in the winter and overhauled at the railway's workshops ready to be returned in the spring, being placed on sidings..Chionodoxa siehei or Siehe's glory-of-the-snow is a bulbous perennial from west Turkey flowering in early spring..Adults are Honey Bee mimics and can be found in spring visiting hawthorn flowers..The village is part of the Springfield, Ohio Metropolitan Statistical Area..

"The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing.. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again."
 The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself.. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself.
"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test.Austin P.

If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her."
"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable.A Fahnestock clip is an early type of spring clamp electrical terminal for connections to bare wires..Songs included ""I Wonder,"" ""My Peaches and Cream,"" ""Oh You Beautiful Spring"", ""The Ragtime Restaurant"" and ""Since the Days of Grandmamma""..Four of the railroad's directors were from New York City, one was from Springfield, Illinois..Flowers include common violets and enchanter's nightshade, and there are displays of bluebells in the spring..

When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph."
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it.Archer is located on the Sangamon Valley Trail on the western border of Springfield..Monteagle County was named in honor of Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon (1790-1866), a former Chancellor of the Exchequer..Springloops offers two kinds of paid plans: Personal, with 3-6GB of disk space and 10-25 repositories, and Business, with 12-60GB of space and 50 to unlimited repositories and a range of extra features..They began in 1986 when the Redwood Pioneers relocated to Palm Springs and they relocated to Lake Elsinore, California after the 1993 season and became the Lake Elsinore Storm..

 She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it..
 They author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want to see what people would say..
"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower.

The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way."
"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination.

The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved"
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope.After a stint in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, Lysak attended Springfield College and worked as a painting contractor until the age of 62..Edith Burroughs (born 1939) was a pro-bowler who was born in Union Springs, Alabama..In 1980 she became AIAW diving champion in springboard, and in 1982 she won the AIAW team championship with the Texas Longhorns..Spring Lake Park School District 16 is a Minnesota school district serving 5,500 students from the cities of Blaine, Spring Lake Park, and Fridley.. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."
"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her.The user presses the two handles together, causing the jaws to open against the force of the spring, then inserts a stack of papers and releases the handles..The Ashland Springs Hotel is a historic hotel in Ashland, Oregon, United States..The album features brand new tracks along with covers of Bruce Springsteen and The Killers..For unknown reasons, the album, originally due out in the spring, had been repeatedly delayed by the label.. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  "
"The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she’ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.."

 The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow.. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.
"All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country.The community is located south of Springfield on West Virginia Route 28 at Hanging Rocks along the South Branch Potomac River..In 1973 he finished second three times in spring before winning the Irish Derby at odds of 33/1..The Springfield CDP is recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau with a population of 30,484 as of the 2010 census..Once complete, the trail will be 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet (4.3 m) wide and traverse the cities of Atlanta, Sandy Springs and Dunwoody..

In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence."

"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.

"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back.

Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."
 The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job..

Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test."
"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again.

It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again.The second edition was published between 2002-2003 by Axel Springer Poland as an attempt to restore the title..Small fumaroles can be seen on the northern and southern slopes, and hot springs are found at the north-eastern base of the volcano, as well as along rivers on south-eastern side..It is stimulated to grow in the spring when the thaw begins to increase moisture in the environment..This may result in the expression of recessive traits in the offspring.. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."
 the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope.. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.
"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story.It was later included on the compilation album The Essential Bruce Springsteen..Indian Springs is a census-designated place (CDP) in Polk County, Texas, United States..The device, invented by Sam S.

By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."
" The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved.It was the home of Springfield businessman and local politician, George Sale Day..The film is a co-production of Spring Films and MJM Productions and was distributed to theaters nationwide on September 2, 2009 by Solar Films and Star Cinema..In writing the novel Heinlein drew on his experience of building a fallout shelter under his own house in Colorado Springs, Colorado in the 1960s..Some contestants for the inaugural tournament were selected through contestant searches held in Daytona Beach, Florida, and Palm Springs, California, during the Spring break season in 1989.. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test."

Marshall in attendance.. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is."
"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .It covers the Brisbane CBD, as well as the suburbs of Kelvin Grove, Herston, Bowen Hills, Newstead, Teneriffe, Fortitude Valley, Spring Hill, Petrie Terrace and New Farm..Hot Spring Canyon is a drainage located in the Santa Ana Mountains of Southern California..Spring was founded as ""Concord"" on November 6, 1849, then was renamed ""Ohio"" in April, 1851, and finally ""Spring"" in October, 1851..It is the location of (or is the nearest community to) Springfield to Fayetteville Road-Brightwater Segment, which is located at N Old Wire Rd./Benton Cty Rd..” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it."
"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her.2014's High Hopes was Springsteen's eleventh #1 album placing him at third all-time for most #1 albums ever trailing only Jay-Z (13) and The Beatles (19)..Notable properties include the Old Stone Hotel, Episcopal Chapel, Stone Store Building (1820), Stone Bath House (1820), Stone Spring House (c. 1820), Sweet Sulfur Springs Site (discovered 1802), Salt Sulfur Spring (discovered 1805), and Iodine Spring (1838)..Weldon Springs is a spring at the town of Weldon Spring, in the U.S. state of Missouri..Unlike the Ontario version, Sockey is most commonly played on outdoor hockey rinks in Fall and Spring using a soccer ball, designating specific board panels as ""nets"" and full body contact is permitted.. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test.In the lower part of its course, it flows through the city of Springfield, bordering Springfield's Oak Ridge Cemetery and the tomb of Abraham Lincoln..It produces orange flowers between September and October (spring) in the species native range..Founded in 1960, it mainly serves the cities of Whittier, Pico Rivera, Santa Fe Springs, El Monte, and South El Monte..Featuring production by Legends then-manager, Kanye West, as well as Dave Tozer, will.i.am, and Devo Springsteen.. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time.Key corporate shareholders of the company include National University of Singapore Technology Holdings, SPRING Singapore and WhiteRock Medical Company..The Cold Spring Presbyterian Church, located on Seashore Road in the Cold Spring section of Cape May, in Cape May County, New Jersey, United States, is a historic two-story church on the National Register of Historic Places..Steamboat Rock is a rock formation in the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, Colorado..The league runs from spring until October.. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."
"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.The latter is Editor-in-Chief of the associated Archives and Museum Informatics journal published by Springer..It is eligible under Criterion A for its association with mineral spring resorts and their popularity as a source of healing and recreation..In 1977, he founded health care supplies distributor Best Medical International in Springfield, Virginia..Since May 2014, the newly electrified track between Springburn and Cumbernauld has become an extension of the North Clyde network..- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."
"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up.He is a civil rights activist and the president of the Greater Springfield NAACP..Brilliant Pool is a hot spring in the Upper Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park in the United States..The Women's 3 m springboard competition of the 2014 European Aquatics Championships was held on 24 August..The mine uses the Shear-pin based Contact Mine Fuze No.3 Mk I. The fuze consists simply of a spring-loaded striker pin restrained by a shear pin.. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test.He also called select Mets games during both spring training and the regular season during that time..Aspen Springs is a census-designated place in Mono County, California..In 2000, Barry made his Springbok debut against Canada in East London..They occurred on the goldfields at Spring Creek, Stoney Creek, Back Creek, Wombat, Blackguard Gully, Tipperary Gully, and Lambing Flat.. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "
"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise.It is located at the intersection of Route 13 and Route 215 about fifteen miles north of Springfield..It was based on the novel Fame Is the Spur by Howard Spring..Day House is a historic home located at Springfield, Greene County, Missouri..Wagon Wheels Westward is a 1945 American Western film in the Red Ryder film series directed by R. G. Springsteen and written by Earle Snell.. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started.. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself.

When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home.He placed 22nd at the 1994 World Junior Championships in Colorado Springs, Colorado..Since a redistribution in 2013, it has covered an area of 79.25 square kilometers and includes the localities of Berkeley, Coachwood Park, Coniston, Cordeaux Heights, Corrimal, Cringila, Fairy Meadow, Farmborough Chase, Farmborough Heights, Figtree, Gwynneville, Kembla Grange, Kembla Heights, Kemblawarra, Lake Heights, Lindsay Heights, Mangerton, Mount Kembla, Mount Saint Thomas, North Wollongong, Port Kembla, Primbee, Spring Hill, Towradgi, Unanderra, Warrawong, West Wollongong, Windang, Wollongong..The first event held at the Speedway was the 1969 NHRA Spring Nationals..Fen grassland has flora such as grass of parnassus and bog pimpernel, there are southern marsh orchid and marsh pennywort in marsh grassland, and spring-fed tall fen has lesser water parsnip..

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again. “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.Sadadeen is a suburb of the town of Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, Australia..Desert Springs is a suburb of the town of Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, Australia..The Offspring were formed in 1983 under the name Manic Subsidal by singer/guitarist Dexter Holland and bassist Greg K., who later recruited Noodles as their guitarist..RGS Springfield (Royal Grammar School Springfield) is a co-ed Junior School of RGS Worcester..” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  "
"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again.

 I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story..The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her.Union Maj. Gen. William T.

Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test."
" The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself .

Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding."

By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality."
" I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home.The women's 1 meter springboard was part of the Diving at the 2018 Commonwealth Games program..Founded in 1939, it has expanded to include offices in Alexandria, Virginia, Colorado Springs, Colorado, Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma..In character as Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, the pair put their own interpretation on popular songs including ""I Love Paris"" and ""Paris in the Spring."".The next Culturefest is slated for Spring 2020.. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  "
"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her.The school is a part of the Palm Springs Unified School District..Its new studios and offices along with its transmitter are located on Troy Road (State Route 41) in Springfield, almost directly across the highway from its original location a mile northwest of the Upper Valley Mall..It was named in 1918 by Arthur O.

She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages"

Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story."
"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end.The Springfield Sting is a franchise in the American Basketball Association playing in the Northeast Division..Microaerobacter geothermali has been isolated from a hot spring from Hammam Sidi in Tunisia..It was later included on the compilation album The Essential Bruce Springsteen..The station in White Sulfur Springs still stands after being restored for the movie Heartland in 1982..

For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again."
 The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng.. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it.

She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."
"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then.The Grove, also known as Loretto Rest, is a historic house located on Grove Court in Cold Spring, New York, United States..He returned permanently in the spring of 2008 as the assistant attending physician..McFarland Peak is a limestone peak in the northern portion of the Spring Mountains in Clark County of southern Nevada..The league again postponed their launch each successive year, with the final postponement taking place in February 2010; despite that postponement it was stated that the league's first game would take place in spring 2011.. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things."
"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity.A Linerlock is a folding knife with a side-spring lock that can be opened and closed with one hand without repositioning the knife in the hand..On Main Street, the border is roughly demarcated by the western property line of the Baptist Church at the height of land, and by the property line along the rear of the church lot, extending south toward the Cold Spring Cemetery..Briscoe Springs as a community didn't develop till after the state paved a six-mile section of Route 173 leading to Grove City in 1922..Its studios are located on Portage Avenue in Downtown Winnipeg, while its transmitter is located near Springstein..

When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.."
 The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now..
"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring.As of 2007, the Town Crier was published 22 times a year, with weekly issues in the summer and periodic issues in the late fall, winter, and early spring..All four editions were sponsored by Park Drive cigarettes, with an edition held in the spring and autumn of each year..Set in the spring of 1816, after the Battle of Waterloo, it is the story of the return home from the wars of the Seventh Earl of St Erth to claim his inheritance..It serves the counties of Warren, Washington and Saratoga in New York State including the cities of Glens Falls and Saratoga Springs.. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."
" It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it.The complex was built by the Virginia Hot Springs Company in 1928 to support the operations of the nearby Homestead resort..Beginning amid controversy, judge Kyle Sandilands was replaced by Sony Music record executive, Jay Dee Springbett..Blue Springs is a spring in Marion County, in the U.S. state of Florida..He was made a Major at some point between the fall of 1680 and the spring of the following year.. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story"

I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again.However, during the spring runoff water will back up behind the northern dam..The first graduating class received their diplomas in the spring of 1994; with the gradual enlargement of the student body, 1996 was the first four-year graduating class..Edenvale is an unincorporated place in Springwater Township, Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada..The Hampden Savings Bank building is a historic bank building at 1665 Main Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1)."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year.

In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding.

She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring.With the award, Springfield can admit up to 5% of their Secondary One intake through the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise, in addition to receiving MOE funding..Their name and mascot is based on a famous bubbling spring that is the source of a nearby lake..The single was also featured in television network BET's 2007 Spring Bling event during their performance..There are After School Satan clubs in cities across the United States, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Pensacola, Washington, D.C., Tucson, Springfield, MO, Seattle, WA and Portland, OR.. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."
"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store.Redstone Castle or Crawford House is a historic building in Manitou Springs, located within the Manitou Springs Historic District..According to the 2000 census, the Points community has a population of 478.Points is named for its location at an intersection, namely where Jersey Mountain Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 5) and the old Springfield Grade Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 3) intersect..The comic has been published in HUMO since 1981 with only a minor interruption from October 2011 until the spring of 2013..On October 11, 2006, it was announced that the Noise planned to play in the World Basketball Association for the spring/summer part of the year, while remaining in the ABA for the fall/winter part.. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."
 I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold.. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on
"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again.The Journal of Nanoparticle Research is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Springer Science+Business Media..Blood Brothers is a five-song EP by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, released in 1996..Mike Blair was then the editor until spring 2008..Arvest Ballpark is a stadium in Springdale, Arkansas.. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle."
 I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back..
"The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on.She then uses these workers as slaves to bring up her own offspring..The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul the Apostle is an Episcopal cathedral in Springfield, Illinois, United States..Also cricket teams visit from the UK regularly during the spring and summer..Westcott was an automobile produced in Richmond, Indiana and Springfield, Ohio in the United States between 1909 and 1925 by the Westcott Motor Car Company.. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ .It is also the club's first season under manager Marc Skinner, following David Parker's departure in December 2016.Following a reorganization of top-level women's football in England, the 2017 season will only cover half of a traditional season's length, while the FA WSL shifts its calendar to match the traditional autumn-to-spring axis of football in Europe..Started in 1976 and occurring every spring, the festival shows a diverse range of independent films, including genres such as experimental, horror and sci-fi..The church is in the diocese of Canterbury, and the deanery of Ospringe..It was established in 1949 and is published by Springer Science+Business Media on behalf of Institute of Statistical Mathematics....and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."
"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet.Further south, there are other buildings identifying with Belmont, such as Belmont Baptist Church, the Belmont Ruritan Community Building where the Belmont Ruritan Club meets each evening at 7 p.m. and serves as the district's polling place for registered voters, and the Belmont Fire & Rescue station manned by Spotsylvania County Volunteer Company 9.The name ""Belmont"" also refers to the voting district of Spotsylvania County of the same name that covers 48.70 square miles of the southwestern portion of the county, including communities of Granite Springs, Virginia and Paytes, Virginia..Springfield Furniture Company, also known as the General Warehouse Corp., is a historic manufacturing complex located at Springfield, Greene County, Missouri..Prior to assuming that position, he was secretary of the Massachusetts executive office of public safety and the police commissioner in Springfield, Massachusetts..Springer is currently a fire apparatus engineer with the Hanford City Fire Dept in Hanford, CA, and also a baseball coach at Sierra Pacific High School in Hanford, CA.. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."
" When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time.The city shares a border on the Arkansas-Oklahoma state line with the city of West Siloam Springs, Oklahoma, which is within the Cherokee Nation territory..Bimini Baths (also, Bimini Hot Springs and Sanitarium; currently Bimini Slough Ecology Park) was a geothermal mineral water public bathhouse and plunge in what is now Koreatown, Los Angeles, California, US..As Ocean Springs' first radio station, WOSM-FM covers local sports and community events ..However, by August of that year, it became clear that the competition would not be expanded while the current media contracts ran; the key contract with News Corporation would not expire until 2010.The tournament had been put into jeopardy after the Springboks team confirmed they were sending a below strength side for the Australasian leg of the tournament..

 The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story..
 The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year..
"The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home.The Knox Automobile Company was a manufacturer of automobiles in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, between 1900 and 1914..Pine Point is a neighborhood in Springfield, Massachusetts..Springboig is a district close to the east end of the Scottish city of Glasgow, situated north of the River Clyde..CNS Drugs is a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal published by Adis International (Springer Science + Business Media) that covers drug treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders.. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring."
"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost.As with many of the acacias, it forms attractive yellow flowers in spring..Also headquartered nearby in Northwest Arkansas are Tyson Foods, the world's largest processor of chicken, beef, and pork (Springdale); and major trucking and transportation company J.

This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown.It is deciduous and bears many large violet flowers in early spring before the leaves appear..The Connecticut River Walk is partially constructed park and bikeway in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, along the banks of New England's largest river, the Connecticut River..The Mikron Theater Company is an English touring theater company, founded in 1972, which is notable for its tours by canal boat during the summer months, and by road in the spring and autumn..The act of launching the mine from the tube would release a spring-loaded safety catch and start a timer which would arm the mine after 30 seconds.. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home."
 Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them.. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said “yes| when she planted the hibiscus.
"She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding.. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring."
. Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end
".I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens"
"The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now.It followed the sell-out Road Test Tour which took place in spring of 2009..The music video was first seen in the spring of 1992..It contains six natural springs..He called the house ""Spring Hill."". For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today."
"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one.The Statement of 1000 was a statement by 1000 Syrian intellectuals in January 2001, during the Damascus Spring, following the earlier Statement of 99 made in September 2000..She was also a resident athlete at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado..The spring garden has been restored by the new owner since 1989..Flowers occur throughout the spring and summer followed by a small capsule that produces three large seeds.. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. "
 In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again.. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.
"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test.Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Walker was raised in Iowa and in Delavan, Wisconsin, before attending Marquette University..Livingston was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 5, 1813, from portions of Caldwell Township (now Fairfield Township) and Springfield Township (now in Union County, New Jersey)..While Springfield's apartments had typically been seen as lower-class residences, developer Harris Hickox used lavish amenities, a desirable location, and his own social status to draw wealthier residents to his new complex..Undoolya is a suburb of the town of Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, Australia.. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome."
" In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed.Cool Spring was approximately ten miles away on Highway 23..Greenwood Laboratory School is a comprehensive K-12 laboratory school affiliated with, and located on the campus of, Missouri State University in Springfield, Missouri..In the 2006 edition of the list, which is based on the number of AP and IB tests taken as compared to the number of graduating seniors, Lakeside ranked 135, just below Riverwood High School in nearby Sandy Springs, which ranked 132..He has taught a two-week workshop for high school students at the Skidmore Summer Jazz Institute in Saratoga Springs, New York, Shew also concertizes and teaches worldwide, including a two-week Residency at the Graz University of Music in Austria in 2017.. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment."
"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay.Gallows Hill is an unincorporated community in Springfield Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States..The 2014 Games featured competitions in ten events (men and women events each of): 1m springboard, 3m springboard, synchronized 3m springboard, 10m platform, and synchronized 10m platform..It is located on Spring Garden Road and is owned by Crombie REIT..He lives near Glenwood Springs, Colorado.. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   "
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring.. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting."
 She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle.. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.
 So she saying she will take the test next year..
"Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1.

The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese return”, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that “In the spring"" she will take the test again."
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed.Allium fistulosum, the Welsh onion, also commonly called bunching onion, long green onion, Japanese bunching onion, scallion, and spring onion, is a species of perennial plant..Its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, shrub-dominated wetlands, swamps, freshwater lakes, intermittent freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, freshwater springs, rocky areas, arable land, pastureland, plantations, water storage areas, ponds, open excavations, wastewater treatment areas, seasonally flooded agricultural land, and canals and ditches..On September 27, 2007, it was displaced by E Street Radio, devoted to the music of Bruce Springsteen..The violence broke out after the Protestant Orange Order Whiterock parade was re-routed to avoid the Irish nationalist Springfield Road area.. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”"
"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,...He married Joyce Fleetwood, daughter of Thomas Fleetwood, Master of the Mint in the time of Henry VIII and his second wife Bridget Spring..The collecting localities range from near Colorado Springs on the south to just west of Denver on the north..Today the Boiling Springs Tavern is a restaurant and bar..Der Springteufel is a 1974 West German TV movie starring Dieter Hallervorden and Arno Assmann, directed by Heinz Schirk based on a story by Derrick Sherwin, an English television writer best known for his work in Doctor Who.. almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it."
 The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower.. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.
" The author put the paragraph in to show the he/she care about the flowers. Flowers only come out during spring and @DATE2 time and thats when you plant study all that grows in a garden.In 1977 he joined the Attitude Systems Operation of the Computer Sciences Corporation in Silver Spring, Maryland, during which time he developed the QUaternion ESTimator (QUEST) algorithm for static attitude determination..He joined the writing staff of The Simpsons during the fifth season, and he wrote several classic episodes including ""Lisa's Wedding,"" ""Bart Sells His Soul"" and ""22 Short Films About Springfield."".He was a joint winner of a 1984 Swallow's Tale Press poetry award, and was the featured poet in the Spring/Summer 2011 issue of Light Quarterly..At the 1938 Empire Games he won the gold medal in the high diving contest and the silver medal in the 3 meter springboard event..

"The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again"", because the author wants to convey that.

"There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home.

That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  "
"The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test.

The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject."
"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test.

The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up “…then I will take that teat again” which clearly states she still has hope.Maquinna Marine Provincial Park is a provincial park in British Columbia, Canada, located northwest of Tofino in the Clayoquot Sound region of the West Coast of Vancouver Island, protecting Ramsay Hot Springs, which is the name-source of the cove, settlement and former post office of Hot Springs Cove..Weidner Field is a 5,000 seat soccer-specific stadium built in Colorado Springs, Colorado..He was ultimately able to persuade the Cardinals to purchase the El Paso Diablos franchise of the Texas League from the Brett Bros. and relocate it to Springfield..Magazine journalism students at Ohio University's E.W.

"The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she’s not going to give up.The largest organic spring in the horse's body, and therefore the easiest one to observe in action, is the back, including the spine and the associated musculature that draws it together in much the same way that a bow is drawn by an archer..The Chief Andrew J.

The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good.Coolspring Township is a township in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States..Brights Spring has the name of O.

I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience."
 The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sag that the snow go away in spring time that all..
 She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test.. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder.

"
 The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed.. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.
"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting.

Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up."
" The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant.

The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task"

I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america.John Philip ""Bakkies"" Botha, (born 22 September 1979 in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal Province) is a South African rugby union player who played as a lock for the Springboks until 22 November 2014..In the spring of 1898, the first congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party recognized the Union as the party representative abroad..The first issue was published in Spring 1990..It is also rumored that the Minotaur was in fact the offspring of King Minos but his unsightly and grotesque appearance was shameful to King Minos and was the reason why the Minotaur was banished under the pretext of inspiring fear and cannibalistic capabilities..

That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   "
"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding.In the spring of 1942, the Aircraft Detection Corps volunteers received manila envelopes with a letter from L. E.

I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."

The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways."

It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom"
" In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on.The version 3 of the framework was based on Dependency Injection containers such as Spring IoC or Guice (the developer could choose between different options)..South Springvale achieved national notoriety by qualifying for the 2014 FFA Cup Round of 32..The Town House is a historic apartment building located at 718 S. 7th Street in Springfield, Illinois..For Sandy Spring's number of high- rise buildings, it has a rather small skyline, since its buildings are all spread out.. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again.He is a former Springbok during the period in which he played for the Cheetahs franchise in the Super 14 tournament, and the Free State Cheetahs in the domestic Currie Cup competition..He was born in Carletonville, South Africa and his first tour with the Springboks was to France, Italy, Ireland and England in late 2009 where he played in two touring matches..Originally named Shiloh, the city changed its name to Springdale when applying for a post office in 1872..He also played during the spring of 1991 as a defensive lineman for the Frankfurt Galaxy in the World League of American Football and appeared in one game for the Minnesota Vikings in the fall of 1991.. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "
"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.

Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."
 I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts..
"When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus.. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased"
"The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader.

The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom."
. because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place
 The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time.. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.
 She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done.. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about
 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time.. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.
" The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life.The male that wins a fight may also have the chance to mate with a larger number of females and will therefore pass on his genes to their offspring..This was the United States broadcast television schedule on the four commercial television networks airing entertainment programming on Saturday mornings for the season beginning in the fall of 2010 and ending in the spring of 2011..Early, Early in the Spring (folk song) (Roud 152, Laws M1) is a British folk song that has been collected from traditional singers in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Canada and the United States..This spring, located just below the 13th green of the golf course, is still flowing today..

"the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring.."
The author chose to conclude the story like that because sheâ€™s saying that it isnâ€™t over and sheâ€™s going to take the test again.. In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.
. I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up

"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past.

She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     "
"The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the “test” again.

It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow."
"I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring the would have to start all over in growing this plant.."

This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home.Neyer was a member of the ill-fated 1980 U.S. Olympic team, the 1982 world champion springboard diver, a fifteen-time U.S. national diving champion, and an eight-time NCAA champion..Its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater springs, and rocky areas..Bruce Springsteen contributed three songs to the soundtrack..It has a single narrow, hairy leaf and one or two creamy-white flowers with pink tips in early spring..

"
"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she’ll feel good about taking the test over again.The station was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.The station had a traditional role as a transfer point for passenger services to Hillston, Lake Cargelligo, Rankin Springs, Burcher and Naradhan, most of which were withdrawn in the late 1970s..The offspring are considered to be the ancestors of modern Labradors..It also contains parts of the suburbs of Dandenong North, Noble Park, Springvale and Wheelers Hill..They are usually sold as bulbs to be planted in autumn and winter for flowering in mid- to late spring..

" The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test.In addition to ready-to-wear shows, there are men's and haute couture shows, which are held semiannually for the spring/summer and autumn/winter seasons..Lithia Springs became incorporated again in 1994, to be Douglas County's second completely internal municipality, but disincorporated again in 2001..It also serves the unincorporated communities of Joliet, McNeil, and Soda Springs..Gray attended Lafayette High School in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he played with future NFL players Lawrence Taylor and Ron Springs.. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions."
 At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work.. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons.. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again.."
"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud.There Be Spring is an album by Norwegian singer-songwriter Maria Solheim released in 2006 by Kirkelig Kulturverksted (FXCD 309)..Because of past alternate-year competitions, the 2014 competition also marked the first time the Vocal Majority competed directly against eight-time champion chorus the Masters of Harmony of Sante Fe Springs, California..Springer was merely a life trustee for the land..Constant Spring is a residential neighborhood in the north of Kingston, Jamaica.. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.     "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test.Several of his buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and completed the design of several residences in Riverside and Springfield..The Barada spring minnow (Pseudophoxinus syriacus) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae..The album was reissued by Rounder records with the title incorrectly printed as Back Home in Sulfur Springs..In the spring of 2016 she finished second on her first appearance, won the Blue Wind Stakes and then defeated Found in the Irish 1000 Guineas.. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph"
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs.It is famous for southern right whale watching during the southern winter and spring and is a popular retirement location..Stixxay won the 2016 North American League of Legends Championship Series Spring Split with CLG.As of the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational, Stixxay leads the invitational in most kills (70)..The Quakers sent two missionaries, a farmer, and a blacksmith, who arrived in Spring of 1804..When Ladies Meet is a 1941 American romantic comedy film by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer starring Joan Crawford, Robert Taylor, Greer Garson, Herbert Marshall, and Spring Byington in a story about a novelist in love with her publisher.. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying.Two adult generations emerge each year, one in late spring and one in summer..The prototype used a monocoque body structure and adopting the ""ponton"" style appearance, with an independent front wishbone suspension and a rear leaf spring suspension with three plates and a live rear axle..In both systems, females take care of their offspring, but males may play a role, as well..This refers to such as the ability to successfully reproduce to create offspring, and furthermore sustain life by avoiding alike predators and sharing meals.. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes."
 I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack..
"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that.It is a small, low-growing shrub with crowded leaves and in spring, scattered pale greenish-cream and golden brown flowers..Amymone/Hypermnestra is represented with a water pitcher, a reminder of the sacred springs and lake of Lerna and of the copious wells that made Argos the ""well-watered"" and, by contrast, a reminder that her sisters were forever punished in Tartarus for their murderous crimes by fruitlessly drawing water in pitchers with open bases..Cottonwood Springs Dam, another Corps of Engineers dam is located about 5 miles to the southwest..This was the United States broadcast television schedule on all three commercial television networks on Saturday mornings for the season beginning in the fall of 1970 and ending in the spring of 1971.. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things."
 The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she’s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here.. She’s said  and does lots of fun things.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home.The following spring, using seed from the first harvest, they planted their second crop, only to watch in dismay as the crickets attacked..It lies within a bay into which several streams flow, including the waters of mainland Singapore's only hot spring..The spring was so named on account of crystalline rock outcroppings..The unincorporated community is part of the Springfield, Illinois metropolitan area, and is served by Illinois Route 54.. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace."
"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother.He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2005, retiring shortly after spring training with a back injury..Unlike the larger litter sizes of many other rodents, the dwarf hutia gave birth to only a single offspring..Although not tracked by the Census Bureau, Elm Springs had been assigned the ZIP code of 57736..Megalothorax minimus is a species of springtail in the family Neelidae.. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.The 1996 Maryland train collision was an opposite-direction collision that occurred on February 16, 1996, when a MARC commuter train collided with Amtrak's Capitol Limited passenger train in Silver Spring, Maryland..The United States men's national inline hockey team is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado..Gravel Springs was established in 1872..Pyrgulopsis aardahli, commonly known as the Benton Valley springsnail, is a species of minute freshwater snails with an operculum, aquatic gastropod molluscs or micromolluscs in the family Hydrobiidae..” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test.After disappearing from the Soviet order of battle for more than a year a new division was formed in the spring of 1944, based on a cadre of two distinguished rifle brigades, and gave very creditable service for the duration, completing its combat path in East Prussia..D.M.

"  The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined.District 19 includes downtown Boise, the North End, East End, Foothills, Warm Springs Mesa, Foothills and Highlands areas of Boise..The property includes a brick smokehouse, a two-story spring house and granary, and more..A legend is that when the people of Avenay suffered from a lack of water, St. Peter appeared to Bertha and showed her a field where there was a good spring which she bought for a pound of silver..The Bow River flooded in the spring of 2013, causing major damage to many areas in Calgary and its surrounding communities.. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up."
"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time.On September 20, 1893, Springfielders Charles and Frank Duryea road-tested the first-ever American-built, gasoline-powered car in Springfield, which they had built at the Stacy Building..Rohmann was born in Yellow Springs, Ohio..This success resulted in supporting The Offspring on the Americana tour..Since 2005 Springbank Distillery bottles a whisky called Hazelburn Single Malt..

Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."
" The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test.His body was moved in 1856 from Presbyterian Church cemetery at 12th Street to the new Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio..Lake Lorraine State Park is a small Massachusetts state park located on the northeast side of the city of Springfield..It was recorded during the band's Spring 2005 tour of Australia..He ended his competitive career in 2009 and became a coach in spring 2009.. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”.2019 Colorado Springs Elections will be held in 2 segments in 2019..Lee Spring is an unincorporated community in Smith County, located in the U.S. state of Texas..In spring 2001 part of the sea wall protecting the outer pool collapsed, creating a tidal lagoon..Mixer 103 A four-channel stereo mixer with built-in spring reverb, stereo panning, and mono FX send/return..

Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test.""

She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1.In the second round HFC lost to Colorado Springs Switchbacks 1-0..St Peters Springfield has since grown to a Kindergarten to Year 12 school and moved to a new state of the art location in Health City..On February 26, 2015, a gunman shot and killed seven people in several locations across the town of Tyrone, Missouri, an unincorporated community about 95 miles east of Springfield..The Captain John Mawdsley House, located at 228 Spring Street, is one of the oldest houses in Newport, Rhode Island..

"In the story , “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring.

Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken..During Spring and Summer of 2008, a task force of Marines and paratroopers established a base of operations in the desert to the north of the lake and conducted patrols of the surrounding area to break the supply lines..Michael Paul Springer (born November 3, 1965) is an American professional golfer who has played on the PGA Tour and the Nationwide Tour..It is located in DeLeon Springs, off CR 3..Pipe Dream is the twice-weekly student newspaper of Binghamton University (State University of New York at Binghamton) in Vestal, N.Y.

The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on."
"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea.Recently, several television networks have staggered new and returning shows without necessarily following a fall and spring schedule..This movie is a sequel to the film Offspring..Orogastrura is a genus of springtails in the family Hypogastruridae..The cylinder does not use the traditional top- and bottom-pin combination, relying instead only on the holes in the side of the pins and pressure applied by the 12 springs above.. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did."
"The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”, says her mother.It arrives in Queensland in late spring and breeds high in an isolated tree, producing three to five young each year..Deacon began hosting the Sunday night slot on BBC Radio 1 from 7pm in March 2010 following the Chart Show, prior to the spring 2012 reshuffle..Stevens's older brother, David Gordon, attracted the attention of music producer Mike Hurst, formerly of the Springfields, in the hope of finding a producer interested in his younger brother's music..Storz was one of the ""Big 4"" brewers located in Omaha, which also included the Krug, Willow Springs and Metz breweries.. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself “Then i will take the test again.”     "

This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years."
"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.The Mississippi River is identified as the River Sidon, and Big Spring (in Carter County, Missouri) is identified as being the Waters of Mormon..In 2016, SpringCM opened two new offices in San Francisco and London, and in 2018 SpringCM open an office in Bucharest..Competing in the 3 m springboard she won gold medals at the 1967 an American Games and 1968 Olympics and placed fourth at the 1964 Olympics..Waconia is derived from a Sioux-language word meaning ""fountain"" or ""spring""..” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful."
" He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again.The drama program produces one fall musical, a one-act winter play, and one spring play..Anthony Bean Community Theater & Acting School (ABCT) was established in the spring of 2000..Her main research interest concerns how genetic and environmental factors interact to regulate maternal behavior, and how natural variations in this behavior can shape the behavioral development of offspring through epigenetic changes in gene expression in a brain region specific manner..The street is thought to be named after Baron Thomas Spring Rice, Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Melbourne.. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants."
"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed.Its studios are in Silver Spring, Maryland and the transmitter site is in Capitol Heights, Maryland..He played number eight and captained the South African national team, the Springboks, between 1995 and 1999..Starting from a number of small springs, it is not unknown for the river to flood, and as its source is in an urban area the flooding can hit a wide area..It depicts a female baboon standing up, holding its offspring.. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that’s how the girl feel.Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, freshwater springs, and heavily degraded former forest..It was created when Fairyhouse and Navan agreed to swap the distances of their two Graded Chases scheduled for the spring..The property is a stone cottage on a 17 hectares (42 acres) block of land known as Springwood which was originally owned by the Australian artist and writer Norman Lindsay..Springsteen only rarely plays ""Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?"". She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did."
"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced.The cactus flowers in the early spring..Toystory was a Holstein bull that has sired an estimated 500,000 offspring in more than 50 countries around the world..Formed in Silver Spring, Maryland, the band comprised vocalist Pam Berry and instrumentalists Archie Moore, Brian Nelson and Mike Schulman..The Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI), first published in spring 2009 and updated in 2011, analyze and compare the need for reform in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, as well as each country's ability to respond to current social and political challenges.. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   "
" I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.Morells are an American rock band from Springfield, Missouri..The carbines were built by Massachusetts Arms Company of Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts; the American Machine Works in Springfield, Massachusetts; or the American Arms Company in Chicopee Falls..The show began in the spring of 1986, and concluded with the eighth season in summer 1993..Spring Mills is an unincorporated community within Holland Township in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States..  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time."
"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself.The village name is an Old English language word and means broad spring..In 1993, having won numerous major California races including the prestigious Santa Anita Handicap, Canani took a break from racing until the spring of 1997 when he returned to operate the Nick Canani Racing Stable at Hollywood Park Racetrack..It is located off Falls Road between Northern Parkway and Coldspring Lane, and is home to luxury condos and upscale small shops..A show's evergreen status can also be grounds for cancelation once a show has built up enough of a backlog of episodes that can be rerun without the viewer realizing the show has ended production; The Jerry Springer Show is one such example.. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story."
"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph.Yuba College graduates an average of 300 people each Spring..It is still held early each Spring in Denver, Colorado, and attended most years by the magazine's founder, Bill Gates..It is known from Comal Springs in Comal County, and Fern Bank Springs in Hays County, Texas..Nearby to Ruthven was the community of Schuster, which was once the location of the Wilcox Mineral Springs Resort.. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time."
"In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers.He also called select Mets games during both spring training and the regular season during that time..They play at Robin Roberts Stadium at Lanphier Park and are based in the city of Springfield, Illinois..The team participated in the Women's Spring Football League in 2011 and 2012..Neither the teams nor the cities have been announced yet, but the league will follow a similar structure as it did in 2001, with eight teams centrally owned and operated by the league, competing in a ten-game season and a two-week postseason in the winter and spring months.. At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."
 I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese..
"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond.This usually takes the form of regional conferences held in the spring and in the fall..Poomarangal (Flowering Trees of Spring; 2013), also published as Maoist, is a novel written by Praveen under nom de guerre Roopesh..A partial solar eclipse occurred on November 9, 1855 during spring..The National High School Ethics Bowl currently has 32 regional competitions across the United States, and the national competition takes place every spring at UNC-CH.. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."
. I think they think it will bring them luck
"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming.The Hopeful Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York..Clarendon spans U.S. Route 7 and is split by the highway, the Cold River and Mill River, Otter Creek, and the Green Mountains into the villages of Clarendon, West Clarendon, East Clarendon, Clarendon Springs, and North Clarendon..The Offspring, which celebrated the 20th anniversary of the band's third album Smash..Midhurst, Ontario is a small community in Springwater, Ontario, Canada and the seat of Simcoe County.. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng."
 Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better..
"In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test.The fourth season of Offspring, an Australian drama television series, premiered on 22 May 2013 on Network TEN..In the Spring 2018 semester, the seminary had an enrollment of 53 men, representing 11 dioceses..The name for Lameroo Beach comes from a corrupted interpretation of the nearby Aboriginal site Damoe-Ra, which means ""eye"" or ""spring"" in Larrakia..Lomographa semiclarata, known generally as the bluish spring moth or wild cherry looper, is a species of geometrid moth in the family Geometridae.. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted."
" The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1.Cabrera began her broadcasting career in Colorado, where she served in positions like writer, photographer, editor, reporter and anchor for various stations including KJCT in Grand Junction and KOAA in Colorado Springs..This can be caused by human pollutants, including herbicides, which can act as estrogen promoters or inhibitors, which would respectively increase or decrease the number of female offspring, through controlling aromatase..The latest LP, ""Coyote in the Graveyard,"" comes out in Spring, 2018..The route runs through the major cities of Decatur, Illinois and Springfield, Illinois.. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph."
"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it.Their final collection was Spring/Summer 2015, shown during London Fashion Week..Her book, Meeting the Needs of Older Adults with Serious Illness, was published by Springer Publishing in 2014..As a measure, fertility rate is the number of offspring born per mating pair, individual or population..She was an editor of the Springfield Republican, Good Cheer Magazine, and later the New York Evening Post.. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test.In 1976, Greenberg retired from the business and sold her record labels to Springboard International..On 29 November, she sailed for Green Cove Springs, FL, with orders to report for inactivation..Adults are found feeding at Crataegus, Anthriscus and Rosa canina in Spring and Summer..Renovations were completed in the spring of 2006.. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times.Tours, and followed two lengthy tours by Springsteen without the Band in the intervening years..Tireman Avenue follows the former southern boundary between Greenfield and Springwells Township..St Paul's Presbyterian Church is a heritage-listed church at 43 St Pauls Terrace, Spring Hill, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia..Cold Spring Farm, also known as Peter and Louisa Morton Farmstead, is a historic farmstead located in Todd Township, Fulton County, Pennsylvania.. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "
 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring..
"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it.On January 29, 2009, Brown was released to clear a roster spot for Russ Springer..The Spring Creek Meeting was organized in 1844 outside of town..The sales sense springs from real estate, where closing is the final step of a transaction..Following a move by the LNP organization to install Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman as leader of the state Party from outside of Parliament, both Langbroek and Springborg lost their positions to Newman and Jeff Seeney respectively.. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means."
 The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well..
"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well.Randolph County School District, also known as Oak Ridge Central Schools (ORC), was a school district based in Randolph County, Arkansas, near Ravenden Springs..Spring Handicap is a 1937 British comedy film directed by Herbert Brenon and starring Will Fyffe, Maire O'Neill and Billy Milton..The settlement had a post office from 1875 to 1901.All that remains of the settlement is the Big Springs Cemetery..On March 1, 2017, Woods was found guilty of fifteen federal counts for his collusion in a kickback scheme involving Oren Paris, III, the president of Ecclesia College in Springdale, Arkansas, where Woods resides.. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."
"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy.Located in the Southern Willamette Valley, it is within the Eugene-Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area..Connecting bus service is operated from the station to: The Village of East Lake , East Lake Golf Course , Clifton Springs Health Center,North Dekalb Mall and Kirkwood (Atlanta)..The Model 54 had a relatively heavy two stage trigger pull, which was greatly improved in the Model 70.Standard chamberings included the .22 Hornet, .220 Swift, .250-3000 Savage, .257 Roberts, .270 Winchester, 30-30 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield, 7x57mm Mauser, 7.65x53mm Argentine, and 9x57mm Mauser..This makes the Township of Middlesex Center very desirable for farming due to frequent precipitation, while it also has higher than normal snowfall from lake-effect snow in the winter creating desirable spring planting conditions (yet less desirable snow removal issues for its residents).. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring.Pleasant Springs is a town in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States..Glidewell is located approximately four miles north of Springfield, just east of Missouri Route 13 on a county road that accesses McDaniel Lake on the Little Sac River..Richard Arlin Green, known as Rick Green (born March 23, 1971), is an attorney and politician from Dripping Springs in Hays County, Texas, who is a Republican former member of the Texas House of Representatives..Historically it has been a wellspring of hacker culture.. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready."
"The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1.. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.Ricardo Enrique Silva is a Cuban doctor and dissident who was imprisoned during the Black Spring in 2003..Moffat County comprises the Craig, CO Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Steamboat Springs-Craig, CO Combined Statistical Area..Spring Valley High School is a high school located in an unincorporated portion of Wayne County, West Virginia, United States, with a postal address in the nearby city of Huntington..Sighthill is part of the wider Springburn district in the north of the city..” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."
