Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The hibiscus is budding represents growth. The author will be older and more knolageble and more skilled than before."
 The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it.. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.

" The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up.

Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up."
"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .Fortunately two hospital cars were included in the passenger train manned by members of the Medical Corps and tended the injured until rescue trains arrived from Ogden..North Pole Radio is an American radio network specializing in Christmas music..The Photos and The Dancing Did Formed as a cathartic reaction to the death of Nicola's boyfriend, Stuart Dyke, who was killed in a car crash in 1981..A previous mention of an ""Oscetel"" as either a sacrist or treasurer in 949 may or may not be the same person..” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  "
"The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine.She also pursued a career in acting, with a supporting role in the CBC Television sitcom Material World..The 14th Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best in film for 1956 films, were held on February 28, 1957, at the Cocoanut Grove, Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)..It is the largest agro park in Malaysia and Asia..At the 2007 Canadian Country Music Awards, Farrell was nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year and the Chevy Rising Star Award..

And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future."
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right.Pulikkottil Hyder (born in 1879 at Wandoor) was a popular poet who composed short songs in Arabi-Malayalam on topics of common interest, often attacking social evils..Computer Backup - An online backup tool that allows Windows and macOS users to back up their data to offsite data centers..The company focuses on transport via mobile app..The year 1523 in science and technology included many events, some of which are listed here.. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening.The official associate school of the company is the La Scala Theater Ballet School (Italian: Scuola di Ballo del Teatro alla Scala), a constituent of the La Scala Theater Academy (Italian: Accademia Teatro alla Scala)..The network includes stations in Coventry, South Staffordshire, Warwick, Stratford-upon-Avon, Nuneaton & Hinckley, Loughborough, Banbury and Rugby, both of which still retain their local branding..In the mid-1990s, the X-Rated Critics Organization honored West by inducting her into the XRCO Hall of Fame..The song was produced by DJ Two Stacks, who added the high hats and Adeptus..

Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about."
"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly.By the summer of 1942 the Japanese had taken over more than 320,000 allied prisoners..Dr. Harrison holds a bachelor's degree in Intermediate Education from Methodist College, a master's degree in Educational Administration and an Education Specialist degree in Education Administration from East Carolina University, and an Educational doctorate in Education Administration from Vanderbilt University..He also helped his club win ten national titles, having made it to the CONCACAF Champions' Cup final on three occasions..Other historic insurgencies, such as the Russian Civil War, have been multipolar rather than a straightforward model made up of two sides.. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.” @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."
"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior.It was originally developed as a text-based game written in BASIC..Caetextia can also exist in a temporary form prompted by stress, anxiety, or depression..In Minnesota, the governor was elected to a four-year term for the first time, instead of a two-year term..He was knighted on 16 March 1681 after drafting the address approving of the dissolution of Parliament.. She said ‘’when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     "
"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life.The station is owned by Foothills Media, Inc. and broadcasts with 1 kilowatt at 1240 kHz on the AM band, as well as over the internet..The series has been described as a simplified version of E.

There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     "
"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more.Sexsomnia is characterized by an individual engaging in sexual acts while in non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep..Ithente Neethi is a 1987 Malayalam-language Indian feature film directed by J.

For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."
 I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden.. Without no friends just let in her mom
" The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is.Lar-e Gari is a village in Bamyan Province in central Afghanistan..The Mahindra Xylo is a CUV, designed and manufactured by Mahindra & Mahindra..Kelly Marie Carlin-McCall (born June 15, 1963) is an American writer, actress, producer, monologist, and Internet radio host..Matthew Suckling (born 25 July 1988) is an Australian rules footballer who plays for the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League (AFL).. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test."
"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring.. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life."
"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam.She appeared in more than fifteen films since 1999..Harald Kohr (born 14 March 1962) is a German football coach and a former player..It is affiliated with MVS Radio's Exa FM..Phil also assisted in ""Coach Talk"", inside the sixth edition of Shamrock's Rugby League book.. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become..Federal elections were held in Germany on 2 December 1990 to elect the members of the 12th Bundestag..There is a general lack of facilities, equipment, qualified teachers, textbooks and other resources..As a result, the non-stick coating adheres to the pan and lasts longer..The firm also won the ALPMA Thought Leadership Award in 2017, and has been noted for its growing representation in leading legal directories... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas."
 The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around..
" The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ’’Winter Hibiscus’’ with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over…’’ In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding… connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ’’take that test again…’’ By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ’’@CAPS1 of loss.Grand Masters often led their knights into battle on the front line and the numerous occupational hazards of battle made some tenures very short..Most of the graphic content from the shows were removed to be more appropriate for children, small content edits were also done to allow original programs to fit in the 23 minutes of non-commercial time that a normal half-hour program has on network TV, resulting in footage from the shows to be trimmed down..The Unified Model software suite is written in Fortran (originally 77 but now predominantly 90) and uses height as the vertical variable..Bonanza is a studio album by Jamaican reggae singer Michael Rose..’’ and to her grief.

"To her the hibiscus was a test.

Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test."
"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test.Peter John Daniel Rogers (born 20 January 1969 in Maidstone, England) is a former Wales international rugby union player..Louis Pelletan was Governor General of Pondicherry in 1902, during the Second French Colonial Empire under Third Republic..Other key members of the program are former Hawthorn player Ben Dixon as Assistant Coach, Leigh Russell as the Elite Performance Manager and Port Adelaide fitness coach Darren Burgess as the High Performance Coach..Scopula duplicipuncta is a moth of the family Geometridae.. For example when she said, ”When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. "
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower.The Dallas Police Association also has a musical choir..During the summer, the arena is used by an association football team FC Volga Ulyanovsk..Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made with vodka and penne pasta, usually made with heavy cream, crushed tomatoes, onions, and sometimes sausage, pancetta or peas..It is the first single off of his upcoming debut album Bigger Than Me.. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle."
".The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it’s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng “cheep skip over live to you’re back she saw cheerfully” @CAPS1 it’s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to"

 The author includes that because it show that she is not given up.. Since she is not given up she can have more trys.
"Confidence, persistance, memories – all things that Saeng has “that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, “then I will take that test again,” shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won’t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress.During 2015, he was the head coach of Kerala Blasters of the Indian Super League..Taylor was born in Melbourne, where he studied at the Victorian College of the Arts from 1985 to 1987, and graduated with a BFA..The lagoon is an important habitat for resident and migratory birds with seventy three different species being recorded..It is a timed event..

The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She says, “I will take that test again”.

"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives.

With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that’s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can’t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now”. Saeng didn’t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won’t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories.

With Saeng’s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."
"The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.Nick Gerakines (born Baton 1983) is an American author, speaker and software engineer..It was discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751-1752 from South Africa, and cataloged it as Lacaille I.7..Timothy Edward Howard was an Indiana State Senate senator and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Indiana, writer, poet, professor of law, and Civil War veteran..It provides a range of services to personal, business, commercial, corporate and financial intermediary customers from its base in St. Helier, Jersey..The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes."

Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it’s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph."
 The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring.. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.
"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”.. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."

First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two.The Washington County Jail is located on Cherry Street, beside the courthouse, in downtown Washington, Pennsylvania..Baronetcy of Stevenson in the County of Haddington, is a title in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia..Malgachinsula tsarafidyella is a species of snout moth in the genus Malgachinsula..This film starred James Rennie, Anders Randolf and Dorothy Mackaill in her first starring role.. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that."
"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months.Each year, various events celebrate and raise awareness of the importance of all types of forests, and trees outside forests, for the benefit of current and future generations..It was an advocate of professional football and many of its staff were actively involved in the sport..Alongside was the fourth season of the Toyota Cup taking place..Cuproxena latiana is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     "
 So she did not forget to take the test again..
 Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter..
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country.Two of the three main tenants are businesses with a substantial insurance broking component, which are therefore reliant on close proximity to the Lloyd's building and the globally-significant London market in insurance contracts that focuses on Lloyd's of London..Haapsu is a village in Saaremaa Parish, Saare County in western Estonia..Other stronger consistency models like sequential consistency and linearizability have downsides such as: they take too long and require more space; also in terms of implementation, they are unattainable in some situations..The Yimas language is spoken by the Yimas people of Papua New Guinea.. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."
"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying.The album debuted at #49 on the Billboard 200 with 23,000 copies sold in its first week..The prison conducts diagnostic processing for the state correctional system, houses male offenders under death sentence (UDS), and carries out state ordered executions by lethal injection..Laugh in abject horror as Oderous Urungus, The Sexecutioner, Slymenstra Hymen, and company Rape, Burn, and Pillage their way into your heart..To date there have been 14 films in all.. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past."
"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world.Four divers all from the United States competed..Abhijeet Singh Sanga is an Indian politician and a member of Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly..She has used the pseudonyms Kiciputek and Kittypat..Fallon won only one home game in his 14 months in charge, overall winning only two out of 46 games.."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .He served as leader of the provincially registered Alberta Party from 1999 until 2001..On November 23, 2013, the State Board Of Higher Education unanimously approved the project..Buk Vlaka is a village in Dubrovnik-Neretva County in Croatia..The group are known for their vivid imagery, complex wordplay and multi syllabic rhymes..When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”."
"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion.Since dogs age significantly more rapidly than humans, data on aging can be generated much more rapidly using a dog model than in human studies..The Kidepo River is a seasonal river along the Kidepo Valley in the Karamoja region of Uganda, and in East Equatoria area of South Sudan..It received the ""Song of the Year"" award by RIAJ.The versions were included in the official soundtrack Fever Pitch and The Official Album of the 2002 FIFA World Cup..Adventure Unlimited is a 1965 Australian anthology TV series.. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."
" The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city.The defending champion Toyota Comets and Crispa Redmanizers played in the finals for the fourth straight time..Ulriken play their matches in Haukelandshallen in Bergen..The strategic management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the firm's objectives..The activity is classified as moderate.. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty."
"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .Aside from Madden Football 64, the game was the last in the Madden franchise to lack the NFL license, which was featured in Madden NFL '94 onward..Mahler on the Couch (German: Mahler auf der Couch) is a 2010 German film directed by Percy Adlon and Felix Adlon..Also in the episode ""The Strongest Woman in the World"", there were three robots that struck a resemblance to the robots from Cyberbots: Fullmetal Madness..Torus Games began developing their first game in 1994, a Game Boy and Game Gear game based on the film Stargate, published by Acclaim Entertainment..This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."
"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1.Stenalia dolini is a beetle in the Stenalia genus, which is in the Mordellidae family..TD/SMP, short for Terminal Device/Session Management Protocol, was a terminal multiplexer system introduced by DEC on their VT330/340 terminals in 1987..Hexamine was detected with samples, along with HFP, which the OPCW-UN JIM has previously described as being one of the key indicators that the sarin used in Khan Sheikhoun came from the Syrian governments sarin process..The core of the kingdom was the area of Bihar south of the Ganges; its first capital was Rajagriha (modern Rajgir), then Pataliputra (modern Patna).. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once.. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1."
"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS.Originally scheduled for 9 October, the elections were postponed until 20 November 2016 because of Hurricane Matthew, and a new date announced..The Panthers finished with a 24-12 record, ranked 11th in the official NCAA sanctioned AVCA coaches poll..The elections were a decisive victory for the ruling United Democratic Party, which won 62 out of the 67 seats nationwide..There are 16 hanja with the reading ""hye"" and 29 hanja with the reading ""in"" on the South Korean government's official list of hanja which may be registered for use in given names..

"" ""I’d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it.Unpaid taxes can be owed at federal, state and/or local government levels and therefore are assessed by them..It was directed by Joseph Henabery and starred silent greats Leatrice Joy, Henry B.

"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life.

She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."
"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will.Teachers in Schools for Specific Purposes, Adult Migrant Education Service (AMES) and Corrective Services are also members..Spatalistis armata is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae..Asaperdina sordida is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae..Belle stated that she had more clear ideas during the creating and recording process of this album and she had a better understanding of where she wanted to go.. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again.Until 1934, it was a branch of the Swedish Lutheran mission in South Africa..The winners go on to the National Geographic World Championship to represent Australia..Prior to this he served as a fire commissioner under William Lafayette Strong, replacing Austin E.

In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."
" I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive.Liberty Bell is the most northern Spire of the Liberty Bell Group, a group of spires which also includes Concord Tower, Lexington Tower, North Early Winters Spire, and South Early Winters Spire..Upon completion of his post graduation in management, he started his career as a consultant..He is a former trustee of the University of Richmond and one of its largest financial supporters..For The Perfect Girlfriend is a couples-based adult-reality show currently airing on Playboy TV..

"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life.

She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test."
"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination.Snake robots come in many shapes and sizes, from the four stories long, earth quake snakebot developed by SINTEF, to a medical snakebot developed at Carnegie Mellon University that is thin enough to maneuver around organs inside a human chest cavity..It is also used as a staging system for documents in development, where content can be developed then transferred to a portal when complete..The operation continued several more days in August..Austrasiatica deforgesi is a species of sea snail, a cowry, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Cypraeidae, the cowries.. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  "
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year.Named for McGill University, the street was widened in the 1980s and transformed into a scenic avenue with McGill's Roddick Gates on Sherbrooke Street at its north end and the Place Ville Marie plaza at its south end..The Boeing T60 (company designation Model 520) was a family of small turboshaft/turboprop engines produced by Boeing, based on Boeing's earlier Model 500 gas generator and Model 502 (T50) turboshaft engines..The list of shipwrecks in 1879 includes some ships sunk, foundered, grounded, or otherwise lost during 1879..This gives notably good isolation from handling noise, one reason for its being a popular microphone for stage vocalists.. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."
"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her.The album was released on 30 October 2006 in the UK on Lime Records..Other divisions include the Ship Supply Chain division, Marine Services division and Offshore Division..In Sheldon, then, the Supreme Court ruled that: Congress may withhold from any court of its creation jurisdiction of any of the enumerated controversies..Rowland G.

" The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive.

It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. "

" In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”.

"The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing.. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again."
 The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself.. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself.
"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test.Ian McBryde is an Australian poet..Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is a Coptic Orthodox church in Azbakeya, Cairo..It is located near the northwest entrance to the Indiana Convention Center, which is in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, and is owned by the Indiana Convention Center & Lucas Oil Stadium..The office is maintained as a medical museum by the Crawford County Historical Society.. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her."
"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable.The stadium is notable because the fan seating is built into man-made earthen hills, and does not have scaffolding type bleachers that are typical for high school stadiums..A similar structure also occurred in the Mesozoic Heterodontosauridae..In the United States Thunder Bay Press publishes some books of the series as well..People on both sides of the boundary are as likely to use the phrase ""New Zealand stops at the Bombay Hills"".. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph."
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it.It was circumscribed by American mycologist Rolf Singer in 1944..It was made of timber and had a waiting shelter..The lower wings and back are varying shades of brown, and the throat and chest are largely white..COLA stands for ""Children Of Limitless Ability,"" a name given in recognition of the children's amazing supernatural powers.. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place."
 She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it..
 They author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want to see what people would say..
"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test.United Nations Security Council Resolution 1711, adopted unanimously on September 29, 2006, after recalling all previous resolutions concerning the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including resolutions 1565 (2004), 1592 (2005), 1596 (2005), 1621 (2005), 1628 (2005), 1635 (2005), 1671 (2006) and 1693 (2006), and resolutions 1650 (2005), 1669 (2006), 1692 (2006) on the situation in Burundi and the African Great Lakes region, the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) until February 15, 2007..It is an extension of the SWOT analysis, which helps businesses get ready for marketing campaigns; the main difference is that SOSTAC focuses more on the implementation stages of the process and on marketing communications..At the 2010 census the population was 1,148, down from 1,238 at the 2000 census..John Thomas Ferguson (born December 21, 1941) is a Canadian real estate developer.. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way."
"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind.Ballard High School is a high school in Seattle, Washington, United States, located in the Ballard neighborhood..Salem United Church of Christ, formerly known as Old Salem Reformed Church, is a historic Reformed church at 231 Chestnut Street in Harrisburg, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania..It is the setting for novels by author Tami Hoag..He started his career with Pakistan Television Network.. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved"
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope.A large rocket stage would reach a low Earth orbit and undergo later modification..In 1931, he moved to the New York Yankees..The film was released in 2007..It originated on slave plantations, where slave masters permitted its continuance as it provided a rhythm for the slaves to work by.. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."
"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her.For many years it was believed to be the home of colonial governor Simon Bradstreet and his wife Anne..Jacob Moe Rasmussen (born 19 January 1975 in Amager) is a Danish former cyclist..It premiered on CBS on November 23, 1986 and was released on DVD on March 10, 1998..Foley Park Halt was the first stop on the GWR Kidderminster to Bewdley loop line which now forms part of the Severn Valley Railway.. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  "
"The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she’ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.."
"The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying.

 She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring.. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it.
" The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country.At exactly 09:30 on 31 August 1957, the declaration was read by the first Chief Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman at the Merdeka Stadium in the presence of thousands of people including Malay Rulers, members of the federal government, and foreign dignitaries..Cedar Lake is a lake in Penobscot, Maine..Along with his film career, he is also a singer, songwriter, theater actor, author, and professor..Depending on atmospheric conditions, the objects can appear to be elevated or lowered, stretched or stooped.. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom."
 The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow.. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.
"All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country.Queens South was a provincial electoral district in New Brunswick..Pakistanis in Bahrain comprise Pakistani people living as expatriates or immigrants in Bahrain and their locally born descendants..The article provides an overview of the entire chain of command and organization of the Spanish Air Force as of 2018 and includes all currently active units..Today, Peter Baynham joined the writing team, and Lee and Herring were replaced by Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews.. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she’ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness.It was expanded in 1907 and in 1956.The 1907 expansion was an ""elegant north addition"" designed by Wichita architect C.W.

 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again.. The author is showing that the character doesn’t like this test. And would rather not take it
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she.Sarnoff was a student of John Clymer and Andrew Wyeth..Maric nominated for the draft and expected to be selected by North Melbourne..She has also contributed to the understanding of the biomechanics of Suminia, a primitive mammal thought to exhibit early evidence of teeth and jaw structure specialized for chewing..It was produced by William Alland, who would have better success two years later with Creature from the Black Lagoon.. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test."
"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up.On July 1, 2004 the Umpire School District consolidated into the Wickes School District..Some exterior scenes were even shot on location in the United States at Sedona, Arizona, the Grand Canyon and at Death Valley in California..Pakistan has also decided that will create a remake after in Bollywood..It is the primary aim of the practicing Sikh to subdue these five inner vices and render them inactive.. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things"
"Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country.

She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower."

After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes."
"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her.

So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home.The Crawshaw Academy logo is a blue and silver shield with motto ""Exellence, Purpose, Ambition""..Agyrta dux is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae..Some forms of game mechanics have been used in games for centuries, while others are relatively new, having been invented within the past decade..Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag.. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."
 The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job..
" The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back.Members of this genus were first isolated in 1977 from aborted bovine fetuses..Trishakti is a 1999 Indian Bollywood film directed by Madhur Bhandarkar..As of the 2010 United States Census, the CDP's population was 1,264..At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 6,568 and had 1192 houses in the town.. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test."
"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again.Goniotipula is a genus of true crane fly..Some diseases and conditions are caused by dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium, and some diseases and conditions cause problems with these cells, which then leads to further complications..In 2017 members of Mavka wrote soundtrack and acted in the movie 'The Tale of Money'..Players can perfect their skills as they progress from a rookie to pro in career mode and take on the best paintball teams in the world, or get online for an adrenaline rush of intense, cutthroat multiplayer action.. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."
 the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope.. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.
"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story.Stone also called races as part of All-Star Announcer Day at Monmouth Park and Churchill Downs..A total solar eclipse occurred on 3 November 2013..Built in 1878, it was designed in the Carpenter Gothic style of architecture by architect Charles L.

By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."
" The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved.Naina Deviji (Vidhan Sabha constituency) is one of the 67 constituencies in the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly of Himachal Pradesh a northern state of India..Andrei Gheorghe (born 14 September 1987) is a Romanian-born Guatemalan modern pentathlete..Khomeini often walked up a flight of stairs leading from his house to the balcony of the mosque, from which he often spoke..All of her novels are published by Bantam Books, now owned by Random House.. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test."

"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .Born in Dungarvan, County Waterford, Curran made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he was picked on the Waterford minor team..After the wound had healed, the implant simply melts away..Two ships were ordered in 1832 and another two in 1833, although one of the latter was intended to be a rebuilding of the second rate Union, and this was subsequently canceled..Kingman is an unorganized territory (township) in Penobscot County, Maine, United States..” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it."
"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her.CBS Corporation and Time Warner jointly announced on January 24, 2006 that the companies would shut down UPN and competitor The WB to launch a new joint venture network later that year..The festival shows feature length films and short films..It also contains that largest store selling John Deere merchandise..The house is large and rambling and considered eclectic in style with a prominent central projecting gable.. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test.The work is also mentioned in 16th century sources, although it was forgotten after the monastery passed to Carmelite nuns in 1628..David Cubitt (born 18 March 1965) is an English-born Canadian television actor..The story is set mostly in Pennsylvania, and the time of the narrative stretches from the early 1930s to 1950..The Voyager was modeled after the classic Minimoog synthesizer that was popular in the 1970s, and is meant to be a successor to that instrument.. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time.Mangelia munda is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae..It also has a built-in 120 GB hard drive and 2 GB RAM..Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad was a 197.9 mile railroad built by William A.

Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."
"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.The church was a pilgrimage destination for people with epilepsy and therefore has notable carved wooden laity stalls, including the ""Gerechtigkeitsspirale"" (Spirale of justice)..Nicholas Troop is a health psychologist and a principal lecturer in health psychology at University of Hertfordshire..In 1965 Smith (Hillman Imp) won the Tulip Rally outright..The ancient site is also spread across the modern municipalities of Campi Bisenzio and Calenzano; the Poggio Castiglioni hill is the site of the upper citadel of the ancient city..- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."
"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up.An accomplished player of the keyboards and rhythm guitar, he is best known for his work with Joe Satriani, appearing on many of his albums and as a member of his backing group when he is on tour..Rani is a brand of fruit-based beverages manufactured by Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Company (ACCBC)..Some have also theorized the song is about spreading the news of the Jehovah's Witnesses, due to a spoken passage that directly precedes the song on the album..They were awarded no medals.. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little.

Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "
"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time.

"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started.. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself.

She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is.The Malatestiana Library (Italian: Biblioteca Malatestiana), also known as the Malatesta Novello Library, is a public library in the city of Cesena in northern Italy..They are not sold but traded regularly as gifts in weddings, birthdays, and at funerals..It literally means ""Little Lord""..The Town of Gilboa is in the south part of the county and is southwest of Albany.. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending."
 The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal.Junior Achievement of South Florida was founded locally in 1959 by the Fort Lauderdale Rotary Club and served just 373 high school students during its first year..He gained his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981 with a thesis titled Essays in unemployment and economic activity under the supervision of Robert Solow..Murphy Lake lies at an elevation of 1565 feet (477 m)..The next edition will take place in Zimbabwe in September 2017..

 The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again.. 
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again. “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.CIRAD (French Agricultural Research Center for International Development) is a public research institution (EPIC) founded in 1984 and specializing in agricultural research applied to warm regions..Properties are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common..West of it passes the International Date Line, after which come Russian territorial islands..It was released on September 15, 2010..” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  "
"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS.He coached England women's national rugby union team from 2007 and soon left his role after the England Women's Rugby team won the Rugby World Cup in 2014..The lappet-faced vulture was formerly considered monotypical, but now is separated into two subspecies..Some regions of the US simply called the bread wheat bread, a comparison to white bread..On August 9, 2018, Nathaniel Cook was ordered to be released from prison and sent to a work-release transition program.. THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY."
 I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story..The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her.Hydropneumatic devices such as hydropneumatic accumulators or pulsation dampeners are devices which prevent, but do not absorb, alleviate, arrest, attenuate, or suppress a shock that already exists, meaning that these devices prevent the creation of a shock wave at an otherwise earlier stage..Different patterns of democratization are often used to explain other political phenomena, such as whether a country goes to a war or whether its economy grows..Democratic and liberal supporters of McCain included some elected officials, retired elected officials, journalists, and some supporters of Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful primary campaign..Although Amtrak operates many cars in its Superliner fleet that are labeled as coach-baggage, they are not often referred to as combines.. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test."
" The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past .It was a subsidiary of the Melbourne precision engineering company White & Gillespie..An orangutan called Sir Oran Haut-Ton is put forward as a candidate for election as a Member of Parliament..In 1990, they played an abridged season and went 1-5..Czecho Slovak Commercial Corporation of America was an American importer of products from Czechoslovakia..

So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal."
" The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers.

At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because she failed the test.It is spread over 17,000 acres and is covered with phulai (Senegalia modesta), sanatha (dodonea viscosa) and wild olive..She traded with the West Indies, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean..David Mciwa Mallole (born 26 December 1955) is a Tanzanian CCM politician and Member of Parliament for Dodoma Town constituency since 2010..In 1994 she wrote a government report: The Extent and Nature of Organized and Ritual Abuse.. Saeng failed to fine the fine–toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.It is among the largest Palestinian news organizations with over 200 employees, and has been established for over ten years..Remodernist film developed in the United States and the United Kingdom in the early 21st century with ideas related to those of the international art movement Stuckism and its manifesto, Remodernism..Mohammad Firouzi (Born 1958 Tehran) is a prolific Iranian musician, whose primary instrument is the barbat..The United States Semiquincentennial will be the 250th anniversary of the establishment of the United States of America..” It means she’ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she’s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl.He is a former captain of the Australian Men's Sevens team..This release is a comprehensive collection of the A and B sides of all Jackie's singles released in the United States on Liberty Records from 1960 through 1965..Giovanni de' Rossi (21 November 1431 - 1502) was an Italian condottiero and the fifth count of San Secondo..In 2014, Scott Taylor was named fellow to the Royal Society of Canada (RSC).. By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality."
" I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home.Rosanna Banfi (born 10 April 1963) is an Italian film, television and stage actress..It was jointly developed by SCEE and BT..The state mission assigned to the National Guard is ""to provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise provided by state law."".Bhavesh Patel (born 1980) is an American actor and writer best known for his role as Roland Maule in the 2017 revival of Present Laughter.. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  "
"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her.He was named to that position prior to the 2009 season..Diabolus in Musica (1998) was criticized for its nu metal traits, while God Hates Us All (2001) created controversy for its graphic artwork..IBM sold 140 type 704 systems between 1955 and 1960..Parra (1937-2004) was a Venezuelan writer, poet, and trans woman.. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages"
" Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts.Mitrovic played for the Greensboro Monarchs and Huntsville Blast in the ECHL, the Phoenix Mustangs of the West Coast Hockey League, the Detroit Falcons and Port Huron Border Cats of the Colonial Hockey League, and the Odessa Jackalopes of the Western Professional Hockey League during his career..Italian Paraguayans are one of the most prominent ethnic minorities in Paraguay, consisting mainly of Italian residents who migrated to Paraguay or Paraguayan-born citizens of Italian descent..It is simulcasted on 104.7 W284BZ..ISAT-U was founded in 1905 and is mandated and chartered as a polythecnical university by the Philippine government to provide undergraduate and graduate courses in technology education, agriculture, fishery, engineering, arts and sciences, forestry, business, health, computer, criminology, nautical and short-term vocational-technical and other continuing courses.. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story."
"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end.Rembercourt-Sommaisne is a commune in the Meuse department in Grand Est in northeastern France..Luminary Group's founder, Jonathan Faber, authored the primary elements of the bill and testified in support of the bill..Monestrol is a commune in the Haute-Garonne department of southwestern France..Giuseppe Ugo Papi ( Capua, 19 February 1893 - Rome, 13 September 1989 ) was an Italian economist.. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel."
 Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them..
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome.It innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, the flexor digitorum profundus muscle to the ring and pinky fingers, and the intrinsic muscles of the hand (the interosseous muscle, the lumbrical muscles and the flexor pollicus brevis muscle)..Stelvideo was laid out in 1851..She acted in Suno Na....U the Girl (also known as R U the Girl with T-Boz and Chili) is an American reality series that aired on UPN in 2005.. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again."
 The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng.. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding.The Wild Duck Cluster is one of the richest and most compact of the known open clusters, containing about 2900 stars..Arhopala johoreana is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae..The season contained 14 weeks of regular season games followed by a Final Four weekend in August..Fossils have been found from the Lower Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of western Liaoning, China.. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."
"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then.The first of these running from 1960 and until approximately 1965, at which time a typical Fender Concert was priced at $315..The Tatanagar - Asansol Express is a express train belonging to Eastern Railway zone that runs between Asansol Junction and Tatanagar Junction in India..It was one of the sports that took the Games to regional Victoria, with games being played in a number of regional centers including Traralgon, Bendigo, Ballarat, and Geelong..The game was released on January 1, 2015 for Microsoft Windows.. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things."
"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity.It is found from the coast of Angola to as far north as the North Sea, and eastwards through the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and Red Sea..The pub serves food and has live music every Friday evening..Osborne is a railway point and unincorporated place in geographic Osborne Township in the Unorganized North Part of Nipissing District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada..Paul McCartney controls the publishing rights to the song through MPL Communications.. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.."
 The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now..
"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring.Louis Marandi is an Indian politician and belongs to Bharatiya Janata Party..After a huge success of Devdas album Shreya Ghoshal was immediately called by various regional film industries for recording songs in her voice..Most notably, he was the executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) from 1980 through 1993..The journal covers a wide range of topics: ""two nations"" and ""three faiths""; conflicting Israeli and Palestinian perspectives; social and economic conditions; religion and politics in the Middle East; Palestine in history and today; ecumenism, and interfaith relations; modernisation and postmodernism; religious revivalisms and fundamentalisms; Zionism, Neo-Zionism, Christian Zionism, counter-Zionism and Post-Zionism; theologies of liberation in Palestine and Israel; colonialism, imperialism, settler-colonialism, post-colonialism and decolonisation; ""History from below"" and Subaltern studies; ""One-state"" and ""Two States"" solutions in Palestine and Israel; Crusader studies, Genocide studies, and Holocaust studies.. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."
" It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it.1340 AM WBIW has long broadcast high-school football and basketball events..Following the 1986 sale of the commercial vehicle division of Ford of Europe to Iveco, the Ford Cargo was sold in Europe as an Iveco Ford to 1991, when it was updated, becoming the Iveco Eurocargo..It is the brand name used by the Govia Thameslink Railway train operating company on the Gatwick Express route of the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise..It first broadcast in 1992 on the frequency of 103.6FM which it held until it left the airwaves in 2003.. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story"
"I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again.Solutions, expressions, and other items can be selected with the tap of the stylus..The Choctaw bean (Villosa choctawensis) is a species of freshwater mussel, an aquatic bivalve mollusc in the family Unionidae..Sarah Guyot (born April 16, 1991 in Vannes, Morbihan) is a French sprint canoeist..The story had been previously filmed as Salomy Jane (1914) and Salomy Jane (1923).. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1)."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to.While most street level stops are named for the nearest intersecting road, this station bears the name of St. Anne's Catholic School, from which the Port Authority leases the parking facility..She was a member of the Women's National Team that won the golden medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics on home soil (Barcelona)..Gauhati Town Club is an Indian sports club based in Guwahati, Assam..It was the first game by Bally to use the Williams WPC (Alphanumeric) board and also the last Bally pinball game to use an Alphanumeric Display.. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country.The Saint Francis River is a river of Grenada..It depicts the author's unconventional childhood in Morocco with her mother and her elder sister, Bella..The Forbidden Room is a 2015 Canadian romantic mystery comedy-drama film co-directed by Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson, and written by Maddin, Johnson, and Robert Kotyk..It charted at number five and forty-two on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Rap Songs charts.. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower.Unveiled in October 2006, they are a direct replacement for the LaserJet 2400 series of printers..Swiss Solidarity is a Swiss nonprofit organization for charitable, social, and humanitarian aid campaigns..She holds four Guinness World Records for ocean rowing, including first woman to row solo across three oceans: the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian..This alkali metal hydride is a colorless solid, although commercial samples are gray.. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring.The Child Cancer Foundation is a New Zealand-based charity that offers support to children with cancer and their families..The party contested the Patiala seat, but failed..Anyone with an internet connection can participate by solving 2D puzzles to fit together segmentation produced by artificial intelligence used to map the connectome..The HAZOP technique was initially developed in the 1960s to analyze major chemical process systems but has since been extended to other areas, including mining operations and other types of process systems and other complex systems such as nuclear power plant operation and software development.. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."
"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store.The type species is Methanogenium cariaci..However, the date of these engraving has not been determined and could have been made in any other subsequent period..From 2011 to 2017 he served as the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland..Because they were equipped with heavy-duty air conditioning and other features that made them suitable in hot climates, they tended to be used in the Middle East, specifically the Persian Gulf itself.. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."
 I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold.. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on
"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again.Schreckensteinia is a moth in the Schreckensteiniidae family..Clostridium tertium is an anaerobic, motile, gram-positive bacterium..This is a list of cities that flynas flies as of February 2018..Hasanlar is a village in the District of Gerede, Bolu Province, Turkey.. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle."
 I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back..
"The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on.Although named after Peasholm Park, the station is not located in Peasholm Park, but is actually situated across Burniston Road, adjacent to the Open Air Theater in Northstead Manor Gardens - part of the historic Manor of Northstead..It was synthesized in 1984 by Shell International Chemical..Bostrodes is a genus of moths of the family Noctuidae..The American Association for Physician Leadership is an educational organization focused on physicians who hold leadership and management positions.. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ .Franck Lambert (born September 10, 1960) is a French sprint canoer who competed in the early 1980s..In the 1970s, Article 102 was employed by the courts to set a precedent for invalidating detentions under the Special Powers Act..It was sold in 1988 and in its present incarnation is known as the American Airlines Shuttle..The first was released by Polygram on its recently acquired Island Records label in January 1990....and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."
"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet.He stayed behind in Eritrea during this period..Restaurants include Johnny Rockets, Maggiano's, The Capital Grille and several others..It is a component of the synaptonemal complex formed between homologous chromosomes during the prophase of meiosis..She then had spells as a guard ship at the Nore and the Humber.. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."
" When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time.The Current President of SLVF is Hon..Trees are either male or female..However, periods may occasionally start as young as eight years old and still be considered normal..The election was won in Veneto by the center-right House of Freedoms coalition, which won also nationally, by a landslide..

The author put that in the conclusion because he don’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants."

Picking them, @CAPS1 them. “Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye”    "
 The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story..
 The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year..
"The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home.Ksenia Kablukova (born 16 June 1998) is a Russian ski jumper..She covered the September 11 attacks for Newsweek in 2001..He was released to a halfway house in 2009..There are sound reasons for motion picture producers to turn to the Bible as source material.. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring."
"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost.Rather than being designed as practical, many Goa'uld devices, such as the staff weapon, are designed to have higher visual impact, meant to intimidate and reinforce their position as gods to their followers..The center is located on Highway 33, 13 miles east of Watonga and 16 miles west of Kingfisher..Some ideas included livening up the plenary sessions and a State of the Union debate..In all previous board based wargames, chits or markers had to be placed on the board representing enemy units.. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown.Birkenhead was a member of the committee for the 1924 Olympic Games, and more than 50 years after his death he was portrayed by actor Nigel Davenport in the 1981 film Chariots of Fire..An American screen writer who grew up in Hutchinson, Kansas (born October 15, 1961), he attended film school at California State University, Northridge..Craighead previously served official photographer to former First Lady Laura Bush in the administration of George W. Bush..Its manufacturing plants were located in Higashiura, Aichi and Tottori, Tottori, Japan.. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home."
 Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them.. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said “yes| when she planted the hibiscus.
"She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding.. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring."
. Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end
".I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens"
"The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now.Lookout! reissued Grow Up the following year, altering the cover art and track order and having the album remixed by Ben Weasel of the band Screeching Weasel..The 2013 Christchurch mayoral election was part of the New Zealand local elections and was won by former MP Lianne Dalziel..They offer books on most Standard Grade, Intermediate 1, Intermediate 2, Higher and Advanced Higher courses..It is found in western Turkestan, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Iran.. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today."
"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one.Varela has stated that her character is not one-dimensional and is complex with both strengths and weaknesses..Based in Calgary, Alberta, the Fillies were to play their home games at the Stampede Corral..Orakzai Subdivision is a subdivision located in Orakzai District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan..It contains almost all of the band's recorded output, including four studio albums, an EP, a single, and an edit of a compilation track.. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. "
 In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again.. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.
"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test.McGuire and Trooper continue to tour and perform across Canada..Chauliognathus deceptus is a species of soldier beetle in the family Cantharidae..Golden Youth have been quickly developing a strong following through their video postings on YouTube..Jenny Lidback (born 30 March 1963) is a professional golfer.. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome."
 In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed.The white-eared cotton rat (Sigmodon leucotis) is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae..The 2000 census found 958 people in the township..The chariot ceremony of Ganapati is celebrated on Maghi Pournima..He is also known as 'The Merry Medic'.. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment.
"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay.Above them was the Pleroma, where were exhibited the first manifestations of the evolution of subordinate existence from the great First Principle..Anderton is a marketing co-ordinator for an Australian book distributor, but spends her nights and weekends writing dark fantasy, science fiction, and horror..Together, Current Publishing's surviving papers, the American Journal & Lakes Region Weekly, along with the four Forecaster editions dominate the Southern Maine market in circulation and local news coverage..Chicago Place is a mixed-use high-rise on the 700 block of North Michigan Avenue (between Huron and Superior) in Chicago along the Magnificent Mile anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue.. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   "
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring.. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting."
 She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle.. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.
 So she saying she will take the test next year..
"Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1.

The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese return”, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that “In the spring"" she will take the test again."
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed.Corbett's widow kept a cow on the grounds at one time while a major city grew around it..Hatnagoda is a village in Sri Lanka..But it was never separately enumerated in the censuses, so this may reflect the number of people with Barbersville addresses..Rajakeeyam is a 1995 Indian Malayalam film, directed by Saji, starring Babu Antony and Charmila in the lead roles.. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”"
"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,...Protest marches organized by the movement have at times led to violent clashes with civil authorities and have been accompanied by extensive property damage..Miermaigne is a commune in the Eure-et-Loir department in northern France..During the panic, call money would reach 125 percent, the highest level since the Civil War..The track is one of Weird Owl's most well-known songs, and has been noted for its ""catchy and chill out atmosphere"".. almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it."
 The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower.. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.

Flowers only come out during spring and @DATE2 time and thats when you plant study all that grows in a garden.The cartoon deals with Charlie trying to get Porky to adopt him after his old owner dumps him at Porky's farm on a trip disguised as a picnic..Additionally, presence of a preexisting mental disorder may heighten the chances of becoming involved in an abusive relationship..Chennai defeated Hyderabad by 8 wickets to win their third IPL title..They are a charity registered in England and Wales under charity number 1136270..

It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say’s, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.”"
" The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her.It is possible that the son of Jacob named Gad is named after Gad, although the text presents a different reason, the (ketub) quotation of Zilpa (Gad's mother) giving the reason of Gad's name could be understood that way..His daughter Dominique plays collegiate volleyball at University of Wisconsin - Madison..Rita Panahi is an American-born Iranian Australian opinion columnist and critic of Islam..While in San Francisco he expanded into fiction, publishing his first novella (Afterlife)..

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place.

"The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test.

The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject."
"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly.The Commission works closely with government entities, owners of shooting locations and other stakeholders to help production units have a seamless and cost-effective filming experience in Dubai..He has performed/recorded with artists as diverse as Steve Vai, Paul Simon, Diana Ross, and Dr. Dre..The film was first designed to be a vehicle for two Fox contract stars, Marilyn Monroe and Pat Boone, with Monroe dying in 1962 and Boone turning down the film on moral grounds..Yoo Min-kyu (born September 18, 1987) is a South Korean actor..

"The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she’s not going to give up.Hersey based Treadup on a composite of six historical China missionaries, including his own father..The forge which can be seen today is a built in 1754 by the lord of Laurgain Palace over the ruins of an earlier version..He helped to establish the National Health Insurance system in Britain..Harlow Town Park is a 164 acre park located in Harlow, Essex, England.. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good.Philip Alfred Mickelson (born June 16, 1970), nicknamed Lefty, is an American professional golfer..The company provides MOSFET arrays, including proprietary designs with zero voltage thresholds..The most well-known bits not included on Sicko include: ""Jizzed by Hertz"" and ""Death from Above""..She left Hi-5 in February 2008 after ten years with the group..

 The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sag that the snow go away in spring time that all..
 She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test.. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder.

She will requperate and to the same thing next year."
"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change.His solo album Upside Down in the Full Face of Optimism was nominated for a 2002 ARIA Award for Best Blues & Roots Album..He has seven albums to his credit; these are: Sika, Sika Baa, Yeesom Sika (which topped charts in Ghana), Sika Mpo Fane Ho, Akasieni, Born Again and God Dey..Moving back to the Football League he had spells with Shrewsbury Town, Notts County and Derby County before signing for Sheffield United and then Portsmouth..786 Bredichina is a minor planet orbiting the Sun..

That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring."

"
 The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed.. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.
"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength.It was municipality prior to its merger into the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation..Pedro is probably the magister (teacher) associated with the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela from about the same time..Odice is a genus of moths of the family Erebidae..There is a blue plaque noting that the novelist George Eliot lived there until her death..

Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up."
" The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her.The United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting and Sprinkler Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada (UA or United Association) is a labor union which represents workers in the plumbing and pipefitting industries in the United States and Canada..Calton Hill is a Site of Special Scientific Interest in Derbyshire, England, showing Olivine Diorite magma chamber..Romona is an unincorporated community in Washington Township, Owen County, in the U.S. state of Indiana..The band named themselves after the Four Star vs. Mary legal case, in which Mary attempted to sue Exxon Mobil, a large US oil company..

"Because the Winter hibiscus"" was in the ground how and Saeng tomped down the soil around it.. overhead, a flock of canada greese flow by, their faint honks clear and -Yes- @CAPS1 to Saeng now. "
"The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home.

That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   "
"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding.Like many New Zealand psychiatric hospitals, Lake Alice was self-sufficient, with its own farm, workshop, bakery, laundry, and fire station..This development may be the result of internal structural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are deemed to be controlling them..Kimberly Nicole Rathkamp (born September 15, 1985) is an American pornographic actress, who goes by the stage name Kayden Kross..It is also the location of a tea shop and several restaurants.. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."

 The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story.. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a “comfort in time of distress” a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the @ORGANIZATION1

It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom"
" In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on.On the other hand, professional boxing have produced 40 major world champions (including those of Filipino heritage), one of the most in the world..Class 741 is a class of 2-8-0 'Consolidation' steam locomotives, rebuilds from the FS Class 740 with a Franco-Crosti boiler; it was the last class of steam locomotives introduced in Italy..Games added a row of bunting flags to his first design concept when asked to make it more festive..Morse's Greatest Mystery and Other Stories is a book by Colin Dexter.. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again.Orthomecyna crossias is a moth of the family Crambidae..John Q. Hammons Hotels & Resorts was the title sponsor from 2003 to 2006..For hockey games, the band wears (over casual clothes) a custom Harvard Band hockey jersey, modeled after the home jerseys for men's hockey, which features images of Bertha (the huge bass drum) on the sleeves..In Northern Ireland, ""Lily"" increased in rank by 90 places in 2003, reaching the top 100.Following is a short annotated list of persons, real and fictional, sharing ""Lily"" as a given name, representative of the breadth in geography and time of the name's use.. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "
"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around.The pelvis (plural pelves or pelvises) is either the lower part of the trunk of the human body between the abdomen and the thighs (sometimes also called pelvic region of the trunk) or the skeleton embedded in it (sometimes also called bony pelvis, or pelvic skeleton)..Bulbophyllum verruciferum is a species of orchid in the genus Bulbophyllum..The one-millionth Corolla was a 70-series, built in February 1983..The CDP's population was 2,438 at the 2010 census.. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."
 I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts..
"When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus.. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased"
"The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home.The Jamaicaway was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted as part of Emerald Necklace of green spaces extending from Boston Common on Beacon Hill to Franklin Park in Roxbury..Lewis Township is one of the sixteen townships of Brown County, Ohio, United States..In the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time would be played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by kicks from the penalty mark to determine the winner, except for the play-off for third place where no extra time was played..Horsfieldia longiflora is a threatened species of plant in the Myristicaceae family.. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom."
. because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place
 The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time.. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.
 She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done.. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about
 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time.. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.
" The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life.However, she failed a sprint test on 21 April 2006, ending her consideration for participation..The series was one of several new titles Gold Key created when it lost the rights to the Tarzan characters by Edgar Rice Burroughs ..ICTUR has accredited status with both the United Nations and the International Labor Organization..It is assigned to the Tenth Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, stationed at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado..

"the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring.."
The author chose to conclude the story like that because sheâ€™s saying that it isnâ€™t over and sheâ€™s going to take the test again.. In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.
. I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up
"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country.They are currently led by head coach Rob Krimmel and play their home games at the DeGol Arena..Many local families enjoy picnicking at one of the 15 picnic areas along the trail..It contains one oxygen cylinder and two absorbent canisters..Stephen Alexander Bowen (born March 28, 1984) is a former American football defensive end in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, and New York Jets..

SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did."
 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again..
"When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year. She means trying to plant the plants all over again.Koza Plaza, located in Istanbul, Turkey, is Europe's largest wholesale retail facility of textiles..By 1959 Rockware employed 1,220 people on a 14 hectare (35 acre) site..The various forms and reporting methods have changed considerably since the initial introduction of the BAS..They were published on 28 December 1990 for the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Cook Islands, Mauritius, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Christopher and Nevis.. When Saeng says “Here, let me help, mother. Right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all."
"The author conclude the story with the paragraph ""when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.. She realize she has another chance to pass the test, when the spring blossoms again she begin to garden when the spring returns."
"The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again..” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again."
"“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows.Some people modify small electronic handheld toys by circuit bending, changing the circuits and adding a knob or switch that will change the produced pitch up or down..Any company or organization can sign an eFaktura agreement with their bank (though usually for a typically five-digit NOK startup fee) and send electronic bills to any client as long as they have a Norwegian online banking account..This page contains a list of Knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece..The study noted increases in testosterone and cortisol immediately after exercise, which in 2 hours returned to baseline levels.. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them."
"I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year.Bakr Ben Yahia was the son of Yahia Ben Bakr..Local Serbs in the three regions were reminded to adopt a constructive attitude towards reintegration into the rest of Croatia..Marinduque is called ""The Heart of the Philippine Islands"" as the shape of the provincial island is similar to that of a human heart..D.

Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment.Nyasaland played a series of matches in the 1930s against Rhodesia (present day Zimbabwe) starting in 1934..Marie, Monsignor Pierre Hevey organized the founding of St. Mary's Bank, which is still based at the foot of the hill beneath the church..Paul Thomas Barton (born 9 October 1935 in Wellington) is a former New Zealand cricketer who played in 7 Tests from 1961 to 1963..They are part of the Wabanaki Confederacy, along with the Abenaki, Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi'kmaq nations, all of whom historically spoke Algonquian languages.. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels."
"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying.Sports in Chile are performed at both amateur and professional levels, practiced both at home and abroad to develop and improve, or simply represent the country..Spectral dispersion is the best known property of optical prisms, although not the most frequent purpose of using optical prisms in practice..It serves listeners in Ballarat, Creswick, Maryborough, Ararat, Meredith, Daylesford, Ballan and surrounding areas..Little is known of this district, which was created after 1950 and was in use by 1988..

The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter."

"I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending.. also so you know that the story is that they could make more."
"Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding.

 The Author concludes the with paragraph because she wont to..
"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion.

The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."

"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “..In 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal; it did not address the Constitutional issues of the trafficking and abuse claims (as had the lower court), but found the Headleys had produced little evidence for their claims..Jean-Philippe Javary (born 10 January 1978) is a retired French professional footballer..She later became the host of Beat TV on Astro Ria in 2004, followed by hosting MTV Juice in Singapore in 2005..The many-finned sea serpent, or ""great sea-centipede"", a mythical sea creatureTrue centipedes (class Chilopoda) are venomous, many-legged arthropods, and while no living species are fully marine, several species inhabit the intertidal zone (including beaches and rocky shores), and can tolerate occasional inundation by seawater.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  "

 I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test.. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphisise the theme that changes in life are hard to adjust to. Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home.

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by: Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is try to adjust to @LOCATION1 coming from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant.

This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test.

"
"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she’ll feel good about taking the test over again.These core proteins carry three to five heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains, which allow for interaction with a large variety of ligands including fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, fibronectin and antithrombin-1..The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories..Offensive players such as quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers and defensive linemen are typically considered skill positions, as are tight ends on occasion..The Nazarene district purchased the property in October 1996, for the purpose of providing a Christian place for Christian groups, and churches to come together to worship God in a camp type setting..

" The author concludes the story with he paragraph because they both go togather the away there both about things going and leaving the season changing. like they don’t won’t to let go but they knew there be back soon.The sediments of the Casma Group reflect deposition in two distinct environments of the West Peruvian Basin..Rent Romus (born 1968) is an American saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist, bandleader, music and performing arts producer, and community leader living in the San Francisco Bay area..There are many colonies in this place where houses and flats are built independently..He played 32 first-class and 24 List A matches between 1999 and 2006.. Thats why the author combided the story with the paragraph."
 The author concluded the story in the paragraph.. She doesn’t want Saeng vows the whole room to herself where it’s quite when she is taking the test.
"Saeng will take the test in the spring when it’s not so cold. She likes it when the hibicus is budding they smell so good. They good smell reminders her of her native contrey.Stephen Charles Willis (7 December 1946 - 11 September 1994) was a Canadian musicologist and archivist..Kearsney is a village in Kent, England..Cyprian Ojwang Omollo (died 3 March 2017) was a Kenyan politician..In 2011 he started adding radio stations in the USA, Canada, and all across Europe and changed the name of the weekly show to Rock 'N Roll Rewind.. Saeng likes fried melon, it leaves a golden after taste on your tongue. She would poter it over a Big mac. "
"The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng “comfort in her time of discomfort.” She would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of that she fail test the first time because she was comfortable with being in a new place.Hilton Elementary School is an elementary school in Newport News, Virginia..Mangifera taipa is a species of plant in the Anacardiaceae family..The album hit at #7 on Billboard Top Heatseekers on June 14, 2008..The following is the list of episodes from the American prime time television soap opera Falcon Crest, which aired for nine seasons on CBS from December 4, 1981 to May 17, 1990..

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, saeng was talking about how she failed the test, in which she wanted to retake.. So, saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she shall take the test again."
"In the story, “winter hibiscus”, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds he so much of her home. The reason why the author conclude the story with that saying was because it gave her a goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she @MONTH1 believe that the Hibiscus is good luck so she sets a goal on when to try for the job again.The main portion of the casino consists of two 29-story towers nestled between Interstate 80 and the Union Pacific rail yard..Memorial benches are also used..It was re-issued as a deluxe remaster edition with a digipak cover in 2008..Marc Feuerbach is the current principal, but will be replaced by Shelley Tierce on July 1, 2018.. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories. In conclusion, certain things can trigger your memories, but its the good memories that make things in life something to wait and hope for."
" The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test.Callona tricolor is a species of beetle in the Cerambycidae family..However, they were replaced by the San Diego Surf Dawgs..Kigula was imprisoned in 2000..Ships in the inactive category include all that have been decommissioned.. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions."
 At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work.. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons.. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again.."
"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud.She comes from Berlin, Germany and speaks fluent English as well as her native German..The depth of an STP depends on the depth at which either the bedrock or the sterile subsoil is found..The work is written as a companion piece to the 1961 film Hercules in the Haunted World..The mascot of the school's sports teams is the Red Devil, and they compete in the Huron League.. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.     "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test.It tries to be an honest mirror which reflects their sufferance and unveils their Burka to reveal their real characters..Ajoy Kumar, a former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, was elected as the MP (Member of Parliament) in the 15th Lok Sabha, from the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha constituency..He is best known for his collegiate play at West Virginia University..When it was introduced in 1999 the Bowl initially replaced the Plate competition, which was itself re-instated several years later for the 2003-04 season.. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph"
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs.The original version featured twelve tracks..1969 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Mosport Park on September 20, 1969..The polished rod and stuffing box combination is used to maintain a good liquid seal at the surface..The film stars Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, Jesse McCartney, Christina Applegate, Anna Faris, Amy Poehler, Jenny Slate, David Cross and Jason Lee.. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying.Resistance to Japanese occupation, however, had been reduced by the hostility between Nationalist and Communist Chinese..Home is the second album by UK rock band Home..Blood Raw has since left the group..The words file is usually stored in /usr/share/dict/words or /usr/dict/words.. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes."
 I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack..
"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that.Triassic Attack is a 2010 television film directed by Colin Ferguson..Its founder and builder was the noble family of von Bartensleben..50, is a composition for soloists, chorus and orchestra by Hanns Eisler..He is the author of the story ""The Centipede"".. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things."
 The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she’s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here.. She’s said  and does lots of fun things.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home.In summer 1919, Rogozinsky's proposal to turn the Proletarian University into the Sverdlov Proletarian University, a proposal accompanied by restrictions in scope limited to creating a training school for government and party officials..He has served as a member of the Mazhilis since 2007..During its delivery from the Boeing factory in Seattle in the United States to Sydney, Australia, it made a non-stop flight from London Heathrow Airport to Sydney Airport..Once racing began Chiyo took second at the first corner before taking the lead going up Mountain Straight.. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace."
"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother.This is a complete list of school districts in the schools U.S. state of Florida..America is a 4-track EP by Australian singer Russell Morris, released on 2 March 1972..They had three children: Frederick Cuthbert Vodrey, Eileen Evelyn Vodrey and Harold Robert Vodrey..They are often constructed in support of extensive Mars analogs (see List of Mars analogs).. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.The film shows Karl, who was originally enthusiastic about the Nazi Party, becoming disillusioned and Helmut, who was at first wary of the Nazi Party, joining the Schutzstaffel (SS) and later being an accomplice to war crimes..She released a third album, The Word Remains with Shanachie Records..He also served as the Founder Chairman of Shimanto Bank, which is a commercial bank and a sister concern of BGB Welfare Trust..The Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway was the section of railway line between Glasgow Bridge Street railway station and Paisley, in the west of Scotland..” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test.During the same time frame, 132 U.S. aircraft or helicopters had been shot down over Laos..Linville is a town and locality in the Somerset Region of south east Queensland, Australia..Iron Brew is a caramel-colored carbonated soft drink sold in South Africa..As a result, oil shale decomposes to shale oil vapors, oil shale gas and spent oil shale.. “She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. “This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2."
"  The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined.McCoy played college football at TCU..It is served by Boni Station of the MRT-3 at EDSA..In it, Lennon celebrates his enthusiasm for the night life of New York City, and makes tongue-in-cheek reference to his ""househusband"" period..The 2008 edition was contested over 10 stages.. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up."
"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time.It was premiered on January 23, 1948..Mercer owned a small hardware store in Norfolk, Virginia..It may drop early in warm weather..Peter Serafinowicz Show is a BBC Two comedy sketch show written by and starring Peter Serafinowicz.. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."
" The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test.Ladette to Lady was a reality-based series that first aired in the United Kingdom on ITV in June 2005..Established in 1947, KGBC Radio is wholly owned by SIGA Broadcasting, Inc., of Houston, Texas..Notably, it is controlled by Australian Aborigines and is widely regarded as a symbol of Aboriginal Australia..Written by Tim Jensen and performed by Steve Conte, the song ""Stray"" is used as the opening theme for the first 25 episodes and the second OVA episode.. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”.Oh Sees, released on July 1, 2016 as part of the Live in San Francisco series by Castle Face Records..The state and federal laws regulating public school districts have become increasingly complex, requiring more and more help from school lawyers in recent years..Reprimanding takes in different forms in different legal systems..Charity Navigator gave First Nations Development Institute a four-star rating.. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness.Lasta is the Serbian word for barn swallow..The origins of the movement are associated with the formation of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in 1881..The conference consists of two-year and four-year schools from Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and one member in New York State..News producers may air VNRs, in whole or in part, at their discretion or incorporate them into news reports if they contain information appropriate to a story or of interest to viewers.. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1.Later in the series, L. Frank Baum specified that she had once conquered and ruled the Gillikin Country, as the Wicked Witch of the North, only to be deposed by the Good Witch of the North..Also, the station uses a cell tower to broadcast its signal while it looks for a studio and facilities..It is published by Inanna Publications and was established in 1978 by Marion Lynn and Shelagh Wilkinson..This constrictor feeds on rodents, and though it is favored in some locations as a natural pest control or pet, it is also considered an invasive species in other locations..

"In the story , “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower.In 2011 he also composed and performed the soundtrack for the English director Ronnie Thompson's new film Tower Block..The sabar was used to communicate with other villages..Specific amino acid modifications can be used as biomarkers indicating oxidative damage..Until 1982 he was the private secretary of Walter Hallstein, who was the President of the Commission of the European Economic Community.. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken..NCAA Division I independent schools are teams that compete in NCAA ice hockey but are not members of a conference..It is the state fossil of Wyoming, and the most commonly excavated fossil fish in the world..It covered a wide range of topics within the technology space such as Amazon.com's transition from being a book seller to providing other services, to the emergence of to the internet standards Quality of Service..Although Danao has the most concentration of factories since the 1940s, paltik production can also be found in Negros, Leyte, and Mindanao.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on."
"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea.Some people who use a great deal of carbolic soap might find that their skin becomes irritated as a result of prolonged contact..The award for the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision is selected by ESPN and ABC college football analysts..Nipper's Harbor, a community located on the east coast of the Baie Verte Peninsula in the Province of Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada..Fisheries and commercial fishing are common and seafood features widely in Welsh cuisine.. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did."
"The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”, says her mother.It debuted at No. 20 on the U.S. Billboard 200, and peaked at No. 4..The Coos Bay Wagon Road or Coos Bay Military Wagon Road was a pioneer road in the U.S. state of Oregon that connected Douglas County to Coos Bay starting in 1872..CHFI-FM is a radio station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada..Avia flew from Johannesburg to London-Gatwick Airport, which was their only route.. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself “Then i will take the test again.”     "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again.Developed by Paramount Digital Entertainment as a parody of The Real Housewives reality television franchise broadcast on Bravo, the first season follows the lives of several fictional women residing in Orlando, Florida..It was designed in 1972 by the Taliesin Associated Architects..The State Flag represents the Sovereign Military Order of Malta as a sovereign institution, and it bears a Latin cross that extends to the edges of the flag..Whale is an outdoor wooden sculpture of a whale, located in Cannon Beach, Oregon, United States.. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years."
"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.It was strongly influenced by anti-British sentiments that grew strong among the Afrikaners, especially because of the Boer Wars..Bulldog Interactive is a British independent video games developer, established in 1999 with their central office located in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, England..Madaraha is the name of a village that is situated at Meja (tehsil) in the district of Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh..The name Zougla means ""jungle"" in Greek..” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful."

This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants."
"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed.WNYJ-TV, virtual channel 66 (UHF digital channel 29), was an independent non-commercial educational television station licensed to West Milford, New Jersey, United States..The Taiwanese ambassador in San Salvador is the official representative of the Government in Taipei to the Government of El Salvador..Happy New Year is the eighth studio album by alternative rock band Oneida..Led by Dean Bridget Terry Long, the mission of HGSE is to prepare leaders in education and to generate knowledge to improve student opportunity, achievement, and success.. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that’s how the girl feel.He played for the Chicago Giants and Chicago American Giants..The Ethiopian Democratic Union or EDU, also known as Teranafit (formerly a separate group based in Shire before it merged with the EDU), was one of the political parties that formed in opposition to the Derg regime of Ethiopia..5.8S rRNA can be used as a reference gene for miRNA detection..Wola is a small town and commune in the Cercle of Bougouni in the Sikasso Region of south-western Mali.. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did."
"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced.Feeling Sideways and the ARIA award-winning Notes From A Ceiling..Magnolia is an unincorporated community northeast of Paw Paw in Morgan County in the U.S. state of West Virginia on the Potomac River..Playbox was a British children's television show that ran on BBC from 1955 to 1964..The T1 category is for cyclists with significant balance issues.. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   "
" I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.With the third issue, the magazine adopted the standard little-magazine format of the time: A4 pages, card cover, stapled..Therefore the protein is essential for the production of tri- and tetra-antennary sugar chains..The population was 3,647 at the 2010 census..In the early 1950s he moved to Los Angeles, where he found work as a session musician and continued working in big bands, usually holding the lead alto chair..  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time."
"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself.It causes a characteristic purpuric rash and an increased tendency to bleed..It discharges into the Batar near Nevetlenfolu, Vynohradiv Raion..Over the Rainbow is singer-songwriter Livingston Taylor's third album, released in 1973..In social hierarchy they are considered lower than Panchkalshi.. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story."
"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph.Central to antihumanism is the view that concepts of ""human nature"", ""man"", or ""humanity"" should be rejected as historically relative or metaphysical..The parish contains parts of Burghley Park..Featherstone High School offers GCSEs and BTECs as programs of study for pupils, while sixth form students can choose to study from range of A Levels and additional BTECs..It is very loosely based on Karl May's novel of the same name.. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time."
"In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers.Of unusual sophistication, it is a Grade II* listed building..OSCAR (operational simplified costing analysis for railways) is a railway costing model which was developed by CPCS Transcom Limited in Canada..It is hard to estimate when most boardsports were ""invented"" because people have been making homemade versions throughout history..The Presenting Sponsor of the Festival is Duke University.. At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."
 I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese..
"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond.Jayabaya abdicated in old age and sought a life of meditation as a Hindu recluse, informing a moksha he was the incarnation of vishnu, in the village of Menang, in Pagu sub-district of Kediri Regency, until the modern era still considered a sacred pilgrimage site, according to Kejawen belief system..Pete Swanson is an experimental electronic/noise artist and former member of the duo Yellow Swans..Wolf has also authored four books..The design is simple and utilitarian, other than short cornice returns.. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."
. I think they think it will bring them luck
"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming.A regular in the Second XI side during his first season, his debut first-class match came during 1960, in a match against Oxford University..In 1511 he executed some frescoes for the church at Vigano, belonging to the Carthusians of Pavia, which have now disappeared..Beacon Charter High School for the Arts is a charter high school in Woonsocket, Rhode Island that first opened in 1997..In 2014, James won an ENnie Award for Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Bestiary 4.. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng."
 Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better..
"In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test.Mickies Dairy Bar (often shortened to Mickies) is a 1950s style diner located in Madison, Wisconsin..Sri Janardhan swami was is also called ""Gopi Chandana Murthy""..Metoolithus is an oogenus of fossil bird egg from Nebraska..His research interests include time series analysis, stochastic global optimisation, probabilistic methods in search and number theory.. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted."
" The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1.Kohl Robert Stewart (born October 7, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball (MLB)..From his college days in Annamalai University, he involved in politics and continuously fighting against injustice and working for people welfare..The FVR is also part of the Southwestern Regional Football Association, one of five regional federations in Germany..While in Sri Lanka she had a job on the radio but was dismissed in a dispute over her sexual orientation.. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph."
"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it.Annuities can be purchased to provide an income during retirement, or originate from a structured settlement of a personal injury lawsuit..They actively participated in the administrative and financial affairs of Yanaon in French India..It opened in 1968 and had a capacity of 2,100 people..Amar Prem is a 1989 Bengali film directed by Sujit Guha and produced by Sandip Films Pvt.. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test.He was born in Antigonish, Nova Scotia and educated there..Tin Cup is a 1996 romantic comedy film co-written and directed by Ron Shelton, and starring Kevin Costner and Rene Russo with Cheech Marin and Don Johnson in major supporting roles..Berger was finding that many bands who had perhaps released their own first 45 were having difficulty coming up with the finances to press followups..The Sabor is composed of 151 members elected to a four-year term on the basis of direct, universal and equal suffrage by secret ballot.. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times.It is the only dual-delivery school in Miami-Dade County, providing adult vocational training in conjunction with a full-service high school..The league sits at Level 2 on the Victorian league system, behind the National Premier Leagues Victoria, (Level 3 of the overall Australian league system)..Frederick George Foulds (born 23 April 1935) is a former English cricketer..He was driving the #6 U.S. Racing Chevrolet fielded by D.K. Ulrich.. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "
 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring..
"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it.The building has housed a community center since 1959.It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998..The Bain murder-kidnappings involved the murder of a woman and her eldest daughter in Whiteville, Tennessee on April 27, 2012, and the concurrent kidnapping of the woman's two younger daughters by suspect Adam Christopher Mayes, an Alpine, Mississippi man who had known the family for many years..His name is a medieval Latin transcription of the Arabic name Khalid (or Khaled)..She was later paired with Judy Martin, in a tag team that would become known as The Glamor Girls.. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means."
 The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well..
"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well.Robert Jesse Pulford (born March 31, 1936) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey forward who played for the Toronto Maple Leafs and Los Angeles Kings in the National Hockey League..Starting with 8th National Film Awards, new category of awards for Educational Films was introduced..Senj HPP has four turbines with a nominal capacity of 72 MW each having a total capacity of 220 MW..The house was renovated in 1858 and a two-story wing added.. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."
"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy.Big Ndrova Island, sometimes called simply Ndrova Island, is an island of Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, one of the Admiralty Islands..Axel Wieandt (born September 19, 1966 in Bochum) is a German manager..The original SPLA/M Manifesto outlined 'New Sudan' as a proposed united and secular Sudanese state..Since the demise of Acunia the Wonka VM website has been hosted by software house Luminis at wonka-vm.org; however the code is no longer under active development, Wonka having effectively been superseded by the Mika VM.. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring.The comic strip became so successful that it was adapted to other popular media, including several television shows, both live-action and animated, and several feature films, including theatrical and direct-to-video releases..Starring Mary Beth Evans as wealthy socialite Sara Garrett and Kristos Andrews as her youngest ""golden boy"" son Pete Garrett, the series was created by Gregori J. Martin..The editor is Erin McKean..Saaheb is a 1985 Hindi movie directed by Anil Ganguly.. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready."
"The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1.. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.Knipp and George Snow Hill were students of Carl Tracy Hawley in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Syracuse..Greentown is a census-designated place (CDP) in Stark County, Ohio, United States..Described as a ""wrestling genius"", he was inducted into the National Wrestling Alliance Hall of Fame in 2009.Jarrett founded the Memphis, Tennessee-based Continental Wrestling Association in 1977..A shorter tower, 38 meters (123.5') dating from 1961 was the original antenna support structure for the radio station CFMO-FM..” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."
