" The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up.

Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up."
"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .It was used both in anti-air and anti-tank role and was also adapted for tank use and mounted on some TKS tankettes..The 1924 Kentucky Derby winner Black Gold ran at Latonia Race Track, and jockey Eddie Arcaro got his start there..Lymantes scrobicollis is a species of true weevil in the family of beetles known as Curculionidae..Party politics was established in the territory for the 1978 territorial election in preparation for the 1979 introduction of responsible government and the devolution of many responsibilities from the federal government to the new Yukon Legislative Assembly..” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  "
"The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine.The use of this term is therefore similar to that of the specimen type in biology (see biological types) or locus typicus (type locality) in geology..A series of crazy experiments, carried out by a scientist (Scientist Nunes) and a robot (Robot Robino), together on adventures to save humanity from villains scientists..Britt Eerland (born February 22, 1994) is a Dutch table tennis player..The 1914 Star, colloquially known as the Mons Star, is a British World War I campaign medal for service in France or Belgium between 5 August and 22 November 1914..

And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future."
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right.Presence of clay minerals in Mars, detected by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009 was another strong evidence of the existence of water on the planet in previous geological eras..An earlier recording of it can be found on the Hellcat Records compilation Give 'Em the Boot: Vol. 4..Tom Malar (born 26 August 1980) is a Czech R&B singer, songwriter and producer..He skipped the team's bowl game to avoid injury and prepare for the 2018 NFL draft.. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening.The 1950s version by Joni James was used in the popular Academy Award-winning motion picture LA Confidential..The Legislative Council of New Zealand existed from 1841 until 1951..Tell the Truth is a rock album by Billy Squier that was released in April 1993..In analog devices, the floating body effect is known as the kink effect..

Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about."
"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly.The Cathedral Church of Saint Mirin in Paisley, dedicated to Saint Mirin the patron saint of Paisley, is the mother church of the Catholic Diocese of Paisley and is the seat of the Bishop of Paisley..Its range extends from the US states of New Mexico and Arizona south through most of Central America..The design has an unpowered rotor mounted on top of the fuselage, wings like a conventional fixed-wing aircraft mounted underneath, and a controllable pitch pusher propeller at the rear of the fuselage..Spirama miniata is a species of moth of the family Erebidae..

"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior.Following stories are the examples of Kancil Stories..The Old Right was an informal designation used for a branch of American conservatism, which never became an organized movement..According to the Journal Citation Reports, it has a 2014 impact factor of 5.636..It was built in the Byzantine Revival style and is a Grade II* listed building..

So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     "
"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life.The 2017 Super Taikyu Series is the 26th season of the Super Taikyu Series..The station is served by TER Hauts-de-France trains (Lille-Flandres - Saint-Quentin line)..Finiani referred to the faction around Gianfranco Fini, when he was a leading member of The People of Freedom, a political party in Italy..The next step is elaboration, where new skills are added.. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     "
"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more.Greentop is a city in Adair and Schuyler counties, Missouri, United States..The gene is also known as SA49P01..He was drafted by the Browns in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft..It reached number 1 in the UK and was the first album put together specifically for telemarketing in that country.. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."
" I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden.Passage to the Other Side is the 4th studio album by Seven Witches; it's the first album with James Rivera singing, and the album also features bassist Joey Vera from Armored Saint..It was built in 1925 by the Union Pacific Railroad..The album is compiled from different sessions over the last decade and is presented as a taste of more new Parliament and Funkadelic material to come..The major town in Hidabu Abote is Ejere.. Without no friends just let in her mom"
" The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is.LVI utilize the transformative power of kindness to empower people to recognize their value and that of others..He contributed to the scagliola decoration of a chapel (1724) in the Duomo of Carpi..He relieved Vice Admiral Richard K.

She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test."
"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring.The term came to public attention in 1937 with the publication of Wide Boys Never Work by Robert Westerby, a novel about gamblers and hustlers..Today it is an important contemporary African art gallery, hosting the work of talented and aspiring artists from the Osogbo area and across Nigeria..The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) consider the use of DRM systems to be an anti-competitive practice..The school was established in 2004 by Willow Education Foundation.. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life."
"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam.Hylotrupini is a tribe of beetles in the subfamily Cerambycinae, containing the single genus Hylotrupes and the single species Hylotrupes bajulus..Andranovory is a town and commune (Malagasy: kaominina) in Madagascar..The FEC said that because it is important to protect the integrity of the Government, as well as to uphold the public's perception of integrity, the limitation was necessary and still complied with the First Amendment..He was born in Mombasa, Kenya, raised in London and Los Angeles, and now lives in San Francisco.. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become..Ely Dagher is a Lebanese director, screenwriter and artist known for his short film Waves '98..Following is a list of Spain national football team captains from 1980..Their song ""Africa Unite"" is featured in the African Rebel Music - Roots Reggae & Dancehall compilation album by Out Here Records..SHe last played for Turbine Potsdam in the Bundesliga... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas."

" The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ’’Winter Hibiscus’’ with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over…’’ In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding… connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away.

Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test."
"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test.After his completion the new 5,500 seats are available..On April 19, 2018, McCann announced his run for Governor of Illinois as the nominee of the newly-founded Conservative Party..A theory consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems..Moses Lamidi (born 5 January 1988 in Lagos) is a German-Nigerian footballer who last played for Danish 1st Division-side Vejle BK..

Hopefully, Saeng’s life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus”chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life.

This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country."
"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”.He was the Republican nominee once again in the 2014 election, but lost to Democrat David Ige..Traditionally, the garrison ration of an army was quite simple and often inadequate for basic nutrition..However, British Rail, together with its predecessors and successors have, on occasion, been required to operate passenger trains to an even smaller loading gage and have, as a consequence, obtained rolling stock identical to that of the ""deep tube"" lines of London Underground; these are lines built using the tunneling shield method, that were, by necessity, smaller than those lines built using the cut-and-cover method..He was the president of the Democratic Party (DP) in Uganda from 2005 to 2010.. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."

Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that."
"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months.Meanwhile, Vance is conducting interviews for a nanny..Bhandargali is a village in Belgaum district in the southern state of Karnataka, India..Dunces and Dangers is a 1918 American film directed by Larry Semon..He is excluded from the list of 27 Australian MLB players, however, as it is officially only Australian players to debut in the MLB, whereas Jordan was American only at the time of his debut.. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     "

"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden.

"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam.

"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion.During the early 1900s the firm manufactured aircraft, after World War I the company manufactured trams, and after World War II the company began manufacturing scooters and mopeds using engines from Rotax, with which it merged in 1959, forming Lohner Rotax..Mike Shropshire (born May 22, 1942), is an American sportswriter who has written for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, The Dallas Morning News, Playboy, and Sports Illustrated..From 1990 on he was a postdoc in the lab of Dennis Selkoe at Harvard Medical School and worked there from 1993 to 1995 as assistant professor..Beal was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who took a lot of wickets in club cricket for the Morlands Cricket Club at Glastonbury..

The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."
" The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring.

"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .The stadium is named after Thomas A.

However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."
"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus.

"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will.Camp meetings today are often held annually at campgrounds owned by a Christian denomination..The actress made her debut in 1960 with Ivalentha Hendthi and since then in a career spanning over 15 years, she has appeared in 72 films and along the way has worked with some of the most renowned directors and stalwart actors..He is the MBA Class of 1957 Senior Lecturer of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School..An Aero Contractors plane was used in the transport of Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen who was pulled from a bus on the Serbia-Macedonia border and held for three weeks..

"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance.

"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life.

If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."

"The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring.Since then he has toured the world and has appeared on television multiple times..In addition to OAI metadata, the library indexes selected web sites and local data collections, all of which can be searched via a single search interface..The awards have been handed out since 1982..James W.

"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story.

If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her."
"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding.

" The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese.

"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower.

At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test.Valley Nature Center has been in operation as a non-profit organization since 1984 and a new building was opened in 2014..Latvia competed at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway..They, at one time, employed Kroger Babb, who would later form his own medicine show-style production company..The teeth are nearly flat, with a central point.. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way."
"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination.

This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved"
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope.Founded in 1916 as the Putnam Trade School, it was the first technical school in Connecticut to have its own building..Because it was designed to be assembled by its owner at home, it was also a homebuilt computer..The Grass Roots' version of the song, which was given English lyrics by Barry Gross and Steve Barri, charted at #28..Caren Miosga (born April 11, 1969 in Peine) is a German journalist and television presenter..

At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."
"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her.The consortium was made up of producer Maurice Winnick, newspaper publisher Lord Kemsley, and the owner of Great Universal Stores, Isaac Wolfson..The second single from the album, ""Power Over Men"", was first played as Annie Mac's 'Hottest Record in the World' on 9 August, and was made available on streaming services the following day..Thanksgiving footrace held in Buffalo, New York each Thanksgiving Day..Sandy Thomas is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, played by Freddie Jones.. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.

The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring."
"All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country.After a nine-year hiatus starting in 1984, Best rejoined and remained with the group until departing again in 2008.In the early 1980s, Best also ran his own DIY label Iphar, releasing compilations of power electronics..Farbod Khoshtinat (born August 11, 1988) is an Iranian director, editor and cinematographer..The majority of family disputes have two sides however in family disputes between siblings it is not uncommon for several parties to be involved..The manuscript is famous for the Comma Johanneum..

In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese.

The author is showing that the character doesn’t like this test. And would rather not take it"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she.Originally known as the Stuyvesant Theater, it was designed by architect George Keister for impresario David Belasco..He won a gold medal at the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette with the lightweight men's coxless pair..The club have won the FA Cup four times, but not since 1958, and have spent the majority of their history in the top flight of English football..In 2009, the federation launched the EuroPsy register.. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test."
"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up.His arco work is featured on records such as the Janet Jackson hit single ""Again."".To honor the day of rest, pages on their website are not available on Sundays..Delia albula is a species of flies in the family Anthomyiidae..Richard Leslie Hills MBE (born 1 September 1936) is an English historian and clergyman who has written extensively on the history of technology, particularly steam power.. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things"
"Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country.

The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother"
 The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder.

After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes.
"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her.

So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home.It has four fixed nozzles and the output of the gas generator is directed to four secondary vernier nozzles to supply vector control of the stage..It led to a historically significant United States Supreme Court case, in which the Amistad captives were ruled to be acting in self-defense, thereby granting them the right to mutiny..The 2016 Mekong Club Championship is the 3rd season of the Mekong Club Championship..SequenceBase is a privately held company, is an international patent sequence information provider with headquarters located in Edison, NJ, USA.. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."
" The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job.The use of the term as an ethnic slur has fallen into disuse, but the term hunky and the public image associated with it has historic relevance in the perception of Slavic immigrants in the United States..Many of the views were cardinal to the development of the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts..The importance of the RMS lies in its ability to refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed..After brief dispersal, the mob returned to the area and found abandoned homes, which they proceeded to enter and deface.."

Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test."
"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again.There were attempts to remove him from the national team, but Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intervened to allow him to compete..Adjusted tax basis is used in determining gain or loss from disposition of the asset..It has been suggested that the distinctive characteristics of the Ronaldsway culture mean that during at least part of the late Neolithic age the people of the Isle of Man developed independently from those in Britain and Ireland..Adherents believe that individuals are capable of generating completely original insights with little attention and deference to past masters.. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."
" the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope.He plays in the back row but has also spent time at lock..All members from that time period are present, including Gibby Haynes, Paul Leary, King Coffey, Teresa Nervosa, and Jeff Pinkus..Rita Gramignani (born 12 October 1943) is an Italian chess player..Harvey McLane (born June 10, 1949) was a Canadian provincial politician.. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test."
"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story.It is manufactured by German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim..It soon became Carle's signature piece..Expanding to 36 voices, the ensemble toured Europe in 1971, and again in 1972 with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir..He wrote plays and novels also.. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."
" The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved.Lawrence Edward Gaines (born December 15, 1953 in Vernon, Texas) is a former American football running back in the National Football League..The album featured tracks produced by E-Smoove, Danny Tenaglia, Cevin Fisher, Peter Rauhofer and Maurice Joshua among others..In these soils the grapevine often struggles to pull sufficient levels of iron which is a needed component in the production of chlorophyll..They played home games at Oak Park, Carlow.. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It’s explaining moments in time.The house is now a historic house museum owned by the Chickasaw Nation and has been restored to a 1900 appearance..Its library had content from the four major record labels, as well as the Merlin Network and aggregators such as The Orchard, and Finetunes..In 2003 the definition of ""substantial disability"" was prospectively amended to require the existence of significant functional limitations in ""three or more of [..] areas of major life activity.."",..The biennial election for the Mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina was held on Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2015.. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is."
"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .Dorian Tristan Lough (born 27 April 1966 in Kensington, London) is an English actor who appeared as DS Dave Satchell in Trial & Retribution..A concrete pump is a machine used for transferring liquid concrete by pumping..The series stars Mark Feuerstein as a young doctor who, after being wrongly blamed for an important patient's death, moves to The Hamptons and becomes a reluctant concierge doctor to the rich and famous..The journal is published in English and Slovenian..” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it."
"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her.Josefa Berens-Totenohl (30 March 1891 in Grevenstein, Sauerland - 6 June 1969) was a German writer and painter..Anushka Sharma endorses the brand..It is the second of the Inspector Rebus novels..The company was acquired by IBM in 2006.. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test.It will climb up any sticks, pillars or trellises that are available, but if there is nothing for it to climb up, it will simply form a thick, feathery groundcover..CloudCamp is an unconference for cloud computing early adopters, held internationally on an ad hoc basis..Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories..Ain Merane is a town and commune in Chlef Province, Algeria.. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time.She has returned to television after 4 years, now playing the role of Vibha in MTV's new show, Warrior High..In 1913, the town began to develop around the oilfield just west of Orange, and its name was derived from being called the ""Orange Oil Field"" which was later shorted to ""Orangefield""..A total of 16 teams competed in the league this season..FTS2000 was completed in 2000, then replaced by FTS2001, and thereafter, in 2008, by Networx.. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."
"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.During the 1980s, Forsyth formed a notable shooting partnership with fellow Silver Ferns shooter Margharet Matenga, known together as the ""two Margs""..They are to be distinguished from the Bodleian or true Annals of Inisfallen..A member of the People's Representative Council since her election in 2009, she served as head of her party's faction from 2012 until being appointed to cabinet in 2014..In January 2010 the business was acquired by Gruppo Coin, separating from La Rinascente and making the Gruppo Coin, which already owned the Oviesse (OVS Industry) and Coin chains, the largest fashion retailer in the country..- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."
"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up.The railway from Bordeaux to Irun is an important French 235-kilometre long railway line, that connects the southwestern city Bordeaux to northern Spain..It controls Sam Mills (flour, pasta and vegetable oil producer), Arpis (distribution), Sam Trade (export company), Sam Gida (Turkey and CIS), Sam Trade UK (UK), Sam Trade DE (Germany) and Sam Mills LLC (United States)..Moving with lifelong friend and business partner Omar Soliman..By the following May, it had reached Kirkwood.. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test.Beginning his career as a comedian on television, he rose to fame through his performances in STAR Vijay's Lollu Sabha enacting the lead role in spoofs of Tamil films..Pellegrini served as President Judge from 2012 to 2015, when he took senior status upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70..James W. Wagner (born 1953) served as the President of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia from 2003 to 2016..It is a moderately large brook with numerous unnamed tributaries.. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "
"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise.Apart from the descriptive text, it is illustrated with more than 5,000 photographs, which have been taken especially for this encyclopedia..It is completely dependent on forest habitat, making it particularly susceptible to deforestation..Currently, there are 12 members from North and Central Europe, with baseline 1 published and baseline 2 due in December 2017..Taveuni has abundant flora and is known as the 'Garden Island of Fiji'.. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started.The music tackles a wide range of subjects and includes a good degree of social commentary and sometimes political comment..On the same day, a lyric video for the song was released on the band's YouTube channel, while the single premiered on BBC Radio 1..In the change from the 2001 to the 2011 electoral map, it gained some territory from Taillon..Bicyclus hewitsonii, the large blue-banded bush brown, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring.Keetmanshoop Commando was a light infantry regiment of the South West Africa Territorial Force..The regency has been subject to extensive drought and famine within the last hundred years..The castle is surrounded by a ditch, now dry, which was once filled with waters from the nearby Adige..She is also a part of Assamese Mobile theater industry where she played lead female roles in Kohinoor Theater against Jatin Bora.. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home.In 2011, during the lawsuit against the ""Verein gegen Tierfabriken"", court files showed that these meetings were frequently observed by undercover police investigators..The album peaked at number 121 on the Billboard 200 chart..Mandi Dabwali is a Municipal committee town in Sirsa district in the Indian state of Haryana..She is a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) elected in the 2009 European election for the North-West constituency.. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is.Uralsvyazinform became part of Rostelecom on April 1, 2011, together with the seven other Svyazinvest regional telecommunications operators and OJSC Dagsvyazinform..Catt and his family committed several robberies, all occurring while the family lived a seemingly typical middle-class American life..Technical (FIAT): US Army agency for securing the ""major, and perhaps only, material reward of victory, namely, the advancement of science and the improvement of production and standards of living in the United Nations, by proper exploitation of German methods in these fields""; FIAT ended in 1947, when Operation Paperclip began functioning..In Britain it was released under the alternative title The Girl in the Taxi in reference to The Girl in the Taxi in the English version of the operetta.. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending."
" The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal.It has been produced under contract at the Speyside Distillery facility at Kingussie, Speyside..However, the wreck of the Myola was found in 1994, in 48 meters of water off Long Reef, lying on its port side..Madsen Mompremier (born 1952) is a Haitian oil painter, known for his depictions of Vodou lwa..The Blacklist is a 1916 American drama silent film directed by William Desmond Taylor and written by Marion Fairfax and William C. deMille..

Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready."
" The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again.De Gray continued in royal service after his elevation to the episcopate, lending the King money and undertaking diplomatic missions on his behalf..Some refer to these risks as ""known-unknowns"" because the estimator is aware of them, and based on past experience, can even estimate their probable costs..This game telecast is also presented in high-definition on ESPN HD..Latent risk can most easily be described as the difference, or discrepancy, between the current observed extinction risk of a species (typically as quantified by the IUCN Red List) and the theoretical extinction risk of a species predicted by its biological or life history characteristics.. "
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again. “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.Its use as a drug was introduced by Friedrich Hoffmann..Amerila aldabrensis is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae..Moses then allows new source-language text to be decoded using these models to produce automatic translations in the target language..The broadcast company now operates on its latest congressional franchise, Republic Act No..” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  "
"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS.He also helped develop the HTML 5, XLB, and XUL specifications..There are also references to other methods for secret communications like Gudhayojya, Gudhapada and Gudhavarna..All members volunteer their services and receive no compensation..It was initially only carried by cable and satellite providers, along with some limited over-the-air transmissions in certain remote areas..

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her.Messier 47 (M47 or NGC 2422) is an open cluster in the constellation Puppis..It will be situated at the southern end of line adjacent to the former Boughton level crossing on the A5199..For example, someone convicted of capital murder may have their sentence of death commuted to life imprisonment, a lessening of the punishment that does not affect the underlying criminal conviction, as may occur on a discretionary basis or following upon a change in the law or judicial ruling that limits or eliminates the death penalty..A quickie may involve intercourse or be limited to manual or oral sex.. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test."
" The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past .English and French are both considered official languages in Canada..It began manufacturing streetcars in the late 1880s..The Macchi L.2 was an Italian biplane flying boat developed from the earlier Macchi L.1, itself a copy of a captured Austrian Lohner flying boat..Vermont Route 64 is a short state highway in central Vermont, United States..

So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal."

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again.

Saeng failed to fine the fine–toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.AAB College (Albanian: Kolegji AAB) is a private university in Pristina, Kosovo..Recording sessions took place from 2015 to 2016, with the production that was contributed by Lanez, alongside several other record producers such as Benny Blanco, Cashmere Cat, Two Inch Punch and Noah Breakfast, among others..Paris (2016 population, 12,310) is a community located at the spot where the Nith River empties into the Grand River in Ontario, Canada..The light middleweight class in the boxing at the 1996 Summer Olympics competition was the fourth-heaviest class at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia..” It means she’ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she’s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.

By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality."
" I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home.It contains the definition of a co-operative as a special form of organization, the values of co-operatives, and the currently accepted cooperative principles (the Rochdale Principles) that direct their behavior and operation..The first chairman was Cecil Hunt, a chairman of the London Writers' Circle..The team is currently coached by Amanda Janney..Formerly associated with the ganglord Dawood Ibrahim, he joined the Shiv Sena in 1996.. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  "
"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her.In all he played 31 games and scored 4 goals for Box Hill and won the Club's Best and Fairest in 1958..It was first released in 1999 on Sub City Records..Also known as the Kingston Clan or the Kingston Group, it is a part of The Order, or the Davis County Cooperative, and The Co-op Society..The house was a two-story building built of white pine in the Greek Revival style..

After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages"

Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story.
"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end.Originally released on Nude Records, the album was reissued on One Little Indian/Incantation Records in 2006..The College situated in Rahara, Khardaha, North 24 Parganas district in the state of West Bengal, India..The 1993 Japan Series was the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) championship series for the 1993 season..Vladislav Kulikov (born 8 July 1996) is a Russian professional racing cyclist..

For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again."
" The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng.Patterson Repertory Theater is a nonprofit community organization based in Patterson, California, founded in 2003..As of the 2010 census, its population was 2,151 and it contained 965 housing units..Shimon Mizrahi (born October 16, 1939, Tel Aviv) is an Israeli lawyer and the chairman of the Maccabi Tel Aviv Basketball Club..In 1868, the chairman became the city council's first mayor as determined by his fellow city councilors..

She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."
"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then.Partial transverse myelitis and partial myelitis are terms used to define inflammation of the spinal cord that affects part of the width of the spinal cord..Springboro High School is the only public high school in the suburb of Springboro, population 18,500, and the only high school in the Springboro Community City School District..In October 2008, LDB was named one of BC's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by The Vancouver Sun, The Province and the Victoria Times-Colonist..A native of Taiwan, she immigrated to the United States in the mid-1980s and founded ASI in 1987..

When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.The final took place on 7 August 1997 in Daugavpils, Latvia..Sammy White also owned the Alpine Lanes, a ten-pin establishment, in Chelmsford, Massachusetts..Kenin formed in 2000 at Duke University and later re-located to Washington, DC..Built in 1957 as Latham Corners Shopping Center, the mall was renovated several times in its history, most notably in 1977 when it became a fully enclosed and temperature-controlled shopping mall.."

"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring.The overlaid attraction is then open to guests from late-September through early January before being closed again to remove the overlay..Beechdean Motorsport won both the GT3 and GT4 drivers championships..The death of Joshua Titcombe and a suppressed report by the Morecambe Bay NHS Trust brought the spotlight onto FGH in 2011 when investigations began..The play follows Ned Weeks, a character from Kramer's play The Normal Heart.. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."
" It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it.Kyoto and Sapporo location test started on May 6, 2011 until May 8, 2011..The effects of this movement radiate from Ann Arbor into neighboring cities, and contribute to general trends of housing inequality and gentrification..It was Mayr's second opera and premiered at La Fenice in Venice on 26 January 1796..Will Destroy You, with the last three performed by Lymbyc Systym.. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story"
"I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again.It is now home to the Regional Multicultural Magnet School, grades K-5..No Dogs on Diamond Street is a 1966 Australian TV play that aired as an episode of Australian Playhouse..Radio Botswana station 1 started diffusing to its crowd in the year 1965 and during that time it was initially called the Radio Bechuanaland before the country became independent..The chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989..

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year.

In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country.It served the Charlestown Elevated, part of the MBTA's Orange Line, from 1902 until 1975..The swimming book, De Arte Natandi, was a practical treatise following a trend begun by the archery book Toxophilus of Roger Ascham, of Digby's own college..It is run at Salisbury over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 meters), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September..It usually surrounds multiple nerve fascicles as well as blood vessels which supply the nerve.. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower.20 Years of Stony Plain is a compilation album, released in 1996 on Stony Plain Records to mark the label's 20th anniversary..The style also spread beyond Europe, for example Barbados is well known for the Dutch gables on its historic buildings..Having served as Sri Lankan Ambassador in Germany and Thailand, she is known as Sri Lanka's first woman career diplomat..Until she marries the handsome peasant farmer next door.. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring.Carbon12 is a wooden building in north Portland, Oregon, in the United States..The 1966 Shield also marked the start of modern Australian players getting signed to the Major League system with Neil Page of South Australia getting signed to the Cincinnati Reds and Sid Thompson from New South Wales signing with the Philadelphia Phillies..In 1985, the stage area of the hall still included a historic mural painted by a Mr. Avery early in the 1900s depicting Karlstejn Castle in Bohemia..All the TV productions emanating from Hollywood are slipshod.. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."
"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store.Okus is a suburb of Swindon, Wiltshire, United Kingdom..Music for the song Kahin Karti Hogi was copied from The Lonely Bull..Samuel Johnson's health has been a focus of the biographical and critical analysis of his life..The following month they were dropped by RCA Records.. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."
" I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold.The French aircraft manufacturer Caudron developed this aircraft from the Caudron C.59..It also appeared in Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em: The Movie (1990)..An ethnic Alak, he claimed that the ""Khom"" (a general term for the Mon-Khmer hill tribes) were indigenous to the area and previously held much more prestige and glory, first when the Khmer Empire ruled them, and later when they were a part of the Kingdom of Lan Xang..It exhibits Spark's typical style of crossing seamlessly between temporal points in the narrative.. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on"
"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again.In the field he took 9 catches, while with the ball he took 4 wickets at a bowling average of 39.25, with best figures of 4/43..It was released on October 26, 2010 through Peek-A-Boo Records..The Herefordshire Trail is a long distance footpath forming a circular walk in the English county of Herefordshire..David later reintroduced Justice as a supporting character in Spider-Man 2099, a series with a very different setting.. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle."
" I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.One single that is notably missing is ""Tomb of the Unknown Love"" from 1985's The Heart of the Matter..The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 18, 1992..She has appeared on television in supporting roles in a number of sitcoms, including recurring characters on The Jamie Foxx Show, Strip Mall, Suddenly Susan, and Arrested Development..All five songs were later released on The Longest EP.."
"The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on.If Balian was part of the group which stayed and fought, he would have been among the relatively small number of survivors not to be captured by the Muslims..Rachel doesn't address the cause of her problems, but moves on from them, determined to better herself with education and a career..He lives in Regina, Saskatchewan..The first species Broom discovered, Bauria cynops, was a reasonably complete skull, but according to the first description somewhat poorly preserved, and apparently equally poorly prepared.. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ .Criticism was leveled at its similarity to previous games in the series and the awkward inventory system..Infinity Ward, Inc. is an American video game developer..The scheme collapsed in 2002 with the legal outcome of fifteen people arrested and charged in the U.S.A. Nine pleaded guilty; five were convicted by Jury; and one of the accused acquitted of all charges..Nathan Meyer Rothschild lived at No. 14 in the 19th century....and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."
"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet.Whereas men tend to inflate the numbers, women tend to underestimate theirs..Residents of this village are mostly of farmers..It had an average circulation of 10,020 in 1973.By 1973/74 the Independent Newspapers publications had become vocal critics of Sirimavo Bandaranaike's government..The community was initially planned by developer and attorney-lobbyist Harvey Whittemore and Pardee Homes.. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."
" When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time.She was awarded the Rome Prize in Literature in 1992, and is also the recipient of The General Electric Award for Younger Writers, the Bruno Arcudi Prize, and the Charles Flint Kellog Award in Arts and Letters..Every All-Ireland Winning Meath team has had a Skryne player as a panel member..A former leader of the Youth of the Christian People's Party (KRFU) from 2005 to 2007, Hansen was the second Deputy Leader of the party until 2011..He began his artistic career in 1953..

The author put that in the conclusion because he don’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants."

"The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home.Apart from Bulgaria, 46 of the remaining 54 UEFA member national teams entered the qualifying competition..Held from 17 June to 19 June 1944, this celebration was referred to as ""The Jubilee Celebrations of IOC"" by Carl Diem, the originator of the modern tradition of the Olympic torch relay..Rudraprasad Sengupta (born 31 January 1935) is a Bengali Indian actor, director and cultural critic..David Boshier-Jones is a British racing driver, whose career ran from 1952 until his retirement in 1961.. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring."
"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost.It is found in northern India, China and Taiwan..Real Fine Place was released in October 2005; it became her first record to debut at number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, for selling one hundred thirty thousand copies in its first week..In addition to managing state-owned lands, the Board through the Department is responsible for the Common School Fund, off-shore lands and coastal estuarine tidelands, submerged and submersible lands of the navigable waterways, unclaimed property, estates with no heirs, and additional functions assigned by the Oregon Legislative Assembly from time to time..Johannes Andres Truter, also known as Sir John Truter (11 October 1763 - 5 June 1845), was the judicial officer of the Cape Colony and president of the Court of Justice at the Cape of Good Hope.. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown.Guro Kleven Hagen (born 11 May 1994) is a Norwegian violinist raised in Fagernes..This period came to be known as Grattan's Parliament after Henry Grattan, a major campaigner for reform in the House of Commons and leader of the Patriot Party..The Rock is the tenth studio album by American country music artist Tracy Lawrence..Parliamentary elections were held in the Federated States of Micronesia on 27 March 1979..

"I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens"
"The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3.

For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today."
"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one.The high rate of violent and petty crime in Tottenham Green has remained fairly stable over the past six years..This is often measured as revenue realization: the proportion of the potential original selling price achieved..Sydney George Hulme Beaman, born in 1887 and who died 4 February 1932, was an author & illustrator best known as the creator of the Toytown stories and their characters including Larry the Lamb..Actions and the products of one's efforts are thought to be well received and praised by others.. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again.

The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her."
"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph).

" In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed.In 2007, the Maggie Dixon Classic was moved to the historic Madison Square Garden in New York City and has been held there ever since..It was released on October 11, 2005 by Polyvinyl Records in the US and by Own Records in Europe..The history of youth work goes back to the birth of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, which was the first time that young men left their own homes and cottage industries to migrate to the big towns..He recorded two albums with his own big band, the house band at the Apollo Theater on 125th Street in Harlem in the 1960s and 70s.. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment."
"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay.It is naturally important place in Niramaruthur Panchayath, the west side is protected by ""Arabian Sea"" and East with ""kanolikanal""..On November 28, 2005 a sculpture of a pretzel, about 6 feet tall including the base, was installed in the park..The Center Party, occasionally referred to as the Center Movement, was a short-lived political party that operated in the Australian state of New South Wales..Elias Neocleous & Co.

The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   "
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring.People with appropriate financial literacy training make better financial decisions and manage money better that those without such training..Eublepharis angramainyu, also known as the Iranian fat-tailed gecko or Iraqi eyelid gecko, is a ground dwelling lizard native to Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria..A catch is legal if the ball is finally held by any fielder before it touches the ground..It brings together schools and organizations interested in the guardianship of school children..

The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again.

Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject."
"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test.

By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again.The bank serves more than 500,000 clients and has more than 6,000 employees..Prior to signing with WWE, El Generico and Kevin Steen teamed in Ring of Honor (ROH) and across the independent circuit..Pascal Canavan is a former Tyrone Gaelic footballer..Sandip Burman is a tabla player from Durgapur, West Bengal, India.. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "
"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around.Alessandro Pellicori (born 22 July 1981) is a former Italian footballer and football coach, currently in charge of Palmese..The company also operates a fleet of Agusta Helicopters..Experimental filmmaker Harry Smith compiled the music from his personal collection of 78 rpm records..The film tells the story of the Andrea Gail, a commercial fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands after being caught in the Perfect Storm of 1991.. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."
" I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts.The structure is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register 01786 as well as by Waverley Council..His other sons, Guy, Bishop of Amiens and Fulk (later abbot of Forest l'Abbaye), were evidently sons by the second wife..In 2015, she wrote the libretto to the opera Entanglement by the composer Charlotte Bray..A small number of U.S. jurisdictions still permit this practice today.."

"The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home.There are three gabled dormers protruding from the front roof, one on the rear of the original house, and one on the northern elevation of the roof on the addition..They had some success in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Europe, winning 'Best New Band Award' at the Smash Hits Tour in 2002..The album debuted at number 196 on the Billboard 200 chart..AIR created music listening competitions for radio programmers in five different musical genres and were looking for a ""qualifier"" for the contests.. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom."
 because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place
" The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time.Three envoys (all patricians) were sent to Athens, to study the laws of Solon and Greek political institutions, and report their findings upon their return..Stuart William Roberts (born 25 March 1967) was a Welsh footballer who played in the Football League for Stoke City..VECC dispatches approximately 2,800 calls for service daily, answering approximately 3,500,911 Non-Emergency and police/fire emergency telephone calls annually..It is this combining aspect that ""hybrid"" refers to..

By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story."
" The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life.This event was held on 1 February 2014 as a part of the 2014 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in Hoogerheide, Netherlands..Hendrik Johannes ""Rik"" Grashoff (born 5 April 1961 in Krimpen aan den IJssel) is a Dutch engineer and politician..Drywall (also known as plasterboard, wallboard, gypsum panel, sheet rock, or gypsum board) is a panel made of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum), with or without additives, typically extruded between thick sheets of facer and backer paper, utilized in the construction of interior walls and ceilings..On July 23, 2009, just 22 days after assuming office, Cammarano was arrested by the FBI as part of a major political corruption and international money laundering conspiracy probe known as Operation Bid Rig..

" The writes this this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season's are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you you to know that when the season changes back the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers.Uroplatus guentheri is a species of nocturnal gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae..This is a list of heads of state, heads of governments, and other rulers in the year 1421..Clyburn Lake is a lake of Victoria County, in north-eastern Nova Scotia, Canada..The current attendance record for ice hockey is 8,017.. that’s what the author means when he talks about taking the test again."

In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right."
 I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up
"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country.John Lott Brown was a former university administrator and professor..They are able to play any part of any rhythm for their ethnic group and neighboring ethnic groups, in any ceremonial situation..A graduate of Hong Kong University majoring in Physics and Mathematics, in 1965, Poon completed his PhD degree at the University of Southern California..Corbara is a commune in the Haute-Corse department of France on the island of Corsica..

SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did."

"“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows.Equestrian Scouting and Guiding is a form of Scouting that combines Scouting and equestrianism..The gentleman farmer can employ laborers and farm managers..It was released by Viva Films on April 29, 2015..Callum David Cockerill-Mollett (born 15 January 1999) is an English-born Irish professional footballer who plays as a full-back for League One side Walsall.. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them."
"I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year.It is now known as Dalton Barracks and is used by the Royal Logistic Corps..It was created on 23 February 1628 for Dame Elizabeth Richardson..The undivided province's representation encompassed the present-day provinces of Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur and Dinagat Islands..One-third of the councilors were elected each year in a three-year cycle.. Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment.She was named after the Norwegian island of Vigra..Due to his multiple joint replacements, ""The Bionic Man"" became one of his nicknames..A new version of the show, entitled Cinematech: Nocturnal Emissions, was shown during the Midnight Spank block..Zabel broke into comics in 1977, helping to draw a promo ad in an issue of Power Comics' Cobalt Blue.. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels."
"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying.The European version features the exclusive bonus track ""Time to Get This Money"" which is produced by Ahmed and features DJ Premier on turntables..Jared Tozier Spears (born August 15, 1936) is an American composer and music teacher..In 2005 WEC held 5 events beginning with, WEC 13: Heavyweight Explosion..Her work has appeared in many journals, including The Kenyon Review, Narrative Magazine and The Sun..

The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter."

"The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason.

" The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year.

She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story."

"Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding.

"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home.Audichron was a talking clock, or a time announcer which was developed and produced by the Audichron Company, starting in the 1930s..In 1990 against Devon in Torquay he brought up the milestone off just 36 balls..It focuses on the bittersweet romance between Leona Samish, a single American executive secretary vacationing in Europe, and Renato Di Rossi, a shopkeeper she meets in Venice..The Gwalior state was a part of the Maratha Confederacy in the 18th and 19th centuries, and a princely state of the colonial British government during the 19th and the 20th centuries..

The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."

"Thes Author, In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept.

"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring.

As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass."
"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring.

"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “..It was released on September 8, 1998 through No Limit Records and was produced by the label's production team, Beats By the Pound..This variety is notable for a cross with a McIntosh red to produce the Macoun, which had been thought to have produced the Honeycrisp..This point is the intersection of the Loughborough Navigation, the Leicester Navigation and Loughborough Wharf of the Grand Union Canal..The university is home to an extensive student life, with more than 155 student organizations and an active Greek community.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life.

"
"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’.

" The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad.

"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs.In baseball, a leadoff hitter is a batter who bats first in the lineup..Soul music dominated the U.S. R&B chart in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere..The line through Utterby remained open for freight until December 1980..The song ""City of Angels"" is featured in the soundtrack for the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles.. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying.Both Neveldine and Taylor have written and directed several films together that include Crank, and its sequel, Crank: High Voltage..With nearly 1,800 employees, Sharon Regional is Mercer County's largest employer..Types of dance can entail body movements, expression and collaboration..A center half forward from Nathalia in the Murray Football League, Parker moved to Tongala in 1991 and won the Morrison Medal, Goulburn Valley Football League best and fairest in his first season..

There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles.

The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace."
"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother.Lippendorf Power Station is a lignite-fired power station in Lippendorf, which is located in the municipality of Neukieritzsch, near Leipzig in Saxony, Germany..Over a lengthy career he has collaborated with Kenny Rogers, Lionel Richie, Roger Miller, The Smothers Brothers, Michael Martin Murphey, Mason Williams, The Jackson Five, Pam Tillis, Collin Raye, and many others..This particular zone, beginning at 2000ft above sea level over most of southern Camp Pendleton, can only be active for a certain number of days per year, thus allowing small planes to fly a direct route over land between the two metro areas instead of being diverted offshore or into mountainous terrain further inland..The MAT-76 is a large circular Romanian minimum metal anti-tank blast mine.. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past.

In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."

"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds.

Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."

That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning.

Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test.""

Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it.

Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."

At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."

"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond.Mateus Cole Ward (born January 18, 1999) is an American actor..The license was subsequently revoked in 2003 at the station's request..The Hill Nubian languages, also called Kordofan Nubian, are a group or dialect continuum of Nubian languages spoken by the Hill Nubians in the northern Nuba Mountains of Sudan..Mynyddbach (Welsh: Mynydd-bach) is the name of an electoral ward (and a community and suburb) in the City and County of Swansea, Wales.. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."
 I think they think it will bring them luck
"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes.

"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese.

When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test.A turbo will have a positive value at expiry when the spot settle above the strike AND the spot has never fallen below the strike during the life of the option (if it had done so the option would have crossed the barrier (=strike) and would have become worthless)..DeBris is listed with the Women Environmental Artists Directory, has been cited by EcoSalon as one of four artists whose work raises awareness of environmental concerns, and has been listed as one of ten key eco artists..Perissoza scripta is a species of ulidiid or picture-winged fly in the genus Perissoza of the family Ulidiidae..Both are so common in the American West that they are sometimes used interchangeably.. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times.It was founded on January 1, 2014 as a merger between Rovaniemi University of Applied Sciences and Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences..2012 Colorado and Washington (state) passed laws to legalize the consumption, possession, and sale of marijuana..However, only a few are related to the type species..When refinancing, if the homeowner wants to refinance the first mortgage and keep the second mortgage, the homeowner has to request a subordination from the second lender to let the new first lender step into the first lien holder position..

Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "

"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it.In addition the lock and weir streams there is stream further to the east which used to be the Mill Stream..Named after the Bimal clan since they were the major element in the resistance..The Division of Oxley was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Queensland..Ropes Independent School District is a public school district based in Ropesville, Texas (USA)..

"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well.The mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb425) from which matuzumab was derived was developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Produced and developed by Merck Serono in cooperation with Takeda Pharmaceutical, it has undergone phase II clinical trials for the treatment of colorectal, lung, esophageal and stomach cancer early in the 2000s..He is the founding editor and present editor-in-chief of the bilingual online cultural magazine Tinpahar..The neighborhood, which is near T.O. Fuller State Park, is also the oldest in South Memphis..In 1852, the college was established when Boston businessman Charles Tufts donated 20 acres of land to the church to establish the college.. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."
"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy.The following table contains some of the surnames of Yerukala tribe..Ceratophysella pratorum is a species of springtails in the family Hypogastruridae..Its license was revoked by the Albanian government in August 2014..As of January 3, 2007, all Internet Drafts have expired and the mailing list has been closed down since there had been no traffic for 6 months.. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring.Gaining over five million viewers on its first showing, the episode is considered as one of the best from the first series by fans..50Languages, formerly Book2, is a set of webpages, downloadable audio files, mobile apps and books for learning any of 56 languages..Ram, besides, played the lead role as well alongside newcomers Sadhana and Shelly Kishore..Volunteers provide emotional and practical support during pregnancy and for one year after birth..

That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.Mesoplia is a genus of centris-cuckoos in the family Apidae..In the social sciences, a social group has been defined as two or more people who interact with one another, share similar characteristics, and collectively have a sense of unity..As of 2015, $1.28 billion USD has been disbursed for 457,100 claimants..The Lang Stane in Aberdeen, Scotland is a granite Menhir type standing stone that sits recessed into an alcove at the south east corner of 10 Langstane Place, just off Aberdeen's main thoroughfare Union Street..” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."
