"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test."
"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “. in the spring. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same"
"” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle."
" Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus"
"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself.,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool. just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese"
"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   "
"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels"
"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother.  "
"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through."
"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."
"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence"
" The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was"
 Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again.
" @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it"
"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  "
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1"
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage"
"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"
 Reserved need to check keenly
" In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. This quote:– “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence"
"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable. She was depressed and homesick. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit."
" After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."
 It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.
"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. However, both oF them must and will adOpt to their new environments"
""
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too"
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represent saeng’s determination and the situation she has now. She was disappointed like “mashaft of the war afternoon starlight. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. Last she burst into tears again. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. “spring” symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. It symbolizes hope."
"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. Now she can be prepared."
" The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. "
"- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."
" Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  "
" Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine. She is finally settling into her new life and says that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future."
 The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test."
" The conclusion mentions the “test” again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she “failed the test”, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow"
 To Saeng her failing the driver’s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     
"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation"
"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories"
" She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl."
" The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle"
" It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader"
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country"
 This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story.
"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. "
" The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today"
" Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did"
""
""
"In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."
"The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”, says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself “Then i will take the test again"
 The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries. She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn’t  home she said “ I failed the test .” This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn’t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal.
""
" She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."
""
" I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."
 He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test
 The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming.
" “ .and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"
"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here"
" “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  "
""
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."
 The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph.
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”"
 The snow is melting represents change from cold to warm. The geese returning represents a new life as in coming back to something semi–new. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The author will be older and more knolageble and more skilled than before.
" The flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight to Saeng's character. We now know that eventhough it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and love, she will have the strength to make it in a new world"
" The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won’t stop until they are in the south for winter. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal"
"Thes Author, In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the habiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng knew seeing the flower again will make her cry, will make her memories come back, she will be re tested"
 This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better.

The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes.
"The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that “never giving up is important” is presented and carried out hopefully through the character’s vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard"
 The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her.  "
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again."
"The story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing “when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. That’s what @NUM3)"
""" The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending. I mean, it’s not like the kind we had at – at – she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before"
 In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much.
" The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve."
" This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up"
" She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes “saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain."
""
"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences. SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs."
" Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it.”"
" ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn’t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, “but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac"
"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it"
"The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test. I thiNk the author was compariNg the hibiscus to their life aNd obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still staNdiNg theN that meaNs everythiNg will be fiNe to where she caN go back aNd take the test"
 This is shown when she says “a blossom of two would have blown into the well” It reminds her of her homeland. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing.
" Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     "
" The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you."
"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test."
The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation
"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change."
"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up."
"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again"
 The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task
 The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again.
""
"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on"
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back . I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. "
"The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. “This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2"
I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise.
The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.
"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "
’’ and to her grief
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later"
""
I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test.
 Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland
"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past"
" When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.” This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation."
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything"
""" the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense."
The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination
" She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won’t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better."
" ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied.” @CAPS1 starting over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle"
"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower"
" Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime"
"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well."
The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test
" I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better."
" It is about how Saeng misses home and filed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad"
"She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes"
""
"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again” because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life."
" Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life"
 
""
The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test.
 The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant.
" When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time"
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."
" ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."
""
 She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner’s permit test. Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job.
"With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”"
" (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."
"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ‘’when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again.     "
" He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"". This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does"
""
"Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. After all, winter is no time for a flower"
" So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”"
""
"Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. "
""
" For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in"
 After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes.
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring."
"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. and that she would come back, just like they did.  "
""
"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"
""
"The story like this for mine reasons. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that."
" She feels ready when that time comes around. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again."
  The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up.
 I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts
""
 because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place
""
""
""
"the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring"
""
 She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring
""
The author chose to conclude the story like that because sheâ€™s saying that it isnâ€™t over and sheâ€™s going to take the test again.
""
""
 That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life
"I think the authour chose to end the story this way to show that the girl is remembering her past and being at, ease. with the flower she at a since of peace"
 The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story
 At if she can passed it again because she doesn’t like to take the test over and over again.
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas"
""
""
""
 Without no friends just let in her mom
 I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it
 So she says when everything is right
""
" When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories"
""
 The reason why she says she is going to take the test again because she sold the plant to somebody. 
 It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not
 Thats why the author combided the story with the paragraph
""
""
""
"To her the hibiscus was a test.” The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test."
""
I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test
 about passing the test.
""
 It shows in this time of doubt that she will overcome. In the story the plant showed hope and in showing this gave her hope
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed"
""
""
 The author is showing Saeng’s determination to pass the test and do better next time.
 I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom
""
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that’s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can’t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now”. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng’s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt"
""
