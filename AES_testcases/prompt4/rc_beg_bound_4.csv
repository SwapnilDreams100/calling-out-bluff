. When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring.
" Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. That, at least, she could hold on to. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously.She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant a live"
"“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb.“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. Panouvong made no resistance. The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng"
" That, at least, she could hold on to.“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home"
" Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply.”.“What happened?” she asked, more gently.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about. It is about how Saeng misses home and filed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. She let herself by the flower and remember her home. That make her sad"
" “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said.Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt"
".The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph."
"Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.It was like walking into another world."
"A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus.In the story “winter Hibiscus“ by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma"
" “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.“That’s all?” Mrs.“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan.In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus"
".The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time."
"Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho. Panouvong said nothing. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight."
"And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too.Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam.There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring"
".The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again."
. The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself.
"”. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant.The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal"
"  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine. Like the geese.1.A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick"
" Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her.“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the.“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said."
. She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it.
. They author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want to see what people would say.
" Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying"
Mrs. That’s what matters. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.”.The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination
"Mrs. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”"
"“I’d love it,” Saeng said.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng.Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus.And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her"
".The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she’ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant."
" And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought.“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question.She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground."
. She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it.
"Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.“Nothing else.For a long moment Mrs. The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow"
. The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.
" Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.“Nothing else.“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question.All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story"
"“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously.“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan.I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese"
. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character doesn’t like this test. And would rather not take it
" Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight.For a long moment Mrs. “Where did you get it?”. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc"
" “Let’s plant it, right now.“Then what else—?”. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off"
"Mrs. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home"
"  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan.  The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen"
"”.”. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. “I’m glad you got it.

"“Then what else—?”. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan.”.The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u"
" “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye.The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back"
. The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job.
"For a long moment Mrs.“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons"
" Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the.For a long moment Mrs. That, at least, she could hold on to.Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again"
. the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.
" Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"
" Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile."
"When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng."
" It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng.I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding "
" A hot, moist world exploding with greenery.“Nothing else. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.”.Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her"
" How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”.”. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner.The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities"
"“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb.Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags .“Nothing else.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down"
" Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes.Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced.In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home"
" How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up"
" Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye.In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal"
"“Then what else—?”. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time"
".The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"
"It was already dusk when Saeng reached home.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said.“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring"

. I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.

"Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus.“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”.She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers"
"She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel.When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently.Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam.The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again"

That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her"
" Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said.“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test"
"“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. Like the geese.Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags ."
. Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them.
" She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.“I know,” her mother said quietly. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery.“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test"
. The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.
" Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.”.The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it"
" Panouvong made no resistance. Like the geese.And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her.The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide"
" Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus.“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity"
".The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph."
. The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.
"Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now.The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time"
" “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Where did you get it?”. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb.“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her."
" “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb.“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination"
"For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.”.The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year"
"For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.”.The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome"
" She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply.“I know,” her mother said quietly. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought.“How much?”."
"It was already dusk when Saeng reached home.And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought.In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1)"
" “Goodness, it’s past five.It was already dusk when Saeng reached home.She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden"
. I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on
" The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it.”. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her.”."
. I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.
"“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel."
" “I’m glad you got it. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said.One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ."
"”.She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb.There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story"
" Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. Panouvong said nothing. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds"
" “Dok faeng-noi!” she said.“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. That’s what matters. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought."
. The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.
. The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year.
" Panouvong said nothing.A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket.The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home"
" But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation"
" “I’m glad you got it. Panouvong made no resistance. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel."
. Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said “yes| when she planted the hibiscus.
".She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring."
. Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end
".I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens"
" Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said.When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently.Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus.The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles"
"  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel.“Nothing else. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one"
. In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.
"“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.1.Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus.In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph)"
"It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. Panouvong said nothing.Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus.“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country"
" The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it.“That’s all?” Mrs. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"
".In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting."
. She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.
. So she saying she will take the test next year.
"It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. Like the geese.Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. “Goodness, it’s past five.Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland.

This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"

I paid over nineteen dollars for it.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,.."
. The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.

The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this.

Did you—?” Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind.“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously.The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons.

. The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sag that the snow go away in spring time that all.
. She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder.

Panouvong made no resistance.The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring"
" “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. That’s what matters. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it. I will take that test aGain"
" Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. “Let’s plant it, right now.“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story"
. The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a “comfort in time of distress” a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the @ORGANIZATION1
" That’s what matters.“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced.“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story"
" Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. That, at least, she could hold on to. I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story"
" That’s what matters.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on"
"”.“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her.The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her .."
" “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. That’s what matters.And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around"
. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts.
".When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased"
"“That’s all?” Mrs. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her"
. because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place
. The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.
. She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about
. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.
" How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. “I’m glad you got it. Panouvong made no resistance. The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life"
"And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too.“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.It was like walking into another world. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant."
".the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring."
.The author chose to conclude the story like that because sheâ€™s saying that it isnâ€™t over and sheâ€™s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.
. I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up
" “Let’s plant it, right now.Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.”."
" Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it.“How much?”.The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable.

" And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket.Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year"
".The author conclude the story with the paragraph ""when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She realize she has another chance to pass the test, when the spring blossoms again she begin to garden when the spring returns."
".The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again."
"“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question.“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"
" Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience.

"Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? . A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment"
" “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced.“I’d love it,” Saeng said. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it.“I know,” her mother said quietly.“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her"
. The auther mad it seem like he did not like it but he loved flowers and he like working in the syr wit the people his mom is anierpaady he liked to see him togod wit his life that come back becus thay liked the place.

" She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply.”. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year"
".I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more."
" “Not like the kind we had before,” she said.Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought."
. The Author concludes the with paragraph because she wont to.
" “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased.Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight.The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool."
. The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.
. She wrote that response to tell everyone   that  she  will  be ready  but the time when spring  comes.    Then   she  take it and pass.
".The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won’t stop until they are in the south for winter. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal."
" “I’m glad you got it. Panouvong said nothing.  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.Thes Author, In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself"
" Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased.It was already dusk when Saeng reached home.She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground.  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine.In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life"
"And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply.“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled.Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam.The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both @CAPS1 is being ""root bound"
" But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? . The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner.Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags .The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice"
".The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn’t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng’s determination to pass the test and do better next time."
" Like the geese. Panouvong made no resistance. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her.The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng She is a teenager her family just moved to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng failed her driving test and on the walk home discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus she falls in love with the Hibiscus"
. I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.
. The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight you’ll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people.
"Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? . It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again"
. The author concludes the story with this Paragraph because so you can get a view of what she is saying and also so you can understand it from her situration she was growing up like for example she said that
".The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said; “when they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."
"There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen.Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus.”. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind."
"“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng."
"“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye.“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try"
" Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner.”. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphisise the theme that changes in life are hard to adjust to. Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home. The flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying"
"“That’s all?” Mrs. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. I paid over nineteen dollars for it. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home"
".The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She relizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explaned in the last paragh that once the hibiscus buds she will take the test again."
"Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? .“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye.The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her"
" “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs.“That’s all?” Mrs. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said.In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life"
".The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end."
"“That’s all?” Mrs.“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.“Nothing else.“What happened?” she asked, more gently.The story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing “when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough"
. She said that because she was more intrested in flowers tha a test.
. The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to get the point out that the character dosnt want to rush into things she wants to  do right and not take the quick way out.  
"“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now.“I know,” her mother said quietly.”.The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represent saeng’s determination and the situation she has now. She just come to the new country and she haven’t adjusted herself to this new country yet. She was disappointed like “mashaft of the war afternoon starlight.” “war” showed saeng was ery upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much “snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. “spring” symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring"
" It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? . What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind.“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus.The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that’s when she is going to take the test again"
".The author concludes the story with the paragraph to tell you when Saeng was going to take the test again also ,to reunite with the plant again. This is a conclusion paragraph that gives insight on what will happen in the future that’s also why the author added this paragraph in."
"When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. Panouvong made no resistance. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said.In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng saying “when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending. The rest of the story is and sad because saeng misses her home in Vietnam"
".The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she wai’t be able to see the hibiscus .she is used to  going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant In conclusion the author concludes the story that way, because in the winter time she wai’t see  her plant.  "
"“How much?”. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up"
"For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply.“How much?”. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes.The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it"
"She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said.When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. “I’m glad you got it.In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life"
"Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags .A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think at se was wereing about it doing spring because she whent to wacth the geese fly in a u shape and she whent to see the plant grow but the snow don’t melt yet"
"Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery.In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver’s test. To Saeng her failing the driver’s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring"
" The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. Panouvong made no resistance. Panouvong said nothing.And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the “test” again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss"
".I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring the would have to start all over in growing this plant."
. The authoR ends the STORY this way because their trying To show that Saeng will be dedicated To the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nations flower 
"A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope .Saeng hod been hurt anddissappointed but in the end she had shown hope in the story Saeng failedher driving test"
" Panouvong made no resistance. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try keep her next plant"
" Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant.

She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes “saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"
" Panouvong said nothing. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home"
" And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng.I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she’ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good"
" Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.Mrs.Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner."
. The author concluded the story in the paragraph. She doesn’t want Saeng vows the whole room to herself where it’s quite when she is taking the test.
"Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus.It was like walking into another world.1. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply.Saeng will take the test in the spring when it’s not so cold. She likes it when the hibicus is budding they smell so good"
"“I know,” her mother said quietly. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan.“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said.  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine."
".The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, saeng was talking about how she failed the test, in which she wanted to retake. So, saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she shall take the test again."
" Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.In the story, “winter hibiscus”, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds he so much of her home. The reason why the author conclude the story with that saying was because it gave her a goal"
"“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.”. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions"
. At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.
".The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring."
".The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again."
"“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight.I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again"
" Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question.1."
"“What happened?” she asked, more gently.”.“How much?”.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng.In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited"
"When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently.A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “Let’s plant it, right now.The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles"
. I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.
" Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.”. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs.Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles"
. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she’s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She’s said  and does lots of fun things.
"“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.”.For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags ."
"Mrs.For a long moment Mrs. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket.Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags .The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam"
" “Where did you get it?”. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased.“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said.The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it"
"Mrs.“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her.“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus.She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test"
" Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. “Goodness, it’s past five. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased.“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously."
"Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands.One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said.“I’d love it,” Saeng said.This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey"
"For a long moment Mrs.Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again"
" Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too.”. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel.I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk"
" “I’m glad you got it. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness"
" “I’m glad you got it.“That’s all?” Mrs.”. “Goodness, it’s past five."
"For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”.In the story , “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too"
"”.Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng.“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.“What happened?” she asked, more gently.The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl"
" Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes.Mrs.The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea"
"It was like walking into another world. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery.“How much?”.The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination"
"For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner."
"“How much?”. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased.”. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply."
"“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.”. He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test"
" It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone."
"”. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered.And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue."
" Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? .Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket.The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles"
"Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng.“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “Goodness, it’s past five. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."
" Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her.“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled.When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it"
"Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.”.Mrs.Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam.In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home"
" Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel.“I’d love it,” Saeng said. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her.In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland"
. I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.
" The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Panouvong made no resistance.There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now"
. I think they think it will bring them luck
"She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. “Goodness, it’s past five. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said.“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously.The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test"
. Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better.
" It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said."
" And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. “Where did you get it?”.A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country"
" “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said.One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home"
" Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes.“That’s all?” Mrs. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it.The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings"
" She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes"
. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring.
" Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight.”. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now.”.The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it"
. The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well.
" “Let’s plant it, right now.A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers.“Nothing else.And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said"
" As Saeng walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs.Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags .I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy"
" Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said.“Then what else—?”.The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home"
".The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on."
"”. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner.1.The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it"
