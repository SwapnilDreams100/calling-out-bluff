" The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up.

Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up."
"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .During autumn, winter, and spring quarters of the academic year, the Maroon publishes every Tuesday and Friday..The CN Center attracted about 2,000 spectators, only about one third capacity, and despite encouraging pay per view sales, a teased second show in the spring of 2006 never materialized..Ross E.

So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  "
"The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success.

And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future."
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right.The Palm Springs School of Architecture is characterized by its adaptation to the desert's brutal climate..According to Whitesell, Paddison quotes Adorno's 1930 essay ""Reaktion und Fortschritt"" as saying ""Insofar as surrealist composing makes use of devalued means, it uses these as devalued means, and wins its form from the 'scandal' produced when the dead suddenly spring up among the living"" (Whitesell 2004, 107 and 118n18)..Edward William Osborne (January 5, 1845 - July 5, 1926) was the second bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Springfield..They are best friends of Homer Simpson and work with him at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening.The first part (considered spring) started in late May and finished by mid of July with a single match played by each participant against each other..It is a small town located between Holly Springs and Oxford on Highway 7..The scrap materials consist of bike sprockets, gears, spark plug, chain, sheet metal, wire spring, bearing, nut-bolts,pistons,connecting rods and MS pipe..Blackwood (also called Blackwood Springs) is an unincorporated community in Gordon County, in the U.S. state of Georgia.. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about."
"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly.It played from 1998-2000 at the Tucson Electric Park spring training complex..The Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) is a species of small air-breathing freshwater snail in the family Physidae..Village Theater invited the show to Washington state to continue developing the show as part of the Village Originals program in the spring of 2000..Spring Break is a 2011 comedy/road trip film.. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.” @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."
"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior.There is a natural spring about 200 yards from the school providing crystal clear drinking water..Dusty...

So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     "
"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life.She set her personal best (6374 points) in the heptathlon on 29 July 1995 at a meet in Colorado Springs..The Price/Wheeler House is a historic house located at 618 South 7th Street in Springfield, Illinois..In some applications, the shoes are applied by powerful springs, and held off by mechanical or electro-magnetic force..The play's West End and Broadway productions are directed by Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris; it features life-size horse puppets by the Handspring Puppet Company of South Africa, with ""horse choreography"" by Toby Sedgwick.. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     "
"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more.This site has spring fed peat meadows on chalk, a habitat formerly common but now rare..As of Spring 2018, the station is owned by Flood Communications and operates as a Telemundo affiliate as Telemundo Nebraska..The album was released on the Uni label (a subsidiary of MCA Records) in January 1970 simultaneously with a first single ""Colorado Springs Eternal"", and took its name from a song, ""Southern Comfort"", by Canadian folk duo Ian and Sylvia (Tyson), which eventually appeared as the final track on Second Spring..Sanford Springs is an unincorporated community in Cherokee County, Alabama, United States.. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."
" I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden.His study of the British monarchy and its future was published in spring 2014 and his book on Royal Ceremony and Regalia is to be published early 2015..Near Wickes is the Boggs Springs Youth Encampment of the American Baptist Association, a retreat of Missionary Baptist churches..Spatial variations during winter and spring tend to be incoherent as well..It grows up to 0.5 meters in height and produces pink flowers between June and October (early winter to mid spring) in its native range.. Without no friends just let in her mom"
" The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is.An important aspect of the formation of the parent offspring is the chromosome, which is a structure of DNA which contains many genes..From 1924 to 1926 Runyan was affiliated with John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas pastoring the Federated Church, and editing the Christian Workers' Magazine..During October for many years the annual ""Spring in the Valley"" weekend took place; it was one of Australia's largest wine and food festivals..Now: The Hits of Spring 2010 was released on Friday 10 September 2010.. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test."
"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring.The transmitter is located on Cheyenne Mountain amid other TV and FM towers for stations in the Colorado Springs-Pueblo market..Multi-leaf springs are widely used for the suspension of cars, trucks and railway wagons..The following spring, the town rebuilt the current hall with the same dimensions, headed by carpenter Theodore Ristin..The imagery springs from the depths of a fertile imagination, invoking psychedelic visions, ancient dreams, and idyllic natural environments.. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life."
"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam.Thermonema rossianum is a thermophilic and halophilic bacterium from the genus of Thermonema which has been isolated from a saline hot springs in from the Bay of Naples in Italy..Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, but it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, led to a nationwide ban on DDT for agricultural uses, and inspired an environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency..Sweet Springs is a city in Saline County, Missouri, along the Blackwater River..The amusement park was located at 9300 West 79th Street in Willow Springs.. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become..Many digital libraries, like IEEE Xplore, Scopus, the ACM Portal, Scopemed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Rayyan QCRI, Ejmanager and online library catalogs can export citations in this format..In the spring of 2003, KZMU began operating solely on wind power through Utah Power's Blue Sky Program, in which KZMU purchases blocks of power from wind farms in Oregon and Wyoming..Adi Jacobs struggled with injuries late in his career and missed a lot of rugby for the Sharks and the Springboks and his last game for the Springboks was on 30 July 2011 vs New Zealand in Wellington, aged 30..Manatee Spring is a first magnitude spring that flows directly into the Suwannee River by way of a short run (though it is the longest spring run feeding the Suwannee River)... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life.

Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test."
"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test.The first Native Foods Cafe opened in 1994 in Palm Springs, California..The company was acquired by Axel Springer in June 2016 for $242 million..Lady Washington was built in New York City in the spring of 1776 at the behest of General George Washington after he transferred his forces from Boston to New York..Early cases were associated with recent travel to Mexico; many were students who had traveled to Mexico for Spring Break..

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two.

That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle."
"The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it’s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng “cheep skip over live to you’re back she saw cheerfully” @CAPS1 it’s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to"

Saeng didn’t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won’t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories.

Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."
"The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.Cool Springs was a historic home located near Carvers Creek, Cumberland County, North Carolina..The episode, which was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Jim Reardon, sees Homer Simpson run for the job of Springfield's Sanitation Commissioner..He joined Colorado College in 1968, and was a Fulbright Lecturer in Mexico in 1966 through 1968, and Peru in 1971.In 1973 Bird and fellow Colorado College Professor Fred Sondermann were elected to city council of Colorado Springs on a ""Sensible Growth"" ticket..The film was a pilot for a television series which never materialized and it also followed the success of Goldie Hawn's movie, Private Benjamin, which itself spawned a television series in the spring of 1981..The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes."
"The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything’s going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her.KVRE (92.9 FM) is a radio station licensed to Hot Springs Village, Arkansas..The Terrace at Saint-Germain, Spring is a painting by English Impressionist painter, Alfred Sisley, completed in 1875..It succeeded the former Saskatoon Silver Springs riding and was first contested in the 2016 election..These adaptive maternal effects lead to phenotypes of offspring that increase their fitness..

"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”.Klastrup is currently (fall 2009) co-editing The International Handbook of Internet Research, with Jeremy Hunsinger and Matthew Allen, to be published by Springer Verlag late 2009..It is run every spring..Edward Kinney, (1859-1933), was an American luthier active in Springfield, Massachusetts..Tsotsobe was born in Kwa Magxaki, Port Elizabeth, and has played for and captained the South Africa women's national rugby union team, the Springboks, since their founding in 2004.. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."
"The story like this for mine reasons. First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two.The Wamesit Indians congregated in this area for thousands of years, and the land on which this tree grew on (which was high ground with an underground spring close by) was held as sacred to them as was the tree itself..It was demolished to make way for the MGM Springfield casino..Elected to the Colorado State Senate as a Republican in 2012, Hill represents Senate District 10, which encompasses Eastern Colorado Springs..Jason currently lives on Salt Spring Island, British Columbia with his wife Celeste.. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that."
"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months.It is a shrub with small, rather fleshy leaves and pink to lilac-colored flowers in early spring..In The Bronx, Dypiangco has directed and written a narrative short film entitled ""Clean"" which has screened at the Asian American International Film Festival, the Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films, the Hawaii International Film Festival and more..The Winterfox LoL team competed in the North American League of Legends Championship Series in for the 2015 Spring NA LCS split before being relegated and eventually disbanding..Flowers appear in spring and summer, having five pink petals, but one is very small.. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     "

"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country.Originally conceived on April 21, 1950 as a not-for-profit theatrical organization, the Springfield Municipal Opera Association transformed a 55-acre wheat field into an outdoor amphitheater..Denning (born December 1, 1992) is an American country music singer signed to Universal Music Group Nashville's Mercury Nashville branch, and has charted with his single ""David Ashley Parker from Powder Springs""..She didn't appear in the last two Tests of the series, and was not to play for the Springboks again..For many years, the station was owned by John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas.. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."
"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying.The Aquificaceae family are bacteria that live in harsh environmental settings such as hot springs, sulfur pools, and hydrothermal vents..Emerald Spring is a hot spring located in Norris Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park..He played with several Springbok players, both as a junior and at provincial cricket..More simply, meiotic drive is when one copy of a gene is passed on to offspring more than the expected 50% of the time.. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past."
"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world.It concluded with a performance by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band..The band started to write songs for the album towards the end of summer 2008, and finished it entirely in spring 2009..It serves numerous Chestnut Hill Academy and Springside School students daily..Nisan-years begins from the Spring season.."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .Steele Hills, are a ridge of hills, east of the Tres Alamos Wash valley and the Sulfur Springs Valley in Cochise County, Arizona..New editions are distributed every Monday and Thursday during the fall and spring school semesters..In late winter/early spring, the adult monarchs leave the Transvolcanic mountain range in Mexico for a more northern climate..2015 Spring North American League of Legends Championship Series (2015 Spring NA LCS) was won by Team SoloMid (TSM), with a roster of Dyrus, Santorin, Bjergsen, WildTurtle, and Lustboy, TSM's third split title..When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”."
"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion.Trusty attended Lakeside High School in Hot Springs Arkansas..His debut full-length novel, Ballistics, was published in spring 2013..The passive radiator resonates at a frequency determined by its mass and the springiness of the air in the enclosure..He made his debut for England in the 2012 Test series in India and made his ODI and Twenty20 International debuts on the same tour, before scoring his maiden Test century at his home ground of Headingley the following spring against New Zealand.. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."
" The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city.Within the state, the school is referred to as Lake Village or Lakeside Lake Village high school to distinguish itself from Lakeside High School in Hot Springs..The nearby Springfield Fen provides habitat for the rare Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake, which is known to be extant at only two other sites in Northwest Indiana..Eleven Hundred Springs was founded by Matt Hillyer (lead vocalist, guitar, primary songwriter), Steven Berg (bass), and Richie Vasquez (drums), in 1998..Sasha Springer-Jones (born March 17, 1978 in Port-of-Spain) is a track and field sprint athlete who competes internationally for Trinidad and Tobago.. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty."
"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .Zim was active in historic preservation in Saratoga Springs and founded Friends of Saratoga Battlefield..Alvord Hot Springs is a geothermal spring located near the southeastern corner of the state of Oregon in the United States..At the first-ever FINA Diving World Cup held in The Woodlands, Texas in 1979, Snode became World Cup Champion in the men's three-meters springboard event..Clear Creek Springs is an unincorporated community in Bell County, Kentucky, in the United States..This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."
"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1.It was established in 2006 as the Central European Journal of Medicine, co-published by Versita and Springer Science+Business Media..Traditionally, they lacked springs and seats, with the passengers having to sit on their haunches and withstand the jolts transmitted by the wheels..As Ronald Fisher noted, the male offspring will inherit the ornament while the female offspring will inherit the preference for said ornament, which can lead to a positive feedback loop known as a Fisherian runaway..His new musical Groundhog Day, based on the 1993 film, opened in London in 2016, winning his second Olivier Award, and opened on Broadway in spring 2017.. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   "

This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1."

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way.

Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way."
"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".In 1980, the Empress was featured on the picture sleeve of Bruce Springsteen's hit single ""Hungry Heart"", which depicts a photo of Springsteen standing near a phone booth on the Asbury Park boardwalk, with the hotel visible in the background..Chrysiptera springeri is a species of damselfish known by the common name Springer's demoiselle..Contact with the sperm is essential for the ovum to begin dividing, but because there is no fusion of the cells, the male contributes no genetic material to the offspring, which are essentially clones of the female..Until 2015, the conference proceedings were published by Springer..This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."
"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will.An article in the October 5, 1898 issue of Springfield, Missouri's The Leader-Democrat states: Henry Westmoreland is in from Beaver County, Oklahoma, which was formerly a part of the strip known as No-Man's-Land..Upon returning to Springfield, Ed's wife, Virginia, stated that ""crusty cur"" was not a good name for regular civilians..The shooting of John Geer occurred on August 29, 2013, in the Pohick Hills neighborhood of Springfield, Virginia..It was described by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is found in North America.. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy.

In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."
" I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive.It includes a large number of hut platforms, and two natural springs..Wangjing River, a rivulet flowing down from the eastern hills, runs through the middle of the town, serving as a natural spring..He planned to sell the NRA HQ in Washington D.C. and move it to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and to reduce the organization's political involvement..The archeological site is marked as Nevada Historical Marker 86 and is located within the Floyd Lamb Park at Tule Springs which is operated by the City of Las Vegas.. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life."
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was.They were a supporting band for The Offspring in their 2005 Warped Tour along with Send More Paramedics..Westbeach Recorders was a recording studio in Hollywood, California famous for recording punk rock groups, such as Bad Religion, NOFX, Rancid, The Offspring and Pennywise..It is located northwest of Saratoga Springs, which it borders, and students living in Greenfield attend schools of the Saratoga Springs City School District..The name derives from the mule, the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey, due to such a coin having two sides intended for different coins, much as a mule has parents of two different species..

"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination.Environmental Earth Sciences is an international multidisciplinary scientific journal published 24 times a year by Springer..Boys and girls track and field are offered in the spring..It was first described by Victor Gruschka Springer in 1988 and named in honor of the American ichthyologist Herbert Richard Axelrod..Marl Spring is a spring in San Bernardino County, California.. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  "
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year.It springs west of Hardert..In the spring of 1907 he asked Mr. George Hormel for a more responsible job..The address is 2860 Ponce de Leon Springs Road..Biotechnology Letters is a scientific journal of biotechnology published by Springer Science+Business Media..

If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."
"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her.Though they originated in California, from 1966 on, the Bauer family mainly resided in Springfield and is considered by many to be the anchor family and the moral compass to both the town and the show..He is known for his distinctive orange and black stripes, large eyes, a long chin, a springy tail, and his love of bouncing..The singer expresses her strong feelings of love to a man who treats her like a toy, thus providing the ""jack in the box"" simile, as she feels that in exchange of his love, she would gladly ""bounce on a spring"" like the aforementioned toy (but isn't so thrilled to do it without reciprocation)..She debuted her Spring 2016 Collection at New York Fashion Week in September 2015 to critical acclaim..

For example she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.” This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation."

"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home.Spring Brook Township is a township in Kittson County, Minnesota, United States..Service to Spring Garden Street ended in 1984 with the opening of the Center City Commuter Connection, which bypassed the Reading Terminal..Spring Garden station is the seventh busiest station on the Broad Street Line, with 10,000 riders a day..The company is headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts.. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."
" The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job.Iron Springs is a South Mountain populated place on Toms Creek (Monocacy River) west of Fairfield, Pennsylvania, that is near the location of the 1822 Maria Furnace..It stars Jed Prouty, Spring Byington, and Kenneth Howell..Jane Harber (born 11 November 1984) is an Australian actress who is best known from her role on television series Offspring as Zara Perkich..Sulfur Springs was platted in 1860, and named for a sulfur spring near the original town site.."
" The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back.Since 2007, the league has adopted a longer season that starts in the fall and ends in the spring..Spring soup is popular largely because it includes fresh ingredients not seen for a while by the consumer..Spring Valley Township is a township in McPherson County, Kansas, in the United States..Melinda Culea (born May 5, 1955 in Western Springs, Illinois) is an American film and television actress, who moved into acting after working as a model.. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test."
"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again.The Men's 1 meter springboard diving competition at the 2015 Summer Universiade in Gwangju was held on 6 July at the Nambu University International Aquatics Center..Wyoming Highway 370 is an unmarked state highway that runs east of Rock Springs, Wyoming from Interstate 80/U.S. Route 30 (exit 111) to the Rock Springs - Sweetwater County Airport..Trinity Springs is an unincorporated community in Mitcheltree Township, Martin County, in the U.S. state of Indiana..The team participated in the Women's Spring Football League in 2011 and 2012.. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."
" the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope.The band makes appearances at pep rallies, special occasions, and formerly in the annual spring VEISHEA celebration parade..Once in the spring and once in the fall, leaders of NFU convene in Washington, D.C., to talk with legislators about solutions to problems they are facing..Fat Tony is a gangster and the underboss of the Springfield Mafia..They published a 32-page catalog of CP/M and MS-DOS software, cover date Fall/Winter 1986, describing it as the second, the first having been the Spring issue.. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test."
"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story.Evan Golden lives in Coral Springs, Florida and came upon his entertainment career in a moment of serendipity..He was the co-founder, co-publisher and managing editor of Saratoga Wire, a full-service on-line newspaper serving Saratoga Springs, New York until May 2014..Tomocerus vulgaris is a species of elongate-bodied springtail in the family Tomoceridae..Each spring, the park hosts the annual Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival, as it has since 1933.. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."
" The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved.Spring High School is a public high school located in the Spring census-designated place in unincorporated Harris County, Texas, United States..In 1969 the plantation was sold and the land was turned into a private country club, Deep Springs Country Club..South Amherst is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area..Under Colorado Skies is a 1947 American Western film directed by R. G. Springsteen and written by Louise Rousseau.. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It’s explaining moments in time.It starred Ifan Huw Dafydd and Gwydion Rhys and was well received in a national tour in Spring 2018..Montrose is a historic mansion in Holly Springs, Mississippi, USA..It serves the Lindbergh/Morosgo neighborhood in southern Buckhead, and is a part-time terminus of the Red Line and the last transfer point for the Red (North Springs) and Gold (Doraville) rail lines..She was also a resident athlete at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado.. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is."
"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .Cool Spring was approximately ten miles away on Highway 23..The first two-story house to be built in Bath Springs, it contains seven rooms and two halls..As viewed from the Equator, the equinox Sun sets exactly due west in both spring and fall..Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church is a historic African Methodist Episcopal Church building in Springtown, Greenwich Township, Cumberland County, New Jersey, United States..” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it."
"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her.Since the spring of 2014 he began to be involved in the main team, which participates in the Uzbekistan Super League..Springdale Township is one of the twenty-six townships of Redwood County, Minnesota, United States..Vegetarian bee hoon is a Singaporean noodle dish which comprises vegetarian spring rolls, fried tofu skin, and mock meats made from gluten..The Russian Spaniel is a type of spaniel first standardized in 1951 in the Soviet Union after World War II by cross breeding English Cocker Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels and other spaniel breeds.. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test.Caldanaerobius fijiensis is a thermophilic, obligately anaerobic and spore-forming bacterium from the genus of Caldanaerobius which has been isolated from a hot spring in Fiji..Tele Finland quit all advertising and sales on April 1, 2006 but returned in the spring of 2007..When it was built in 1898, it was the tallest building in Colorado Springs..Taylor now lives on Salt Spring Island, BC, Canada, where he has completed the eleventh book in the Irish Country series.. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time.These appear between November and December (late spring to early summer) in its native range..Springston has a pub, dairy and a community hall all on Leeston Road..The Grade II race has been held annually since 1964 at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York..If it had not already been shut down, the paving of Wekiwa Springs Road (Orange County Bond Project 44) in the late 1920s spelled the demise of the railroad.. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."
"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.His songs were recorded by top performers, including Frank Sinatra, Bob Dylan,Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Perry Como, Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard and Dusty Springfield..OCF operates Spring Canyon (CO) and White Sulfur Springs (PA), Christian camps and conference centers serving active duty military, veterans, enlisted soldiers, and families along with Christian church organizations..Sully Springs is an unincorporated community in Billings County, North Dakota..From the spring of 2008, he became one of the umpires for the newly formed Indian Premier League including being based in Chennai, India in May 2008..- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."
"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up.These offspring usually identify themselves as Micronesians rather than Japanese, and constitute a sizeable minority in each of the territories' populace..Judson, also called Buchanan or Buchanans Springs, is an unincorporated community in Washington Township, Parke County, in the U.S. state of Indiana..Shadows Fall is an American heavy metal band from Springfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1995..In the spring of 2006, Paladin Press announced that it acquired the rights to 40 titles previously published or sold by Loompanics, including the works of Claire Wolfe, Eddie the Wire, and other popular Loompanics authors.. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test.In the following spring he showed great improvement, winning the Madrid Handicap and the Tetrarch Stakes before recording a decisive victory over a strong field in the Irish 2000 Guineas..Its boundaries are marked by West Cold Spring Lane (north), Greenspring Avenue (east), and Springhill Avenue (south)..Schubart's career was divided into two periods: the San Francisco period, spanning from 1953 to 1968, and the Salt Spring Island period, spanning from 1968 to 1995..It is the second largest park in the City of Springfield.. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "
"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise.After an earthquake in 1907, a spring formed in the mountains above the area..The protests inspired similar actions throughout the Arab world, known as the Arab Spring..The mouse squeak from Klaatu's first and second album was present here, followed by the sound of a springing mousetrap..It is also rumored that the Minotaur was in fact the offspring of King Minos but his unsightly and grotesque appearance was shameful to King Minos and was the reason why the Minotaur was banished under the pretext of inspiring fear and cannibalistic capabilities.. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started.After the Cave Spring Church was torn down, some of its materials were recovered for use in the new Verona church..Neosminthurus clavatus is a species of globular springtails in the family Sminthuridae..This was the first year that the pageant was held in Palm Springs, which would later host Miss Teen USA 2004 and Miss Teen USA 2006..Woodspring was, from 1983 until 2010, a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring.It was released as a single in Italy and Spain in the spring of 1999..In the spring of 185 1 Mr. Alsbach laid out a portion of his farm in lots and called the prospective village Scotch Hill, to commemorate its former occupant, Anderson, and his neighbor, McNaughton..The Beanpot Cycling Classic is a collegiate cycling race weekend, held near Boston each spring..Home games in the fall and spring are played at Alumni Field.. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home.In spring, the field is a colorful tapestry of flowers and grasses, some plots still having the wide range of plants that most meadows probably contained hundreds of years ago..There he has developed and taught an undergraduate course and collaborate on research projects with earth science faculty and researchers As of 2006, he was living on the Saltspring Island in British Columbia, Canada..The album includes production from Bink, Devo Springsteen, Hi-Tek, Neo da Matrix, Nottz, L.E.S., The Individualz and Swizz Beatz, the latter of whom also executive produced the album..Civic Memorial High School also produces a drama program, producing a fall play and spring musical every year.. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test."

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again. “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.Spring Hill High School is a public high school located in the city of Longview, Texas, in Gregg County, United States and classified as a 4A school by the UIL..After investing his remaining money in a bathhouse in Hot Springs, Arkansas, he settled in Sawtelle, California, where he died in the Union Soldier's Home..The 1902 Spring Hill Badgers football team represented the Spring Hill Badgers of Spring Hill College during the 1902 college football season..By spring 2014 the relaying work had reached the outskirts of Corwen and in October 2014 the new station at Corwen East saw its first passengers..” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.

"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again.

Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test."
" The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself .

Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story."
"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel.

He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season."

She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."
"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then.In the spring of 1942, the Aircraft Detection Corps volunteers received manila envelopes with a letter from L. E.

Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.Mattress Factory Lofts, site of the former Southern Spring Bedding factory, with some buildings built as far back as 1864..Caldimonas hydrothermale is a Gram negative, thermophilic and motile bacterium from the genus Caldimonas with a single polar flagellum which has been isolated from a natural thermal spring in Tozeur in Tunisia..Xipu was born in Payneville, Springs; his father was originally from the outskirts of Queenstown in the Eastern Cape..Springfield was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance with the song in 1983.."

"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring.Parents of some species deliver trophic eggs directly to their offspring, whereas some other species simply produce the trophic eggs after laying the viable eggs; they then leave the trophic eggs where the viable offspring are likely to find them..It was described by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is found in North America..The house was later owned by J.

This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."
" It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph.

In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."
"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country.Bismarck is a rural unincorporated community between Hot Springs and Caddo Valley, centered around the intersection of State Hwy 7 and State Hwy 84 in Hot Spring County, Arkansas, United States..It includes the town of Gunnedah and surrounding villages of Curlewis, Breeza, Carroll, Mullaley, Emerald Hill, Tambar Springs and Kelvin..The community is east of Red Sulfur Springs..The diplomat Sir Cecil Spring Rice, British Ambassador to the United States from 1912 to 1918, was the son of Hon..

This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower.Outbuildings include a stone spring house, a large wood-frame barn, constructed about 1900, and several wood-frame outbuildings including a corncrib, a wagon shed, three frame wood sheds, two tractor sheds, and a chicken house..Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, rivers, freshwater marshes, and freshwater springs..The orchestra performs spring and fall concerts each year at Merkin Hall in Manhattan, as well as offering programs for the community, workshops, and lectures on Chinese music..Though they are related to the general wave in innovative design in midcentury California, the relative isolation of this small town, the focus on a few issues, and the large percentage of contributing architects who worked almost exclusively in Palm Springs lead to an identifiable approach to architecture that may be called the Palm Springs School..

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring.The village of Firsilla formed around a spring of the same name..Upon returning to the cabin in Spring, Sam finds his little family had been slaughtered just 10 days before his return..Washington's earliest residents relied on natural springs but this came to be inadequate as the city's population grew..Damien Beebe, known professionally as DJ Day is a DJ, producer and musician from Palm Springs, California.. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."
"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store.He planned to sell the NRA HQ in Washington D.C. and move it to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and to reduce the organization's political involvement..These are produced from early winter to mid spring (June to October In Australia)..The Institute opened in Spring, 1972..It was launched in Spring 2006, and started broadcasting in late 2007.. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."

G. Springsteen and written by Robert Creighton Williams.. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."
"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ .Titled as the follow-up to the band's commercially and critically successful 1972 album Slade Alive!, the performances on Slade Alive, Vol. 2 were taken from the band's Autumn 1976 tour of the United States and their Spring 1977 UK tour..It also owns the Colorado Springs Business Journal..She has been commissioned to sculpt several Congressmen and historical figures, such as Abraham Lincoln at the Abraham Lincoln Museum and Washington County Courthouse in Springfield, Kentucky, and Giulio Cesare Graziani in the Italian Air Force Museum in Rome..Mainit Hot Spring and Rizal dam are the top tourists spots everybody could visit....and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."
"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet.This species spawns in the early spring and is an obligatory freshwater fish..In Lusitanian and Celtic polytheism, Borvo (also known variously as Bormo, Bormanus, Bormanicus, Borbanus, Boruoboendua, Vabusoa, Labbonus or Borus) was the Celtic God of Minerals and healing deity associated with bubbling spring water..Ozark FC is an amateur soccer team based in Springdale, Arkansas that currently competes in National Premier Soccer League..Their offices are located in Alice Springs, Northern Territory..

In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."

"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost.They do mainly vegetative growth called fronds in spring and summer time, while they switch into a dormant phase represented by turions in autumn and winter due to nutrition starvation and freezing temperature..It covers the Monmouth County municipalities of Avon-by-the-Sea, Belmar, Bradley Beach, Brielle, Farmingdale, Howell Township, Lake Como, Manasquan, Sea Girt, Spring Lake, Spring Lake Heights, and Wall Township and the Ocean County municipalities of Lakewood Township and Point Pleasant..At Nant-y-Mynydd it is joined by several small springs from Mynydd Ddu, and finally itself joins the River Alyn at Pontblyddyn, Flintshire..Entomobrya sinelloides is a species of slender springtails in the family Entomobryidae.. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown.East of Interstate 35 Exit 1 Thackerville, Ok 73459Over the last couple of decades, bodies have been discovered in the springs..In 2015, Shadyac began teaching film at the University of Colorado Boulder, beginning with that year's Spring semester, Shadyac now teaches film at the University of Memphis..It was restricted to these trickles when the flowing spring water was channelized and impounded..It produces a pale blue flower in early spring..

The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam.

" In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again.

But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time.

"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength.

Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up."
" The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant.

The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can.

"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding.It is published by Springer Science+Business Media on behalf of the Operations Research Society of China..Spring Bank Farm is a large house, built in 1880 near Frederick, Maryland in the small community of Harmony Grove..Although observations of steam devils are generally quite rare, hot springs in Yellowstone Park produce them on a daily basis..It was one of a series of offensives, known as the Kaiserschlacht, launched by the Germans in the spring and summer of 1918..

While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."

It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom"
" In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on.Travelers along the trail gave the springs its name..Scenic Hot Springs is a privately owned natural hot spring in Washington state that is closed to the public..DeLanda was previously a visiting professor at the University of Southern California School of Architecture, where he taught an intensive two-week course in the spring 2012 term on self-organization and urbanity; adjunct associate professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation from 1995 to 2006; and adjunct professor at Cooper Union's Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture..Pseudophoxinus zeregi, also known as the Levantine spring minnow, is a species of ray-finned fish in the Cyprinidae family.. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again.Barker House was once a hotel in Manitou Springs, Colorado in the Manitou Springs Historic District..It is the high school for Manitou Springs School District 14..Previously named Coral Springs Cablevision, the Coral Springs portion of the company was purchased by Schurz Communications in 1978 who changed the name to Advanced Cable Communications..Cold Spring Township was erected in 1857, taking its name from the cold springs in the area.. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "
"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around.Calvada Springs is an unincorporated community in Inyo County, California..Sullivan was born in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1892 and graduated from Cornell University in 1914..Ben-Menahem is the sole author of a 6-volume, 6000 pages treatise: Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences published in 2009 by Springer Verlag..The museum is backed and supported by the Springfield African American History Foundation.. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."

"The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader.

The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom."
 because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place

In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€� so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right."
 I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up
"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country.In spring and summer, a troop of white-winged fairywrens has a brightly colored older male accompanied by small, inconspicuous brown birds, many of which are also male..A blynx is the hybrid offspring of a bobcat and a Canada lynx, two closely related species in the genus Lynx..Also on the property is a contributing stone spring house..The East Spring Street Historic District is a national historic district located at New Albany, Indiana..

"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs.The river's significance is in the thirty natural springs that add an average of 300 million gallons (1,135 million liters) of warm water to the river every day..Garrison is part of the Springfield, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area..Spring Gulch is the primary training ground for the Nordic team at CRMS..Springer had said that he could not host due to other commitments.. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying.According to Gahan, the new Soulsavers album will be released in spring 2015..Alice Springer Fleisher Liveright (December 18, 1882 - February 18, 1958) was a Philadelphia social worker who served as State Secretary of Welfare in the 1930s..Clear Spring is a town in Washington County, Maryland, United States..Originally christened the Spring Branch Community Coliseum, it was renamed in 1992 for local basketball coaching icon Don Coleman..

"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that.The series premiered on October 26, 2010 and featured the now defunct auction house Gallery 63 in Sandy Springs, Georgia, located on Roswell Road immediately north of the Atlanta city limit..Neosilurus gloveri, commonly known as Dalhousie catfish, is a species of catfish native to Dalhousie Springs in Central Australia..He was signed by the Carolina Panthers of the NFL as an undrafted free agent in the spring of 2000, then chosen by the Memphis Maniax in the XFL Draft in the fall of 2000..The company has offices in Lexington, Kentucky, Elkton, Maryland, Grand Prairie, Texas, Saratoga Springs, New York, and Ocala, Florida.. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things."

The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace."
"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother.On March 2, 2004, it was released to DVD as a bonus special, along with It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown! and Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown..The 7th Canadian Infantry Division was an infantry division of the Canadian Army, mobilized in the spring of 1942 and assigned for home defense within Atlantic Command, during World War II..The celebration of the Trndez is pagan in origin and is originally connected with sun/fire worship in ancient pre-Christian Armenia, symbolizing the coming of spring and fertility..Springsteen's only double album, The River was produced by Jon Landau, Springsteen, and bandmate Steven Van Zandt..

I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.An annual spring fundraiser keeps KLRC going throughout the year..It was formed in 1958, and became an independent non-profit organization in 1973, headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado..Since that time many thousands of pilgrims to Lourdes have followed the instruction of Our Lady of Lourdes to ""drink at the spring and bathe in it""..It hosts many events year round like spring/fall camporees and camp Alaska in the winter, but is most known for its summer program Camp Frontier which is very popular and one of the best programs in the area..” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."

To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test.Snead, who preferred if people called him by his middle name Carlyle, was born in Hot Springs, Virginia..The red flowers appear between early winter and early spring..The International Journal of Hindu Studies is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Springer Science+Business Media..Hunter was born in Petrolia, Ontario, but grew up in Oil Springs, Ontario, and was one of three brothers, with Dave and Dale, to play in the NHL.. “She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. “This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2."

She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined.It was established in 2009 and is published by Springer Science+Business Media..The spring season would start in the middle of January and end in the first week of July..Salcedo qualified for the women's 100 m breaststroke at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by clearing a FINA B-standard entry time of 1:12.08 from the Spanish Spring Open Championships in Cadiz..The women's synchronized 3 meter springboard competition of the diving events at the 2015 Pan American Games will be held on July 13 at the CIBC Pan Am/Parapan Am Aquatics Center and Field House in Toronto, Canada.. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up."
"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds.

When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."
" The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again.

That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother.

Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test.""

She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1.Hostellerie De Hamert is a restaurant in Wellerlooi in the Netherlands, most famous for its asparagus dishes in spring..From a limited number of offspring, his son Future Character was his top earner with $534,426..After winning the AJC Breeders Plate in his spring debut, he had wins in the Golden Slipper and AJC Sires Produce Stakes and second place, defeated by a nose, in the AJC Champagne Stakes..The Building will be used to host Kingsway Park High School until 2012 when a new building will be built on the former Springhill High School site, Turfhill Road..

"In the story , “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring.

Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken..This is done during the spring when snow is melting and river ice is breaking up..The Vicarage built in 1889 is an historic house located at 150 Circle Drive, in DeFuniak Springs, Florida in the United States..There are also newer events springing up and attracting increasing numbers, including the Highlander Mountain Marathon which began in 2007 and is held in April at a Scottish location 'within a 2 hour drive of Inverness'..He was invited to practice with the major league club for 2014 spring training, but did not make the Opening Day roster.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on."
"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea.Nearby to Ruthven was the community of Schuster, which was once the location of the Wilcox Mineral Springs Resort..Its southern shore was marshy, but the northern end of the island (toward Richfield Springs) had trees and vegetation..Altogether six aircraft of the Springbok design were built but none entered service with the armed forces..The venue alternates each year between Guernsey and Jersey: in Guernsey it is usually held at The Track, and in Jersey at Springfield Stadium.. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did."
"The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”, says her mother.It depicts a tumultuous season in the career of veteran New York Yankees first baseman Jack Elliot, who is traded to the Chunichi Dragons of the Japanese Central League during Spring Training, and forced to contend with overwhelming expectations and cultural differences during the Dragons' run at the pennant..It uses some new architecture design like the bytecode injection (with ASM ObjectWeb tool), IoC, POJO and can be embedded in OSGi bundles or other frameworks (Spring, Eclipse plugins, etc.)..Established in 1871, Pennine Spring was produced by Ben Shaws of Huddersfield..These are produced from early winter to mid spring (June to October In Australia).. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself “Then i will take the test again.”     "
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again.Ellis arrived in 1872 after training in New York, and was the first engineer employed by the Springfield..Spring 2009 was the release of the 2005 recorded No Forest Fire: Tommy Mars together with The Band From Utopia members Bruce Fowler, Walt Fowler, Kurt McGettrick, Larry Klimas (not from TBFU), Arthur Barrow, and Vinnie Colaiuta..Agawam sits on the western side of the Connecticut River, directly across from Springfield, Massachusetts..Trinity Springs is an unincorporated community in Mitcheltree Township, Martin County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years."
"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.His first career national event win on the professional level would come two years later on April 23, 2017 at the NHRA SpringNationals in Baytown, Texas, defeating Jeg Coughlin, Jr. in the Pro Stock finals..Cacoosing is an unincorporated community in Spring Township in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States..A simple example is where spring load applies a reducing force so that the output pressure is reduced..It was completed in the late spring of 2010 and after a period of testing opened at the end of June..” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful."
" He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again.Every year, migratory birds travel some or all of this distance both in spring and in fall, following food sources, heading to breeding grounds, or traveling to overwintering sites..Lee played his first professional season with their Class A (Short Season) Eugene Emeralds in 1982, and his last season with the Triple-A affiliates of the Cleveland Indians (Colorado Springs Sky Sox) and Minnesota Twins (Portland Beavers) in 1992..After Boston released him in spring training of 1986, he played on the independent San Jose Bees of the California League that season..Solidago spectabilis grows in moist habitat, including bogs, meadows, seeps, streambanks, hot springs, and wet areas on alkali flats.. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants."
"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed.The flowers appear in spring and summer, in various colors from yellow to purple..Springston in 2013 had a growing primary school with over 200 students and was about to grow with four new classrooms approved to be built that year..In spring and probably into summer 1864 Fort Henning was constructed..In spite of efforts to control costs by closing some stores, Schaak Electronics filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the spring of 1975.. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that’s how the girl feel.Aguaje de Las Berendas, or Antelope Springs, is a spring in located on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, at the foot of the foothills of the Diablo Range, in Merced County, California..In the 2011 census, Spring Creek had a population of 354 people..The Orange Mound Spring is part of the Mammoth Hot Springs area of the park..The genial Foley closed each show from the Jewell Theater in downtown Springfield with a ""song of inspiration"" or a recitation from his Keepsake Album; and his sign-off was ""Goodnight mama, goodnight papa"", before walking into the audience to shake hands as the credits rolled.. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did."
"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced.He was an early member of Bruce Springsteen's backing group, the E Street Band, and contributed to the first three Springsteen albums, and again on the 1992 album Human Touch..Located north of Eureka Springs, the small town has been featured in movies for its picturesque scenery..It was established in 1992 and is published ten times per year by Springer Science+Business Media..Compression results in a transfer plate under the arming plug pressing downwards onto a belleville spring which inverts, flipping the firing pin into the detonator, which triggers the adjacent explosive booster and main explosive charge.. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   "
" I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.In some applications, the shoes are applied by powerful springs, and held off by mechanical or electro-magnetic force..Sohna is known for its hot springs and Shiva temple..Schools and programs include Spring Lake Park High School, Westwood Middle School, Westwood Intermediate School, Northpoint Elementary, Park Terrace Elementary, Woodcrest Elementary Spanish Immersion, The Lighthouse School, Spring Lake Park Online Learning, Early Childhood Center, and District Services Center..The trio, who formed in spring 2006 and signed with I Scream Records shortly thereafter, released their first full-length album New England is Sinking on April 24, 2007..  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time."
"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself.Central Colorado is home to the state's two largest cities, Denver and Colorado Springs..With a fleet of sixty ships, George of Antioch blockaded the Bariot harbor and besieged Grimoald for months from Spring to August, when the prince finally gave in..Semi-elliptical springs were equipped on the front end, along with torque arms..The Eliphas Buffett House is a historic house located at 159 West Rogues Path in Cold Spring Harbor, Suffolk County, New York.. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story."
"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph.Warm Springs is a city in Meriwether County, Georgia, United States..Since dogs have greater genetic variability than other domesticated animals the number of possible breeds is vast with new crosses constantly occurring, from these both selected and random crosses may come new breeds should offspring reliably breed true to type..He was also in the original cast of the Broadway musical Spring Awakening, and has since appeared in films such as Hamlet 2 (2008), Taking Woodstock (2009), Cavemen (2013), and 21 & Over (2013)..In 1981, the first COMDEX/Spring was held in New York City.. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time."
"In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers.Cheerleading also sometimes use spring floors..Sandy Denny and Trevor Lucas left Fairport Convention at the end of 1975 and Denny embarked on Rendezvous in the spring of 1976..Compression results in a transfer plate under the arming plug pressing downwards onto a belleville spring which inverts, flipping the firing pin into the detonator, which triggers the adjacent explosive booster and main explosive charge..The Kilukeni were springboard for most of the major factions that battled for control of Kongo during its civil war.. At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."
" I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.There are some temples, springs, and underground rivers in the village of Girijati near Parangtritis..The first edition was published Spring/Summer 1991..In 1867, he founded the R. M. Rose Co. Distillery, also known as the Mountain Spring Distillery, in Vinings, Georgia, a then-small community twelve miles north of Atlanta..The Hagerman Mansion is a historic house located at 610 North Cascade Avenue in Colorado Springs, Colorado.."
"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond.Forbes and Wallace was an American department store chain based in Springfield, Massachusetts..Marney was a 19-year-old Motor Machinist's Mate, second class, from Springfield, Massachusetts..The News-Sun primarily serves Springfield and Urbana, in southwestern Ohio..The disadvantages of self-fertilized offspring (inbreeding depression) are now thought to be largely due to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive mutations; and the fitness advantages of outcrossed offspring are thought to be largely due to the heterozygous masking of such deleterious mutations.. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."
 I think they think it will bring them luck
"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming.It is in the northern part of Colorado Springs, Colorado..The San Francisco Giants also played at the ballpark, during spring training in 1964..Lithia Springs is assigned the United States Postal Service zip code of 30122..West Siloam Springs is a town in Delaware County, Oklahoma, United States..

Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese.

When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again.

"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test.It is the largest artesian spring in the world and the site of the oldest commercial tourist attraction in Florida..Spring Valley is one of two high schools in the East Ramapo Central School District (ERCSD)..Sminthurides bifidus is a species of globular springtail in the family Sminthurididae..The springs took its name from Mr. Glenn.. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times.On July 26, 2005 the German woman, Frieda Springer-Beck, agreed to an out-of-court settlement after a long series of inconclusive court appearances dating back to 1993..The Writing Assessment took place in the fall, and the GHSGT in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies occurred in the spring of the eleventh grade..These flashlights can also be distinguished by the technique used to store the energy: a spring, a flywheel, a battery or a capacitor..Chosea Springs, also known as Chosa, Joseph Springs, Hannatown, Hickory Springs, or Hickory Town, is an unincorporated community in Calhoun County, Alabama, United States..

Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "

"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it.Bourletiella viridescens is a species of springtail..The general sound of the album is reminiscent of a slightly ""harder"" Bruce Springsteen, and the heavy use of harmonica would be a distinguishing factor of the Houserockers for several albums to come..They play at the Cadet Ice Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado..First performed by Theater South in 1993, it offers a comic view of parents through the eyes of their teenage offspring..

"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well.The characteristic feature of the Chapman strut is a long upright strut combining a coil spring and shock absorber, with a universal-jointed drive shaft itself forming the lower link of the suspension..Soda Spring Valley is a valley in the U.S. state of Nevada..She was one of the last offspring of the leading sire Nureyev, who died in 2001..He was awarded an ""Honorary Degree Doctor of Letters, honoris causa"" at the 98th Spring Convocation of St. Thomas University in Fredericton, New Brunswick on May 18, 2008.. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."
"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy.Every spring in Downtown Orlando, the Florida Music Festival showcases more than 250 unsigned bands and solo artists of all genres for the attending music industry professionals, on 15 indoor and outdoor stages..This property was acquired in 2007 and 2008 under the Florida Forever program, with additional money from Marion County and help from The Nature Conservancy, Silver Springs Working Group, and the Department of Environmental Protection..The district operates five elementary schools (Whitfield, Cornwall Terrace, Shiloh Hills, Green Valley, Spring Ridge), two junior high schools (Wilson West Middle School, Wilson Southern Middle School), and Wilson High School..Barentsz wanted to stop for the winter and continue in the spring, but Nay decided that the fleet should return home.. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring.It sponsors a number of activities including field trips, a spring wildflower workshop, and a wildflower photo contest..The springs are rich in sodium carbonate, iron, magnesium, and sodium hydroxide..With a total installed capacity of 1,292 MW, the mix of energy production of Cameroon consists of 57% of hydraulic power source, 21% of thermal springs in the gas, 10% of heat source to light fuel oil and 13% of heat source to heavy fuel oil..The park is popular with campers and local residents for its activities on the Frio River and the dances held nightly during the spring and summer..

So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready."

"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “..

One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."
