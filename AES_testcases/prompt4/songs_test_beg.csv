"Do I dare speak to him?.I'll march my band out,   I'll beat my drum,   And if I'm fanned out,   Your turn at bat, sir..Only to do   What can be done..[Chorus]      Freedom from the darkness   Freedom from the violence   Freedom from the hate   Freedom from the fear   Freedom from the hunger   Freedom from the forgiveness   Freedom from the past   Freedom from the mistakes      [Chorus]      Tell the people now   Freedom, freedom   What we all need is freedom in our hearts   Freedom, freedom   What we all need is freedom in our hearts.He's brung an agenda   And he's got a place to put it   What would he do without you?.In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test."
"Get off my ass you wee bitty fuck   If I pull out the claymore you're shit outta luck   Who's that girl, that pretty young thing   After I fuck her she'll get up and sing      Aye aye aye, sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye   Aye aye aye, the blarney stone brings a tear to me eye      Down to the pub for a two shilling ale   The bread on the counter is going stale   If I don't get some fresh bread soon   Gonna punch you in your face and bark at the moon      Aye aye aye, sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye   Aye aye aye, the blarney stone brings a tear to me eye      Ain't got no girl 'cause I haven't the time   Got too many other things on me mind   Patty was nice she was pale and cute   But I threw her away like an old piece of fruit      Aye aye aye, sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye   Aye aye aye, the blarney stone brings a tear to me eye      Got ooze in my pores my feet are all wet   Got mold in my ears but I ain't dead yet   Got stones in me bladder got a crack in me head   When patty starts cryin' this is what I said      Aye aye aye, sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye   Aye aye aye, the blarney stone brings a tear to me eye.I gave you my heart and you only turned away,   So tell me baby, what's going to make you stay..Hey don't you think it's time to say?.Straight down, you fallin you fallin straight down so fast your skin in crawling   Straight down, you fallin you fallin straight down so fast your skin is crawlin   You fallin so fast, you see your whole life flash, your balls jump up your ass in a quick   Dash, you get whiplash, the shit's so fast on your bitch ass, and it don't stop till the   Shit crash   [Chorus (2x)]   It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it (come ride The Tempest)   You got that feelin in you, so jump up, jump on it (Jump on it)   It's somthing wicked for you so get on, get on it (Let's ride The Tempest)   We got that ticket for you, so jump up, jump on it..You've been busted in mid-flight   Whenever you're puzzled you just   Put on your big red light   Chaka's rap:   You know I know what they mean now   When they say that you're all dressed up   And nowhere to go   Mickey really I been tryin to talk to you   All night I've been lookin at you   And lookin at you   And tryin to talk and talk   But you just don't listen   You're on some eternal flight   I just can't seem to make you make sense   Mickey, Mickey   Repeat chorus   Ad lib to fade.The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  "
"Somewhere out there on that horizon   Out beyond the neon lights   I know there must be somethin' better   But there's nowhere else in sight   It's survival in the city   When you live from day to day   City streets don't have much pity   When you're down, that's where you'll stay   In the city, oh, oh..Don't cry now, don't you cry, don't you cry anymore..Chorus.Dream, dream dream dream, dream, dream dream dream   When I want you in my arms,   When I want you and all your charms   Whenever I want you, all I have to do, is   Dream, dream dream dream      When I feel blue in the night,   And I need you to hold me tight   Whenever I want you, all I have to do, is   Dream, dream dream dream      I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine,   Any time, night or day   Only trouble is, gee wiz,   I'm dreamin' my life away      I need you so that I could die,   I love you so, and that is why   Whenever I want you, all I have to do, is   Dream, dream dream dream, dream      I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine,   Any time, night or day   Only trouble is, gee wiz, I   'm dreamin' my life away      I need you so that I could die,   I love you so, and that is why   Whenever I want you, all I have to do, is   Dream, dream dream dream (repeats out).Out of purgatory   Unto victory   We shall overcome   The war they staged   Through unyielding power   In the darkest hour   They will retreat      [Chorus]   Gods of war   Devastation   Gods of war   End creation now!.The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle."
"Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doing,   This life I'm pursuing,   The odds of me loosing..What are you takin'?.This town is nuts, my kind of place   I don't want to leave   I don't never, never, never, never want to leave..Still can't shake you off....I have never been,   Never been somebody to hold on to..The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam"
"What's true, hey way?.Differently....Slaying the weak,   Ethnic elimination..And I can't understand   Why you're doing these things to me      There've been too many tears falling,   And there've been too many hearts   Breaking in two   Remember what we had together,   Believing it would last forever..So, all you got to do is-uh   Just let me know and I'll (ah, come back) come running back..The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."
"When I'm with you a chain reaction   Like a rush of satisfaction   Suddenly coming over me      Your eyes telling me that you hold the key   The key to unlock my fantasies   Baby this is where I want to be      My heart is beating so hard it's frightening   Feels like I'm hit by lightening   Every time I watch you move      You're so in tune with your body   And I can see that no one else will do   Cause I'm so into you      Alabao, you got the touch   Alabao, you got the motion   Alabao, just can't hold back any more   Alabao, you lift me up   Alabao, you knock me down   Alabao, you're the one that I adore      You can take care of my affliction   Satisfy my addiction   You know what you have to do   When your body wants my affliction   You take me in a new direction   One where there's only you and me      And then we reise to the moment   And I can feel your love all around me   Now it's time to give it all      Alabao, you got the touch   Alabao, you got the motion   Alabao, just can't hold back any more   Alabao, you lift me up   Alabao, you knock me down   Alabao, you're the one that I adore      Just one look in your eyes and   I'm in heaven   There's so much that   I want I go insane   Take me here, make me yours now and forever   I can take all the pleasure and the pain      Alabao, you got the touch   Alabao, you got the motion   Alabao, I can't hold back any more   Alabao, you lift me up   Alabao, you knock me down   Alabao, you're the one that I adore      Alabao, you got the touch   Alabao, you got the motion   Alabao, oh oh oh   Alabao, you lift me up   Alabao, you knock me down   Alabao, you're the one, one that I adore      Alabao   Alabao   Alabao   Alabao.Well, you were my favorite D.J.,   Since I can't remember when..The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind   The answer is blowin' in the wind.Drank a beer, felt the chill of fall..Poison Ivy   Whoa But everybody knows, don't ya know, don't ya know?.The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   "
"The lake mirrored her beauty sweet..Hakuna Matata..I seen you walk along the riverside   I seen you walk along at ease   And in the air I feel a silence   It whispers perfect on the breeze   And there's a voice that keeps me company   It takes me closer to the stream   And in the break of any suffering   It makes me feel like there's no pain   Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer   To the dream..Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep   They just lie there and they die there   Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?.When you can't sleep and you're still up,   I get the ball and I'm like... You can't get a...   You probably got strip... No reason to trip   I grab like....“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter."
"'twas a token of ebony color..No one had rights or a vote but the king,   Infact you might say he was fairly right wing..Listen to the market-place sing!.I love you, I love you..We get to be, a ripple in the water   We get to be a rock that's thrown   We get to be a boy on the bridge   Standing over the reservoir   See the water lap along the shore line   The buried forest of a man made lake   Cemeteries are laying underneath it   Your heart like a dam when it breaks..The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels."
"Solo   You try   And give it all you have to give   So many people don't know how to forgive   Baby that aint us..And after all is said and done,   To think that I'm the lucky one..Well I came running when I got the news that you were leaving..Music do!.How can I be lost   In remembrance I relive   How can I blame you   When it's me I can't forgive?.The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  "

Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready."
"So here we are tonight,   You and me together   The storm outside, the fire is bright   And in your eyes I see   What's on my mind   You've got me wild   Turned around inside   And then desire, see, is creeping   Up heavy inside here   And know you feel the same way   I do now      Now let's make this an evening   Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight   Stay here with me, love, tonight   Just for an evening   When we make   Our passion pictures   You and me twist up   Secret creatures   And we'll stay here   Tomorrow go back to being friends      Go back to being friends   But tonight let's be lovers,   We kiss and sweat   We'll turn this better thing   To the best   Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss   Tangled tongues and lips,   See me this way   I'm turning and turning for you   Girl, just tonight      Float away here with me   An evening just wait and see   But tomorrow go back to your man   I'm back to my world   And we're back to being friends   Wait and see me,   Tonight let's do this thing   All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours   On our way here   Tomorrow go back to being friends      Go back to being friends   Tonight let's be lovers, say you will   And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love   A thing or two I have to say here   Tonight let's go all the way then   Love I'll see you,   Just for this evening   Let's strip down, trip out at this   One evening starts with a kiss   Run away      And tomorrow   Back to being friends   Lovers, love, lovers   Just for tonight, one night, love you   And tomorrow say goodbye.Someday I'll wish upon a star   And wake up where the clouds are far behind me..Somebody told me once, that pain is a game we all gotta play,   But while am I in overtime... every other day..There's a sky in the east   Over pyramids at Giza   Where there once lived a girl   She ruled the world   Then down the nile   He came with a smile   He was the king   She was the queen   Under the moonlight   Your eyes won't believe   What your mind can't concieve      Oooh   Nights over Egypt   Nights over Egypt   Nights over Egypt   Incense and myrrh   And girls that swirl   To the music   Nights over Egypt      Women fellahin   Wear veils to been seen   By no one   Take a caravan across   The sudan   Saharan fagade   Is just a mirage   Oasis in the sand   Where life once began   Under the moonlight   Your eyes won't believe   What your mind can't concieve   Nights over Egypt   Nights over Egypt   Nights over Egypt   Nights over Egypt.Jump on it!).The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes."
"Oh girl   I looked you over once or twice   I think that you are very nice   And you're just meant for me   Oh girl   I think you got a messed up mind   But if you will take the time   Baby I can set you free   Well I'm not trying to be   What I am not   But I think what you need   Is what I got   Girl I'm no philosopher   But I can offer you that cure   To mend your broken heart   I know that you are not blind   I know you see my messed up mind   I bet you see my broken heart too   So won't you   Bring your heart and your mind   That's out on the run   Fuse them with my broken heart   In my mind   We'll be one   Girl I looked you over once or twice   I think that you are very nice   And you're just meant for me   Girl I think you got a messed up mind   Now that you know yours is just like mine   Baby, won't you set me free.Thus making the story itself real, true and a real story, a true story, is non-fiction      Our story begins in a dark place..Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say goodbye      Feel so bad baby, oh it hurts me   When I think of how you love and desert me   I'm the broken-hearted toy you play with      You got me going, I need you baby   I can't let go and I want you baby   I gotta have all your love   I can't let go      Though I'm just one of your lovers   And I know there are so many others   You do something strange to me baby      You got me going, I need you baby   I can't let go and I want you baby   I gotta have all your love   I can't let go      Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say goodbye   I know that it's wrong and I should be so strong   But the thought of you gone makes me want to hold on      You got me going, I need you baby   I can't let go and I want you baby   I gotta have all your love   I can't let go      You got me going, I need you baby   I can't let go and I want you baby   I gotta have all your love   I can't let go      I can't let go   I can't let go   I can't let go.We got the Dogbeats   Oh yeah the Dogbeats huh?.Love came and hit me   Straight on the lips   The longer we're kissin'   The better it gets, and baby that's all right   You got me standing beside myself   You know it ain't like me   It's like I'm somebody else   But baby that's all right      You're not the man I was lookin' for   You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more   Now that I got you, it feels so good   I don't wanna let you go      I plead guilty babe, of this terrible crime   You been lovin' me all of this time   I must've been blind   What's gonna happen?.The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage."
"I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you   I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you   I see you la la la la la la la la la la la la I see you      Sun smiling sun through the cave of your hair   Wind washing tulips out of space sitting there   I love you   At your door second floor first world war   I love you   Who listens   Tell your friend I'm aware that she care   Who listens   Green specks bright spiraling out in the sky   Catch my eye turn my head have to look don't know why      I see you   Everywhere behind your hair over there   I see you   I see you though your eyes can tell lies I sympathize,   I see you   Sun smiling sun through the cave of your hair   Wind washing tulips out of space sitting there   I love you      I see you   Everywhere behind your hair over there   I see you   I love you at your door second floor first world war   I love you   I love you   I love you   I love you   I love you.Uh Mr. Smith, Mr Smith, Mr Smith   Uh Mr Smith, it's the bomb y'knowhutI'msayin?.My favorite bar's in view   Work there a day or two just to cover my tab   Other than that, it ain't cost me a dime for the time I've had   The only thing I need is some company from where have you been?.If I listen to your lies,   Would you say I'm a man without conviction,   I'm a man who doesn't know   How to sell a contradiction?.A modest man from mandrake   Travelled rich to the city   He had a need to discover   A use for his newly-found wealth      Because he was human   Because he had goodness   Because he was moral   They called him insane      Delusions of grandeur   Visions of splendour   A manic depressive   He walks in the rain      Eyes wide open   Heart undefended   Innocence untarnished      Cinderella man   Doing what you can   They can't understand   What it means      Cinderella man   Hang on to your plans   Try as they might   They cannot steal your dreams      In the betrayal of his love he awakened   To face a world of cold reality   And a look in the eyes of the hungry   Awakened him to what he could do      He held up his riches   To challenge the hungry   Purposeful motion   For one so insane      They tried to fight him   Just couldn't beat him   This manic depressive   Who walks in the rain.This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring."
"Cause the truth..The ceremony is sure to be cursed..I forgot to let   I forgot to let you know that   Justified Candy!.It's not that I'm so cheerful, though I'll always raise a smile   And if at times my nonsense rhymes then I'll stand trial   My friends are all around me but they only breathe through fear   Were I to cry, I'm sure that still they'd never see a tear      In darkness through my being here, away from you   The bright light of your star confronts me shining through      Dull and sullen, much subdued, my skull a stony glaze   Whirlpools rage on constantly, I'm not so well these days   There must be something somewhere near who sees what's being done   The harbor lights are burning bright, my wax is almost run      In darkness through my being here, away from you   The bright light of your star confronts me, shining through      Come Lollard, raise your lute and sing, and to my ears her beauty bring   Like Maddox in the days of old we'll feast and drink until we fold   And folding still we'll spare a thought for what's been lost and what's been caught   And maybe then begin again for love is life, not poison      In darkness through my being here, away from you   The bright light of your star confronts me, shining through.Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned   Turn away from light   It's not enough, just a touch   It's not enough      I taste, I love   I come, I bleed enough   I hate, I'm not   I was, I want too much      Is it any wonder I can't sleep?. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected."

The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."

The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   "

The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.

Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."

This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. "
"At night the boss came home   Inquiring about this lady..Picture me in the key of E,   Call me Uncle John   Any fool can easily see that we   Go back a long time   Feel something like fine to me,   There's no such thing as the wrong time   He hops up on my knee, singing,   Get down, Pops, it's song time..Speaks to god of broken dreams,   Never wondering why when nothing's heard, one prayer..And I wish I knew more of you..(Gold-Lloyd-Echolette)      This is a national anthem   From the flip-side of the empire   Hand on my heart   Heart on the sleeve of the constitution   Sinking right into a mirror   Leaving reflections on its surface   Caught in a kind of radio-beacon   That's sending out signals   Transmitting them backwards   Hey, tell me it's true   Is this the other side of you   Worlds gonna change   With a move in your face,   Do I still walk on the same structure?.In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  "
"Their love I must enter   Before thou can blame my soul   That is peace"".I've felt the ocean's roar..I've got a lover back in japan   He's got tatooes   He's my superman   I try to call him up from time to time   We can talk about the weather   Is the weather fine?.You said, I agree..That's right you, oh you, yeah you,   I said you gotta have some friends,   I'm talkin' about friends, that's right, friends..In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does"

In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:– “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.

"Yeah, sweet girl   I need you..Yes I would   If I could, I surely would..And I wish I kept them inside my mind..Camelback cinema..I'm walking a line   Visiting houses in motion   I'm walking a line   Just barely enough to be living   Get outta the way   No time to begin   This isn't the time   So nothing was done   Not talking about   Not many at all   I'm turning around   No trouble at all   Two different houses surround you, 'round you   I'm walking a line   Divide and dissolve..In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph."
"Snake bite, color my imagination   Like a spiral dream of illumination   It fills me up like a medication   I got the taste, do you mind, here I go again.Eat it!..he wuz me and I wuz him   Wish I had a plane to fly here's what I'd write in the sky   Gone' fishin'..(This is it.).So, we're fucking tonight..The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her."

She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test."
"Praise You till the morning sun shines upon my eyes   Praise You till the moon begins to shine   I lift You up above my heart   I'm Yours right from the start   I lift my simple songs for Your delight      Here I am to praise You   Here I am to worship You   Let me sing this song for You      Chorus:   You are my glorious   My glorious risen Lord   You are most wonderfull   Coz no one to compare   With You Lord....One of these mornings proud and fair   Get on my wings, I'm gonna fly the air..Gotta hold on easy as I let you go   Going to tell you how much I love you   Though you think you already know   I remember I thought you looked like an angel   Wrapped in pink, so soft and warm   You've had me wrapped around your finger   Since the day you were born      [Chorus:]   Beautiful baby, from the outside in   Chase your dreams but always know   The road that will lead you home again   Go on, take on this old world but to me   You know you'll always be my little girl      When you were in trouble that crooked little smile   Could melt my heart of stone   Now look at you   I turned around and you've almost grown   Sometimes when you're asleep   I whisper I love you in the moonlight at your door   As I walk away, I hear you say   Daddy love you more      [Chorus:]      Someday some boy will come and ask me for your hand   But I won't say yes to him   Unless I know he's the half that makes you whole   He has a poet's soul and the heart of a man's man   I know he'll say that he's in love   But between you and me, he won't be good enough      [Chorus:].Chorus   Reach out and touch your dreams..Hey!. In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment."

This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both @CAPS1 is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home oF Vietnam very much. However, both oF them must and will adOpt to their new environments.."
"Got our feet on a narrow road   Got our eyes on the one who will be our goal   and our brothers at our side   If we stumble we won't fall   If we miss the mark He'll be there after all   With an everlasting prize   The race is on      [Chorus]   Cone on and go   Leave behind the sin you find   That slows your time   Come on and go   You know the race is on   Come on and go   Straight ahead be safely led   By him instead   Come on and go   You know the race is on      Lord I try running my own race   Losin' ground, losin' hope   Losin' sight of your face   And I'm ready to retire      Then I'm back on your solid ground   You remind me of the strength   That in you I've found   And you fill me with your fire   The race is on      [Chorus].Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?.You wanna know if I know why   I can't say that I do   Don't understand the you or I   Or how one becomes two   I just can't recall what started it off   Or how to begin again   I ain't here to break ya   Just see how far it will bend   Again and again, again and again      I wanna make it   I wanna make it wit' chu   Anytime, anywhere   I wanna make it   (Again and again)   I wanna make it wit' chu      Sometimes the same is different   But mostly it's the same   These mysteries of life...

The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   "
"Come back, baby..Do you ever walk alone?.Close to you)   (Haa, close to you)   (Why?.Words and music by Pete Seeger   Performed by Pete Seeger and Tao Rodriguez-Seeger      Where have all the flowers gone?.Cause a womens life is love, a mans love is life..The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too."
"Let's hide the truth with the best lie   Let's decieve the reality with the greatest dream   Even though we're such a couple   I don't want to lose you   Say, why are you so uneasy?.Ain't no sunshine when she's   Gone, only darkness everyday..Do you feel alright?.Standing in line, when you come home,   Standing in line, what you're gonna do now?.Gather round me boys and fill your coffee cups   I'll tell you all a story while you drive them trucks   A story bout a girl who joined the state patrol   The legend of the Lady Bear is how it goes   She married some young trucker she was in her teens   And like all newly weds they had their hopes and dreams   And one night in a snowstorm so the story went   She lost her loving husband in an accident   They say she sat and cried for him a year or more   And all she did was think of him and walk the floor   She'd lie there in her bed at night alone and cold   Until one day she joined the highway state patrol      [Guitar ]      Well they say she has a CB and she's on the air   And she goes by the handle of the Lady Bear   She never gives a ticket and she works at night   All she does is tell the story of her life   I've heard some truckers say there ain't no Lady Bear   And others say she don't work when the weather's fair   But when the weather's bad she's on the air all night   Begging us to slow down till the weather's right   Well you know I love this story well it could be true   If you're ever in a snowstorm tell you what to do   If you should hear the Lady Bear on your radio   Well tell her I wrote this song and said hello.The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represent saeng’s determination and the situation she has now. She just come to the new country and she haven’t adjusted herself to this new country yet. She was disappointed like “mashaft of the war afternoon starlight.” “war” showed saeng was ery upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much “snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. “spring” symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. She would succeed in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion. It symbolizes hope."
"From di gyal dem look pon me!.What is that you say?.So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it   And I'll arrange the stars around (oh oh oh)   Tell me true, tell me nice, tell me how you feeling   The universe is ours tonight (oh oh oh)   Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment   This house of ours is made of fire (Oh oh oh)      And I'll arrange a spell of desire..You ready?.That's part of their job..I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she’ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she’s stating once everything “come back to life” then she’ll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared."

The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home.

Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home."

Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.

"January's always bitter   But Lord, this one beats all   The wind ain't quit for weeks now   And the drifts are ten feet tall   I been all night drivin' heifers   Closer in to lower ground   Then I spent the mornin' thinkin'   'Bout the ones the wolves pulled down   Charlie Barton and his family   Stopped today to say goodbye   He said the bank was takin' over   The last few years were just too dry   And I promised that I'd visit   When they found a place in town   Then I spent a long time thinkin'   'Bout the ones the wolves pull down   Lord, please shine a light of hope   On those of us who fall behind   And when we stumble in the snow   Could you help us up while there's still time   Well, I don't mean to be complainin'   LordYou've always seen me through   And I know you got your reasons   For each and every thing you do   But tonight outside my window   There's a lonesome, mournful sound   And I just can't keep from thinkin'   'Bout the ones the wolves pull down   Oh Lord, keep me from bein'   The one the wolves pull down.No matter how they may construe it   (it'll be the wrong way)   Whether or not, we have to rue it   (we will)   Whatever made us do it   Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?.Yes, I see their joy and sadness..Out on an open highway,   Such a lovely day but something's wrong..Save our lives...   Can't revive....The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine. She is finally settling into her new life and says that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future."
"Rest in peace   Here with me?.I don't know why, was getting so good with us,   I don't know why, was getting so good with us,   I don't know why, was getting so good,   Was getting so good with us..I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay..Coulda been the Willie Nelson,   Coulda been the wine      When I left your house this morning,   It was a little after nine   It was in Bobcaygeon, I saw the constellations   Reveal themselves, one star at time      Drove back to town this morning,   With working on my mind   I thought of maybe quittin',   Thought of leavin' it behind      Went back to bed this morning   And as I'm pullin' down the blind,   Yeah, the sky was dull and hypothetical   And fallin' one cloud at a time      That night in Toronto,   With its checkerboard floors   Riding on horseback,   And keeping order restored,   Til The Men They Couldn't Hang,   Stepped to the mic and sang,   And their voices rang with that Aryan twang      I got to your house this morning,   Just a little after nine   In the middle of that riot,   Couldn't get you off my mind      So, I'm at your house this morning,   Just a little after nine   'Cause, it was in Bobcaygeon   Where I saw the constellations reveal themselves   One star at time.I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term   African American Express   Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell   Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to   Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit   Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips      And I am   And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them   Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky   This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas   So get your ass up off the wall. The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions."
"Maybe it's the spring putting thoughts in our heads..Beyond the sunset, O blissful morning   When with our Saviour heaven's begun   Earth's toiling ended, O glorious dawning   Beyond the sunset when day is done..I'm not a hero..We're just two lost souls   Swimming in a fish bowl,   Year after year,   Running over the same old ground..I wanna understand      [Chorus:]   Maybe I will never be   Who I was before   Maybe I don't even know her anymore   Maybe who I am today   Ain't so far from yesterday   Can I find a way to be   Every part of me?.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about."
"No time for romantic escape,   When your fluffy heart is ready for rape..Whoa..Billy said this town is dying,   It's dying just to be like me..Motherfuck is you wit me?.[Verse 2]   I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to,   But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two..The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the “test” again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she “failed the test”, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow."
"Never, I know I'll never, oh ever grow tired of you   Oh never, I know I'll never, oh ever stop loving you   And you will never have to cry   'Cause I will never make you blue   And there will never be a cloud   To keep the sun from shining through   Oh never, I know I'll never, oh ever stop loving you   And if someone should ever try   To take me from your love and charms   They'd only be the one to cry   'Cause I would never leave your arms   Oh never, I know I'll never, oh ever stop loving you   Never....All Along   Deep inside secret's burning   I Should have known all the while what's true   I went along, to fool myself      Can't go on, I can't escape it   All along   I think I really knew   It was there in the words unspoken      All along   Still believed in you   Now I stand here betrayed and broken   Close my eyes from the burning      All along all the while it's true   Take it on, or turn your back   Either way, you can't escape it.Pour out salt to dry on the body, let it lie,   There for forty days until it mummifies..And time goes by so slowly and time can do so much, are you still mine?.But I know that I would rather die, then let this feeling go..In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver’s test. To Saeng her failing the driver’s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng’s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn’t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     "

However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     "
"It ain't too many niggaz that can do it like I can   When them records ain't sellin' and the stitches start tellin'   Motherfucker they yellin, get 'em Buck!!.She's just an American,   Riding a dream..Please don't go, not this time,   Oh no don't leave me tonight..Never kissed an angel   Let me kiss one tonight      If I said ""I love you""   Would I be speaking out of turn?.I can take a plane high up in the sky and fly for a million miles   Write a melody so sweet, make a tear turn into a smile   I can see the color of spring I can even feel the weather change   And soon the leaves fall and winter calls,   'Cause nothing ever stays the same   When I think of where I've been, what I've done and all I own   How I think I know everything, like I made it here on my own   And like the wind that blows, like a flower that grows   Still with all I can do      (Without You) life's a song with no end   Without You, like having a heart that won't mend   Without You, we're just actors on a stage   Like a child who's lost his way   Wouldn't be here today without You      I admit that sometimes pride tries to hide my view   And even this gift that you gave me, I forget it's for You   And all the many days and many ways Your grace I've abused   Still you were patient and Your love loved me through   But the wind still blows and the flower still grows and one thing is still true..The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages"
"It's just a place, it's just a place....Fish on      I was just a little pup   And it was derby day   Was dad and me and Darrell   Out in San Pablo bay   Taco flavored Doritos   And my orange life vest   Dad caught a hundred pound sturgeon   On twenty-pound test   Now he fought that fish for an hour   And a half   Darrell'd say Jump ya sons a bitch!.(Chorus x4)   Ahhh!!.And you said that would be oh so great..Over here it's hide and seek   Get on the midnight train..Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
"I know there's never been a man in the awful shape I'm in   I can't even spell my name, my head's in such a spin   Today I tried to eat a steak with a big old tablespoon   You got me chasin' Rabbits, walkin' on my hands and howlin' at the moon..A police car and a screaming siren   A pneumatic drill and ripped up concrete   A baby waiting and stray dog howling   The screech of brakes and lamp lights blinking      That's entertainment   A smash of glass and the rumble of boots   An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth   Paint splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat   Lights going out and a kick in the balls      That's entertainment   Days of speed and slow time Mondays   Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday   Watching the news and not eating your tea   A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls      That's entertainment   Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning   Opening the windows and breathing in petrol   An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard   Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays      That's entertainment   Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes   Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume   A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac   Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway      That's entertainment   Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight   Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude   Getting a cab and traveling on buses   Reading the graffiti about slashed seat affairs      That's entertainment.They think that I'm a rover,   But my roving days are over..I'll meet you half the way   Whoa yeah..Come to my garden,   Taste the fruits and the spices of love..The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
"All I wanna do   Is make woopie   Your my pink cookie..I only need one answer..Same ol' bedroom floor   Same ol' empty sheets   I hate this haunted bed   So down here's where I sleep      Tryin' to find a place   To hide what you have left   Some things never change   My heart hasn't yet      Well I don't wanna go out tonight   Yeah but I can't be alone   Standing underneath this broke streetlight   Can't somebody take me home   Can't somebody take me home      The hope that we had left   Wrapped around your ring   That river just rolled on by   When I watched it sink      Well I don't wanna go out tonight   Yeah but I can't be alone   Standing underneath this broke streetlight   Can't somebody take me home   Can't somebody take me...      Out of this bar   Out of this heartache   Out of this town   That just keeps breakin' down   Keeps breakin' down...

A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on."

The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle."
"There's a new day dawnin', that belongs to you and me..I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty,   And with every touch you fixed them..Head on my shoulder   Tears on my shirtsleeve   What did I say wrong   Hurt by a gesture   Not by reaction   Is love saying so long   Inside my heart   Young young young wise people   Young young young loud sound   Onto the dance floor   Out of the sadness   Tears without tempo   Swim in their beauty   Swim in their upset   The bell will ring   For me and my girl   Up to the altar time standing still   When he says will you you say you will      It's the proposal   She thought she'd never   Hear on a dance floor   Joy finds its features   Upon her lipstick   Kissed with an answer   Inside my heart-   All up to day break   All up to dropsake   I hear a slow song   Close gets the love ones   Onto the dance floor   The bells are ringing   For me and my girl   Nothing can alter nothing can change   I'll go to pieces, pieces of eight.Tell me where   Where is it written   What is it I was meant to be?.Come on, come on, come on      Baby baby baby   Won't you be my girl?.It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader."
"I still love you when you're not around..Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou..I swear this time it's not a game..But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets   Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights   We count on the night to hold everything even,   And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,   And destinies folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone..Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run   I swear I didn't do what they say I done   I swear I didn't do what they say I done      Ghetto destroyer paranoia, I need a lawyer   This bitch named Netoia, say they lookin' for ya   Got to get the fuck out of here (yeah right)   This bitch dimmed the lights (nigga, spend the night)   Bust a quick nut, got to fuck up and gat on   'cause this the same street I got shot on   So God bless Don Polla, double-s   I gotta holla 'cause I'm smokin' on double breath   Freakin', niggas be leakin', information   Got the feds seekin', incarceration   Niggas say my name popped up   Bitch hop up   Nigga close the shop up   They try to stop em   My cash flow leave me asshole neck it   Gone in sixty seconds, burn all records   Nigga gettin' skinny eating dinnies   Count my pennies, only got a bag fulla twenties      [Chorus]   Listen, these feds fishin' for this extradition   I'm on a mission, fuck em, fight em, dine em, ditch em   I gotta kick rocks, can't pick locks   Or spend the rest of my life in a shit-?bath      It's so hard to get a room without a credit card   It's so hard not to let em know where you are   Tried to get a rent a car   But he laughed when I showed him cash   Had to mash 'fore he called the feds on my ass   Went to Vegas for the weekend   Met a hoe down freakin'   Hey bitch, why you sneakin'?.In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal."
"Only few supporters stay..Lived my life and walked it alone   All my time and my heart was my own, for so long   I held the key to everything I'd need   Every dream, so sure that I'd succeed   'Cause I was strong, so strong   I swear that it was true, till the day that I found you   Come to me, breakin' me, showin' me no mercy   What have ya done to me, baby      [Chorus]   Look where you are, here in my arms   Filling my heart with your love   But I can't get close enough to you   I've got no control   You shake my soul when we touch   Still I can't get close enough to you      Time goes by and it grows stronger still   With a smile I surrender my will, I'm on my knees   Passion's taken me so far across the line   All power of reason is no longer mine   I'm just waitin' to please   What else can I do, I'm forever wantin' you   Time goes by and it grows stronger still   With a smile I surrender my will, I'm on my knees   Come to me, breakin' me, showin' me no mercy   What have you done to me      [Chorus]      Baby, you're the last thing that I had planned   Got me livin' in the palm of your hand   The more I have of you the less I understand   How ya give me so much   And I just never get enough   Can't get close enough, baby      Look where you are, here in my arms   Filling my heart with your love   But I can't get close enough to you   God only knows   You shake my soul when we touch   Still I can't get close enough to you      Come to me, breakin' me, showin' me no mercy   Filling my heart with your love   Still I can't get close enough to you   God only knows   You shake my soul when we touch   Can't get close enough to you   Can't get close enough to you, baby   Here in my arms.Here I am again   I've come to see you smile   I know you understand   I have to say again   It's only for awhile      And still you're always here   Just waiting for my call   I wish I knew a Way   To give more than I do   I want to give it all      CHORUS   It doesn't happen every day   But it happened to me once before   Those early years I threw away   Now I only have to hear your voice   To make me feel so sure   That your love is why   I want to give it all      Don't the minutes fly   And hours just seem so few   With days apart so long   It's hard to spend my time   When I'm so far from you      And still you're always there   Just waiting for my call   I wish I knew a way   To give more than I do   I want to give it all.The hood ain't been the same since the Old G's died..Pain      Twirling leech, spinning down below   Wishing for the song to write   Leer at me, I can't see   Am I wrong to be?.There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time."
"Flying through the night in a beat up wagon   A mike stand up my jacksy   Give me a beer and I'll stand on a chair   And slip into something sexy   Black Cat Woolwich, The Tiger's Head   The Cafe des Artistes, The Revolution and the Bag O' Nails      I'll see you down the Speak'   Your Ma said you slept real good in your food last night   But you couldn't hold it down   And you broke up a damn good fight   Ligging at the Old Marquee, spinning Jack a line   Even he knew better than me, back in sixty nine      Sixty nine, sixty nine   Sixty nine, sixty nine      On the road to Paradiso   Back of your head, got to pay some dues   Rugged looked down as the Thames swallowed   His life at the Boathouse, Kew   Hot girls, no AC, cheap TV, sleep on the floor   Hallelujah what's a roadie, hush my baby sleep no more.CHORUS: x4   Sunshine on a rainy day   Makes my soul, makes my soul   Trip Trip Trip Away   You touch me with your spirit   You touch me with your heart   You touch me in the darkness,   A feeling starts   Make you feel make you feel so unreal (so unreal)   Like a wind in the desert   Like a moon on the street   CHORUS x4   Instrumental   Sunshine on a rainy day makes my soul makes my soul trip trip trip away x4.When we grew up you traded your promise   For my ring..I'll see you round about midnight   You know I won't be late   Let's dive into this crap house   And truth hell have to wait      The truth of what has gone before   Lies bleeding on the floor   The only truth remaining still   Is that truth don't matter anymore      So meet me round about midnight   I won't let you down I swear   We'll hang on to each other   Down at the new Times Square      It seems that we can't run from this   No matter how we try   There's nothing here worth keeping   So let's kiss it all goodbye      Tell me what's worth keeping anyway   It doesn't seem to matter   What we do or what we say   Everything we had   They have now taken it all away   The truth don't matter anymore.Here we go   Fast and slow   On the big chair      But we don't know   Where we're going   On the big chair.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test."

The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story."
"From until we're no longer one   'Til that's no longer permanent..(no-one)      [Chorus:]   And I find (for a good time)   I'm knocking for a good time (for a good time)   Now I find (for a good time)   I'm knocking for a good time (for a good time)      Standing on the outside   I'm looking in   Trying to be heard   I don't know where to begin   Help me baby show me how   To be a part of it all and all   Right here, and now      [Chorus]      Hands are full of silver   My pockets full of gold   It's time I'm trying to spend   And I can't get myself sold   I'm a bargain honey   I'm a giveaway   And you can have it all   If you'd use up my day..Crushin?.Down the hatch and a bad attitude..(I'm not afraid)   You'll never change   What's been and gone      'Cause all of the stars   Are fading away   Just try not to worry   You'll see them some day   Take what you need   And be on your way   And stop crying your heart out      'Cause all of the stars   Are fading away   Just try not to worry   You'll see them some day   Take what you need   And be on your way   And stop crying your heart out      We're all of us stars   We're fading away   Just try not to worry   You'll see us some day   Just take what you need   And be on your way   And stop crying your heart out   Stop crying your heart out   Stop crying your heart out   Stop crying your heart out.The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. "
"(Hey!).Come on everybody, give it a try   Raise your voices to the sky   Magic will happen here somehow   If we're all together now, oh   All together now      La-la-la, la-la-la,   La-la-la-la-la-la!.Don't count the waves,   Don't count the waves..I've been sleeping with the lights on   Cause the darkness is surrounding you.This is why I want to kill the punk,   'cause he tried to take a motherfucking chunk of the funk..The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today."
"I didn't come in here to fight   I didn't come to ruin your night   I came to see the future mister me   I didn't come to mess things up   I only want to wish you luck   And shake the hand of the future mister me      I only want a chance   To see the man who'll be the man to please my baby   The one who'll lay beside you   And hold you just the way I used to do   I want to know you're happy   And I want to know he treats you like a lady   And if I can see you're in good hands   Maybe I can make it without you      You look so happy by his side   And I'm sure you'll make a lovely bride   And he loves you, any fool can plainly see   The pain is just too much for me   So I'll just leave and let you be   All alone with the future mister me      You'll be alone here with the future mister me.Well   Dionne   You should have held my hand   You should have let me be your man   Dionne   You should have closed your eyes   You should have held on with both hands to your prize   Dionne   You should have let me down easy   If you had no plans to please me   Dionne      Dionne   I could have been the one   I could have shown you the shelter reserved under the sun   Dionne, Dionne   I could have whispered you're name   I could have whispered you're name if only for fun   Dionne   You should have let me down easy   If you had no plans to please me   Dionne, Dionne   Dionne      Dionne      Dionne, Dionne   We could have shared a martini   We could have danced to Mancini, till dawn   Dionne   I should have broke down and kissed you   I should have I just miss you   Dionne.All of a sudden I am finding religion..The rain that's fallin' on my window pane..I know he wasn't   I immediately gave him all my money..The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did."

She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again."
"Turn to me - when your heart breaks away   Turn to me - don't turn me away   When everything's sad and down   When you're looking for somewhere to run      Why don't you turn to me?.You can feel it now or be stoned   Yes, you feel it come, right now!.(Esham)   The red of blood I seen it come in 25 shades   Just your ordinary average homicide days   Long ago a homie told me, yo that crime pays   No I'm in the hot pursuit, I'm riding sideways   I know my life ain't worth the bullets in your '45   But you ain't hitting me, I jump into a sporty dive   Before you know I got my shank inside your throat and sides   24's on 84 Regal as you was flooring right   Pilling, chrome creeping, through the ghetto zone   9 milli-milli bang for the metal tome   Send you back to your mama wrapped in cello-phone   You seen the lights of the flashy berretta chrome   Slice your ass with this hatchet like we Tom and Jerry   Knock your shit out, get you paid by the tooth fairy   When you die you're getting wet up like your bloody Carrie   Tuck your ass nice and cozy for the cemetery   When I burry your ass   (Chorus)   Money to my mamma, I'm sending that   Corners full of drama I'm bending that   24's on a 84 Regal, and I'm grinding   24's on a 84 Regal, and I'm grinding   Money to my mamma, I'm sending that   Corners full of drama, I'm bending that   24's on a 84 Regal and I'm grinding   24's on my 84 Regal and I'm grinding   (TNT)   24's on my 84 Regal   I'm riding down your block with 2 Desert Eagles   I'm fixing to save the underground like Neo..I ain't got nothing..And the worms ate into his brain..She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring."

That is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home."
"And I'm shameless..Look up and see the clouds, look down and see the cold floor..I'm afraid to face tomorrow..Oh god once again, we come into your presence with expectancy in our hearts   God we know your gonna bless us   So we lift our hands in the sanctuary   And we give you glory and honor and praise   Come on, come on      We lift our hands in the sanctuary   We lift our hands to give you the glory   We lift our hands to give you the praise   And we will praise you for the rest of our days   Yes, we will praise you for the rest of our day's 2x      Come on lift your hands in his presence   And if you love him open up your mouth and glorify him   Lets take it a little higher      We clap our hands in the sanctuary   We clap our hands to give you the glory   We clap our hands to give you the praise   And we will praise you for the rest of our days   Yes, we will praise for the rest of our days      Come on clap your hands all you people   And shout to God with the blessed of triumph      We sing a song in the sanctuary   We sing a song to give you the glory   We sing a song to give you the praise   And we will praise you for the rest of our days   Yes, we will praise you for the rest of our days      Jesus we give your the praise   Emmanuel we lift up your name   Heavenly Father coming Messiah   And we will praise you for the rest of our days   Yes, we will praise you for the rest of our days      Allelujah in the sanctuary   Allelujah we give you the glory   Allelujah we give you the praise   And we will praise you for the rest of our days   Yes, we will praise you for the rest of our days      Jesus we give your the praise   Emmanuel we lift up your name   Heavenly Father coming Messiah   And we will praise you for the rest of our days   Yes, we will praise you for the rest of our days      5x   Yes, yes Lord for the rest of our days 6x      Allelujah 6X   For the rest of our days.!.The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”, says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself “Then i will take the test again.”     "
"Bring it home to me, baby..I love you, yes I do, babe, and I love you, I do, sweet lips..I feel you, each move you make..Deep in the heart of Texas   And 'round the Frisco Bay   All over St. Louis   Way down in New Orleans   All the cats want to dance with   Sweet little sixteen      'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand   Philadelphia P.A..Let's go, Steve walks warily down the street,   With the brim pulled way down low   Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,   Machine guns ready to go      Are you ready,   Are you ready for this   Are you hanging on the edge of your seat   Out of the doorway the bullets rip   To the sound of the beat      [Chorus]   Another one bites the dust   Another one bites the dust   And another one gone, and another one gone   Another one bites the dust   Hey, I'm gonna get you too   Another one bites the dust      How do you think I'm going to get along,   Without you, when you're gone   You took me for everything that I had,   And kicked me out on my own      Are you happy, are you satisfied   How long can you stand the heat   Out of the doorway the bullets rip   To the sound of the beat      [Chorus]      Another one bites the dust   Another one bites the dust   Another one bites the dust   Another one bites the dust   There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man   And bring him to the ground   You can beat him   You can cheat him   You can treat him bad and leave him   When he's down   But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you   I'm standing on my own two feet   Out of the doorway the bullets rip   Repeating the sound of the beat      [Chorus]. The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn’t  home she said “ I failed the test .” This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn’t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal."
"As ready as anybody can be..There's no signs of life in here at all..Amazona's   Getting closer   Soon you'll see..I love you, do you really love me?.I just need someone to laugh with..By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return From their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready."
"Lord, You've touched my heart today   That is why I've come to pray   You see all I have inside   All the things I try to hide   Jesus, I believe that You are there   And You're listening to this sinner's prayer   Touch this broken heart and make it new   I believe in You   Please forgive me for my sin   All I've done and all I've been   Serving You forevermore   Everyday You'll be my Lord   Jesus, I believe that You are there   And You're listening to this sinner's prayer   Knowing You'll remember what You've heard   I believe Your word   In Your name this prayer will end   And a new life will begin   Now I know, I'm not alone   Hold my hand and lead me home.How many friends have I really got?.(I'll be there)      I'll be there to comfort you,   Build my world of dreams around you,   I'm so glad that I found you..Without you standing by my side   Love and good fortune passes me by   And you were my guiding light   It seemed so easy   When we said goodbye      How different would the world be now   If only we had worked it out somehow   What kind of fools are you and I   There would be stars up in the sky   If you were with me now      And I know I may go astray   But who's to say that we can't change our mind   My love burns stronger each day   If I'm sure of one thing      One love at a time   How could we throw our love away   When we had so much more than words can say   The darkest clouds would fade away   To bring the light into my day   If you were with me now      If loving you is right   Then turn back the hands of time   I'd do anything to make you mine   There'snothing that I wouldn't do   I could make you feel my love for you   If you were with me now   If you were with me now   If you were with me now.I can sit here all night and tell these jokers some jokes,   But who wants to laugh, who's gonna laugh   At a broken heart?.The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that."
"Love is all you need..Te, qui couchent le soir m?.Dig it?.Hey!.Sometimes I get used to it and I forget that it's around..The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng “comfort in her time of discomfort.” She would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of that she fail test the first time because she was comfortable with being in a new place. But when spring comes, she’ll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding."
"(wosh)   Young mulla baby!.[Valjean and Cosette leave the inn.].Somebody must believe if they could see what I see   If they haven't, well they will   Baby they all will      Just when you suspect that life couldn't get harder, something comes   Along and makes your dark day darker   The weight of it all falls on you   Who will be the one to listen when it's time to listen?.[Chorus]      I witness a time and a place that never dies, still   Frozen in time,   This darkness the only place that I can hide, i   Witness a dream..When the hook sets in   And when this all ends..The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring."

He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants."
"Oh, well, I think you've got the knack..Always screwing with my mind, a thorn in my spine   Oh Sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time   In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine   Wait!.!.Don't ignore it   Gonna be alright      Revolution rock, I am in a state of shock   So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock      Careful how you slide, Clyde, all you did was glide   And you poured your beer in me hat   With my good eye on the beat, living on fixation street   And I ain't got no time for that.It's three-thirty, I fuckin' got here at nine   I'm finally up to the front, can't wait another minute   Why am I here?.The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng."
"Alright!.I take a breath!.When everybody knows, it's clear that you're upset with me..Who cares about little boys   That talk too much?.Everyone's crying for Harry Braff..The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng."

They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."
"Said the carpenter to the dainty bride,   I would never do a thing to jeopardize this union I consider prize,   Grass never will be greener on the other side..let go of my leg!.They ran away when they heard my cry      Valjean   Cosette, my child, what will become of you?.Just let me be!"".Lullay, thou little tiny child, by, by, lully, lullay..In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again. “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  "
"The staff says, ""He's not well!"".And now he's just a dream   That she used to love   Cause deep inside her heart   She's hold the memory of   The days she used to watch him   As the crowd sheered his name   To the day he lost the battle   And they carried him away..And oh oh oh can we find a reason ?.Girl, before you go now   There's one thing I wanted to do   That's get you to come back   Because I want to make love to you      Got me real turned on   Yes, you have      But there's something in your eyes   Telling me you have to go   Something in your eyes   But you're trying not to let it show      Got me real turned on      Next time you come over   I'll buy you a bottle of wine   Just take a little drink   And everything will turn out fine   Yes, it will      Whoa baby, do you know   What I've got in mind   Can you guess what it is   Or do you want it on the line      Got me real turned   Got me real turned   Got me real turned   Got me real turned on.Mr. Mastodon Farm,      Mr. Mastodon Farm,      Cuts swatches out of all material..I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1)."

It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test."

It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it."

The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time."

She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it."

The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change. The snow is melting represents change from cold to warm.

Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home. The flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight to Saeng's character. We now know that eventhough it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and love, she will have the strength to make it in a new world.?"

The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things."

Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the habiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng knew seeing the flower again will make her cry, will make her memories come back, she will be re tested."

She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better. As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass."
"Sha la la la la, sha la la la la   You used to call me your angel   Said I was sent straight down from heaven   And you'd hold me close in your arms   I thought of the way you felt so strong      I never wanted you to leave   I wanted you to stay here holdin' me      I miss you, I miss your smile   And I still shed a tear every once in a while   And even though it's different now   You're still here somehow      My heart won't let you go   And I need you to know   I miss you, sha la la la la   I miss you      You used to call me your dreamer   And now I'm livin' out my dream   Oh, how I wish you could see   Everything that's happenin' for me      I'm thinkin' back on the past   It's true the time is flyin' by too fast      I miss you, I miss your smile   And I still shed a tear every once in a while   And even though it's different now   You're still here somehow      My heart won't let you go   And I need you to know   I miss you, sha la la la la   I miss you      I know you're in a better place yeah   But I wish that I could see your face, oh   I know you're where you need to be   Even though it's not here with me      I miss you, I miss your smile   And I still shed a tear every once in a while   And even though it's different now   You're still here somehow      My heart won't let you go   And I need you to know   I miss you, sha la la la la      I miss you, I miss your smile   And I still shed a tear every once in a while   And even though it's different now   You're still here somehow      My heart won't let you go   And I need you to know   I miss you, sha la la la la   I miss you.The one that made all lips go blue..Will I catch you later?.Oh a moment still worth was a glow, all the bells rang out   There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted   ""let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace""..Put on the red shoes that you've never worn before..The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng She is a teenager her family just moved to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng failed her driving test and on the walk home discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus she falls in love with the Hibiscus. Saeng's mother has a garden she is always planting things a using plarts a veggies from her garden for dinner. The author conclude a paragraph that says where the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring Saeng with take the test again. I think Saeng says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants When she passes the test and she thinks seeing th Hibiscus will help her passthe driving test."
"Seems I've misplaced my desires   Seems I'm sweeping up the ashes   Of all my former fires   So brother, be a brother   And fill this tiny cup of mine   And please, sir, make it whiskey   For I have no head for wine      O brother, my cup is empty   And I haven't got a penny   For to buy no more whiskey   I have to go home      I counted up my blessings   And counted only one   One tiny little blessing   And now that blessings gone   So buy me one more drink, my brother   Then I'm taking to the road   Yes, I'm taking to the rain   I'm taking to the snow   O my friend, my only brother   Do not let the party grieve   So throw a dollar onto the bar   Now kiss my ass and leave      O brother, my cup is empty   And I haven't got a penny   For to buy no more whiskey   I have to go home.He's got one wife who wears a veil, it covers half her face,   From her nose right to her toes you'll see nothing else but space..It reaches wide across forever   It's dangerous and deep   And while some venture to the shoreline   Some even dare to leap   Chorus:   And The River rages, The River runs   All through the ages, Long after I'm gone   There's a truth I'm finding I can't ignore   Whether I dive in or stand on the shore   The River keeps rushing on..So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      I know You love   And I know You died for me   And I know You care   And I know You care      And I know You live again   Your life for all my sin   And now I stand here in   In Your grace again      When I look into the sky above   Wonder how my life has changed   Wonder how Your love, it came to me      When I look into the sky above   And all my fears, so far away   And all I feel is Heaven calling me      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      I know You love   And I know You died for me   And I know You care   And I know You care      And I know You live again   Your life for all my sin   And now I stand here in   In Your grace again      When I look into the sky above   Wonder how my life has changed   Wonder how Your love, it came to me      When I look into the sky above   And all my fears, so far away   And all I feel is Heaven calling me      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      When I look into the sky above   Wonder how my life has changed   Wonder how Your love, it came to me      When I look into the sky above   And all my fears, so far away   And all I feel is Heaven calling me      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do      So I look to You   So I look to You   No one else will do   No one else will do.Say no more, oh no more,   Well no more, oh, darling, oh!. I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home."
"Take advantage of what I still guess you do..These bloodless brides of Jesus   If they had just once glimpsed their groom   Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones   Concealed behind their rosaries   They wilt the grass they walk upon   They leech the light out of a room   They'd like to drive us down the drain   At the Magdalene laundries      Peg O'Connell died today   She was a cheeky girl   A flirt   They just stuffed her in a hole!.Grab some holly and mistletoe   'Cause we're gonna go out tonight..And I got to got to know      But what I really want to know is   Are you gonna go my way?.The only one who seen the change from the fame is you      [Chorus]      I'm the same nigga man   Same nigga, that ridin' with you   Niggas that's fuckin' with you   I'm still fuckin' with you niggas   The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like   Now they on my dick right?.The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes."
"Just pick it up..It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor   If you're old or young   Everybody, every now and then   Has got to have some fun      So turn up the music   Turn up the juice   Put me in the spotlight   And turn me loose      You better hold on tight   This country's gonna rock tonight      [Chorus]   This country's rockin'   To the beat of a brand new drum   Back in Kentucky where I come from   They love to hear that old guitar strum   This country's rockin'   Jump back and let the bad boys play   Everywhere across the USA   This country's rockin' all the way      You might ride a horse, drive a Porsche   Or cruise in limousines   Eat caviar with champagne   Or cornbread with your pinto beans      But there's one thing   In which we all agree   We love our country music   Like the Queen loves tea      What a lovely sight   We're gonna rock tonight      [Chorus].I heard you on my wireless back in '52   Lying awake intent on tuning in on you   If I was young it didn't stop you coming through   Oh-a-oh   They took the credit for your second symphony   Rewritten by machine on new technology   And now I understand the supernova scene   Oh-a-oh   I met your children   Oh-a-oh   What did you tell them?.You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth   More than mountains of silver and gold..Was in the merry month of May   When all gay flowers were a bloomin',   Sweet William on his death-bed lay   For the love of Barbara Allen..The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that “never giving up is important” is presented and carried out hopefully through the character’s vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard."
"(I will see it no more.).[Chorus - Both Sing]      [Alan]   But he don't care, I don't care..I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style..The crowd was getting old   The disco's back or so I'm told   But we've got nothing here   Except a tired set of ears and we say      Hey mama, I'm something   Check it out, see what it's all about   Cos this is soap disco, so charming   See the floor from a cleaner point of view      The children had the time   To overthrow the slime   The superchildren said they could see      Bright lights and clean colors   Check it out, see what it's all about   Cos this is soap disco, so charming   See the floor from a cleaner point of view      Bright lights and clean colors   Check it out, see what it's all about   Cos this is soap disco, so charming   See the floor from a cleaner point of view      Hey mama, I'm something   Check it out, see what it's all about   Cos this is soap disco, so charming   See the floor from a cleaner point of view.Don't give me love, don't give me faith.. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn’t like the change and would like to go back to her old home"
"You keep catching my eye   And we keep looking at each other   Is this what it feels like   To be someone's lover   There was never a time   And the clock didn't matter 'til now   And we could say that it's going well   It feels like Hell   Cause we walk and we talk   And we're just like the others   We touch and we move   Buried treasure discovered   And we've got no excuses at all   Cause we're just like lovers   This feels like I'm drowning   In some desert of misery   My heart lights up when I look at you   You're the only thing I can see   And we could say that it's going well   And when I'm away it feels like Hell   Cause we walk and we talk   And we're just like the others   We kiss hug and move   All our secrets get uncovered   And we've got no excuses at all   Cause we're just like   Some of the people never get to know   What we're going through   And if we're just good friends   I want to know   Why it feels like it's so much more   Are we just like lovers   I wanta know   I wanta know   Oh   We're just like lovers   We're just like lovers   We're just like lovers   We're just like lovers   Windows break   My life shatters   Nothing seems to matter   We are just like lovers   We got more than we've ever   Dreamt we could discover   Cause we're just like one another   We are just like lovers   We are   (Some other place some other time)   (Some other place some other time)   (Some other place some other time)   Cause we're just like one another   (Some other place some other time)   (Some other place some other time)   (Some other place some other time)   (Some other place some other time).Love came and hit me   Straight on the lips   The longer we're kissin'   The better it gets, and baby that's all right   You got me standing beside myself   You know it ain't like me   It's like I'm somebody else   But baby that's all right      You're not the man I was lookin' for   You're every bit of him plus a whole lot more   Now that I got you, it feels so good   I don't wanna let you go      I plead guilty babe, of this terrible crime   You been lovin' me all of this time   I must've been blind   What's gonna happen?.I was soaked in gasoline,   Playin' with a match..Add it up!.Is that all we've got?.The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces."
"How bad do you want it?.Oh the light from your smile   Can be seen for a mile   By travellers dark in their sorrow   If you want me to stay   Throw a smile my way   And I'll stay by your side 'till tomorrow      Woooah...      'cause all my battered dreams are shattered now   And I need all your beauty to warm me      In the time that I've known you   I've always shown you   That I could be captured in kindness   Now a storm's blowin'   Tomorrow I'm goin'   Well the sun takes away my blindness      Woooah....Dirt and sweat, runnin' down my back,   Workin' on the railroad..Red is a mother!.I was born to raise hell....The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not disappointed about failing is anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year.  "
"Don't get so busy that you miss   Giving just a little kiss   To the ones you love   Don't even wait a little while   To give them a little smile   A little is enough      How many people are crying   People are dying   How many people are asking for love      Don't save it all for Christmas Day   Find a way   To give a little love everyday   Don't save it all for Christmas Day   Find your way   Cause holidays have come and gone   But love lives on   If you give on   Love      How could you wait another minute   A hug is warmer when you're in it   And Baby that's a fact   And saying ""I love you's"" always better   Seasons, reasons, they don't matter   So don't hold back      How many people in this world   So needful in this world   How many people are praying for love      Don't save it all for Christmas Day   Find a way   To give a little love everyday   Don't save it all for Christmas Day   Find your way   Cause holidays have come and gone   But love lives on   If you give on   Love      Let all the children know   Everywhere that they go   Their whole life long   Let them know love      Don't save it all for Christmas Day   Find a way   To give a little love everyday   Don't save it all for Christmas Day   Find your way   Cause holidays have come and gone   But love lives on   If you give on   Love   Love.I wish it was over, Lord, please stop the rain..I can bring you back anytime I want to   I remember an angel in your veil of white so fine   You were always very near, well, I think that you're still here   It's so reads in the diary of my mind..Perhaps it's accidental   That love should come to me..Bubbles!.In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again."

She concludes the story by writing “when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough. That’s what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus."
"You are distraction   Like pictures on the wall   I don't like eyes      You are attraction   It gets to be routine   You're up, I'm down      She's got claws   But the factory knows   We're dreams in cold storage   We could dance the night away      You say you love me   Maybe you do   A patience I can't steal   I don't believe you   You said 'Straight'   It's like giving up hope      Here on the ground   On the floor   Screaming nothing at all   Here on the ground   Like some whore   Looking down on you all   Too much advice   I'm not sure      Laughing hyenas   With pens for charm   You'll just suck in the boys   We have to leave soon   Shudder..In fear every day, every evening,   He calls her aloud from above,   Carefully watched for a reason,   Painstaking devotion and love,   Surrendered to self preservation,   From others who care for themselves..What is this?.If words that were spoken, had not shattered me   If I was unbroken, I'd never know   The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go   To be unbroken, to be unbroken   To be unbroken, to be unbroken   To be unbroken, to be unbroken   To be unbroken, to be unbroken   To be unbroken, to be unbroken   To be unbroken, to be unbroken.So strange, victory, 1200 spires   The only sound, moscow burning..In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng saying “when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending. The rest of the story is and sad because saeng misses her home in Vietnam. ""Its – it’s not a real one. I mean, it’s not like the kind we had at – at – she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before."" The end sends the message that even though things are different than before, she won’t give up trying to make a good life in the United States and not let this change affect her "

In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again."

The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant."
"Maybe life didn't want this part of me..Easy come girl, easy go....Why can't I be crazy?.But that was ""sometime ago."".In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She says that she will try again. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up."

She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes “saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain."

This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace."
"Makes you want to cry..I could get carried away but not anymore...   What was it I heard you say you love me 'cause I'm strong   I hope that you're not wrong..Boy, I do..down by the riverside (Oh)   Down by the riverside, down by the riverside   I'm gonna put on my long white robe, (Where?).This is such a pity..The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences. SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did."
"Did you know I was waiting for you   To love you the rest of my life?.And so it must be for so it is written   On the doorway to paradise   That those who falter and those who fall   Must pay the price!.Oh how praying rests the weary   Prayer will change the night to day   So when life seems dark and dreary   Don't forget to pray..I may have been gazing out too late at night   I see a deeper window into my eyes   Every day they screech outside my window,   The crashing cars never seem to collide      Sometimes when I'm staring out my window   To catch the stars, I watch as they go by   I've been getting messages from outer space   They expire light in the window in the sky   There goes my mind      If we dare walk onto my window   I could hear them if I open my eyes      Sometimes flashing lights seem soulful in the window   You may have seen them circle me at night   I keep sending signals into outer space   They expire by your window in the sky   There goes my mind      Every day when restlessness takes over me   I can't see it as I'm closing my eyes   I keep sending signals into outer space   They expire light in the window in the sky      Sometimes when I'm staring out my window   To catch the stars, I watch as they go by   I've been getting messages from outer space   They expire light in the window in the sky      By your window in the sky.Make tomorrow, make tomorrow, make tomorrow today..The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”"
"The child I never knew..That you may know the warmth of love,   And wrap it all around you   It's just a wish, a dream I'm told   From days when I was young      Merry Christmas, little Zachary   Merry Christmas, everyone   Merry Christmas, little Zachary   Merry Christmas, everyone.But don't forget it takes both two to make love that's good and true   And then you'll find she loves you too and there's nothing left to do   Buy diamond rings and make some plans to go and see the preacher man   Well, it's so easy to fall in love....Tomorrow never comes      Time, is going by, so much faster than I,   And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you..If you could read my mind love,   What a tale my thoughts could tell..I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn’t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, “but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.” thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  "
"Tell me a story..(I turn to you)   For the strength (for the strength)   To be strong for the will to carry on..It's alright to give it one more try..Yes and I used to love her, but it's all over now.And the wind and the spring couldn't do anything..The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it."
"Hey!.Ly ly ly, ly ly ly, ly ly ly..Chorus   With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,   Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,   But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,   And there's no salvation to be found..He heard the sound of a thousand years   Calling out   Calling out      In the house of Salome   You have to surrender.That way that girl is, baby,   She must have had a piece of it, too..The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test. I thiNk the author was compariNg the hibiscus to their life aNd obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still staNdiNg theN that meaNs everythiNg will be fiNe to where she caN go back aNd take the test."
"Don't leave me tonight, don't leave me tonight,   Don't leave me tonight, oh no no..Go!.Farther along we'll know all about it   Farther along we'll understand why   Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine   We'll understand it all by and by..Hey, see you soon   Sail through your room   I'll meet you there      Hey, be my friend   Stay 'til the end   Don't walk away   Hey, hey, hey-hey      Hey, take them off   Don't talk that way   Don't hear my lover say   Hey, hey, hey      Chains, move that thing   Chains, we don't see   My chain's way too long   Chains      Chains, move that thing   Chains, we don't see   Chains are way too long   And hear my song   Hear my song.Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand   Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand   And together we'll walk into Canaan land   Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand      Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand   Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand   And together we'll walk into Canaan land   Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand      (Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)   (Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)   And together we'll walk into Canaan land   (Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)      (Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)   (Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)   And together we'll walk into Canaan land   (Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand).There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says “a blossom of two would have blown into the well” It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said”she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.” This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing."
"There's nothing like crazy love, it comes and it goes,   Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew   At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love..'Cause I'm yours      Why can't we be like that?.So many words have passed through my mind   Never thought I'd be so blind   Wish I could understand you   So many things I've heard and seen   But still don't know what you mean      When you say ""I'm leaving you""   I wish I could remember   Everything I've learnt   I've tried and tried to be so good   And I know I should   Say something before you go   Cause every time I've done something wrong   It's so hard to be strong      Gone are the feelings I want to show   (Oh) Words of wisdom, (Oh) teach me more   (Oh) Words of wisdom, (Oh) so much more.I want you..Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson, lira, gustafsson   Everybody need something to believe in   Everybody need something to put their trust in x2   Some with luck, put their faith in love   Some show off and let the money talk   Some look up, read the stars above   Some believe in making dead man walk   Another year and another week, another day   Time keeps running and everything will be okay x2   Chorus:   Everybody need something to believe in   Everybody need something to put their trust in x2   Free...believe in what you want   Free...believe in what you want   Some might say it's a miracle   Some might call it the destiny   Some let god, lead them all the way   Some would say they believe in me   Another year and another week, another day   Time keeps running and everything will be okay x2   Chorus.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     "

The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject."
"The wind cried a lamentation,   before merging with the grey..Gonna have a good time tonight..I Will Praise The Lord   Words and Music by Ray Boltz   Bleeding in the darkness   The cell was cold and black   Driven to unconsciousness   By the stripes upon His back   He heard a voice call out his name   His mind began to clear   And in the darkness he replied,   Silas, I am here   You know my brother Silas,   Paul uttered with a groan,   Today I thought for sure   We were going home   And when I opened up my eyes   I'd look upon His face   But here we are together   In this dreadful place   Chorus:   But I will praise the Lord   I will praise the Lord   No matter what tomorrow brings   Or what it has in store   I know I will praise the Lord   This may be a prison   These may be chains   Still I am free   Free to praise His name   In tribulation   My heart still sings   He is Messiah   He is the King of Kings   Prisoners started waking up   Singing filled their ears   Some men started swearing   Others were in tears   Then suddenly it happened   There was no mistake   As Paul and Silas praised the Lord   The walls began to shake   Chorus   1989 Shepherd Boy Musicascap..Got a good reason   For taking the easy way out   Got a good reason   For taking the easy way out now      She was a day tripper   A one way ticket yeah   It took me so long to find out   But I found out      She's a big teaser   She took me half the way there   She's a big teaser   She took me half the way there now      She was a day tripper   A one way ticket yeah   It took me so long to find out   And I found out      Tried to please her   She only played one night stands   Tried to please her   She only played one night stands, now      She was a day tripper   A sunday driver yeah   Took me so long to find out   And I found out      Day tripper   Day tripper yeah      Day tripper   Day tripper yeah      Day tripper.Early next morning about a half past nine   I spied a sheriff comin' down the line   Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat   He said come on you dirty hack into that district court      Into the court room my trial began   Where I was handled by twelve honest men   Just before the jury started out   I saw that little judge commence to look about..The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
"When will it make a sound   The sound....I've come home..You still got your shoulder holster   You still packin' yo' little friend   Well one thing's for certain   You're never gonna wipe that smile off my face again   Oh yeah.You are viewing lyrics of No One Needs To Know by avril lavigne from the album unknown at Lyricsandsongs..Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too   Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you   Outside, the snow is falling, and friends are calling, ""yoo-hoo!"".The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she’s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons."
"For some dumb fuck who don't got a clue   Another fine mess you got me into   Well you say I'm kicking up too much fuss   Twenty-four hours is too long on the bus   The band's all moan and the driver's slow   There's not enough people, too many shows   Down in the bus with the birthday blues   Another fine mess you got me into   Another fine mess, another fine mess, another fine mess   Well, that's what you get when you settle for less   Another fine mess, another fine mess   Oh, I said another fine mess, another fine mess, ohh   I said another fine mess, another fine mess   Another fine mess, another fine mess   Another fine, another fine, another fine, another fine   Another fine, another fine, another fine mess.I got a man who makes me want to die      We're all gonna burn in hell   I said we're all gonna burn in hell   Because we do what we gotta go   Yeah, well and we got the fever to tell   I said we got the fever to tell      Hey!.I've heard it said that the weight of the world's problems   Is enough to make the ball fall right through space   That it ain't even worth it to live   With all that's goin' wrong   Well, let me just go down as saying   That I'm glad to be here   Here with all the same pain   And laughs everybody knows   Some men think they're born to be king   Maybe that's true   But I think passing love around   Is all we were born to do   Let them build their kingdoms   Let them make the laws for this world to heed   'Cause you and I make life worth living   Right here in each other's arms   I'm here to love you, baby   No more loneliness, yeah   No more emptiness, oh   I'm here to love you, yeah, yeah   Let them build their kingdoms   Let them make the laws for this world to heed   'Cause you and I make life worth living   Right here in each other's arms   I'm here to love you, baby   No more loneliness, yeah   No more emptiness, oh   I'm here to love you   I'm here to love you   Just let me go on loving you   Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way   Just let me go on loving you   Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way   Just let me go on loving you   Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way   Just let me go on loving you   Don't stop me now while I'm feeling this way   Just let me go on loving you.I'd surrender everything   To feel the chance to live again   I reach to you   I know you can feel it too   We'd make it through   A thousand dreams I still believe   I'd make you give them all to me   I'd hold you in my arms and never let go   I surrender      Every night's getting longer   And this fire is getting stronger, baby   I'll swallow my pride and I'll be alive   Can't you hear my call   I surrender all      I'd surrender everything   To feel the chance to live again   I reach to you   I know you can feel it too   We'll make it through   A thousand dreams I still believe   I'll make you give them all to me   I'll hold you in my arms and never let go   I surrender      Right here, right now   I give my life to live again   I'll break free, take me   My everything, I surrender all to you      Right now   I give my life to live again   I'll break free, take me   My everything, I surrender all to you.Wake up in the morining with nothing to do   Gotta start the day off with a case of brew   Hit the street at noon with beer stinkin breath   Go down to the river with a 20 pack of green death   Liquored up and pissed off on a saturday   Night if the beer runs out theres gonna have to be a fight   Scrounging for change just to buy a half rack   Well I guess it beats smoking crack   Its quantity not quality that counts   Its best when its served in mass amounts   Rather spend the evening getting drunk   Than getting laid beer brigade   Falling down shit faced totally drunk   Stupid dirtyminded fucking river rat punx   Sitting around sluggin down the malt liqour   Listening to gg and trying to be sicker   Drinkin to get drunk who cares about taste   Pop a pigs eye and pour it in your face   Drinkin to remember just drinkin too forget   Drinkin cause we just don't give a shit   Beer brigade.The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant “dies” in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle."
"Last night I heard my own heart beating   Sounded like footsteps on my stairs   Six months gone and I'm still reaching   Even though I know you're not there   I was playing back a thousand memories, baby   Thinking 'bout everything we've been through   Maybe I've been going back too much lately   When time stood still and I had you      Come back, come back, come back to me like   You would, you would if this was a movie   Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out   Come back, come back, come back to me like   You could, you could if you just said you're sorry   I know that we could work it out somehow   But if this was a movie you'd be here by now      I know people change and these things happen   But I remember how it was back then   Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing   'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,   Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street   Flashback to a night when you said to me,   ""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you   Not before I knew how much I had to lose""      Come back, come back, come back to me like   You would, you would if this was a movie   Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out   Come back, come back, come back to me like   You could, you could if you just said you're sorry   I know that we could work it out somehow   But if this was a movie you'd be here by now      If you're out there   If you're somewhere   If you're moving on   I'll be waiting for you   Wary, since you've been gone   I just want it back the way it was before   And I just want to see you back at my front door   And I say      Come back, come back, come back to me like   You would before you say it's not that easy   Before the fight, before I locked you out   But I take it all back now   Come back, come back, come back to me like   You would, you would if this was a movie   Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out   Come back, come back, come back to me like   You could, you could if you just said you're sorry   I know that we could work it out somehow   But if this was a movie you'd be here by now      You'd be here by now   It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now   Baby, I don't like the ending   Oh, I thought you'd be here now, whoa   Thought you'd be here by now.Touche d'amour   Yours is a sunny day..The summer's gone, and all the roses falling..I know he's driving a fancy car   When you're with him   You're feeling like a star   But when I'm home alone I think only of you   So what do you know   How does it go      So how can he buy a love that's not for sale   If you two were so in love I couldn't tell, baby   Girl, but when I'm home alone I hear your heart, it spells   You gotta know   And how does it go      Who do you love   Who do you love   Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be   I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know   Who do you love   Who do you love   Oh yeah      So let's take some time out to find a way   Cuz there are just so many things I need to say   (So many things I need to say)   Cause when the lights are down and love is in the air   And I need to know   Do you really care   (Do you really care baby)      Who do you love (tell me who do you love)   Who do you love   Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be   I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know   Who do you love (oh yeah)   Who do you love   Oh yeah      Girl I find just I can't leave you alone   (Ain't nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong)   I promise I will make it back home   And if you're ever in need   Put your full trust in me   And I will never leave you at home      Who do you love (tell me who, yeah)   Who do you love (I need to know baby)   Girl I know that you are torn between what was and what could be   I wanna know, gotta know, wanna know, gotta know   Who do you love   Who do you love      Who do you love.Yeasterday has been and gone   Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain   Everybody's having fun except me I'm the lonely one   I live in shame      [Chorus]   I say goodbye to romance   Goodbye to friends   Goodbye to all the past   I guess we'll meet, we'll meet in the end      I've been the king, I've been the clown   Still broken wings can't hold me down   I'm free again   The jester with a broken crown   It won't be me this time around to love in vain      [Chorus]      And I feel the time is right although I know   That you just might say to me   What ya gonna do   What ya gonna do   'Cause I have to take this chance   Goodbye to friends and true romance   And to all of you   And to all of you      [Chorus]      And the weather's lookin fine and I think the sun will shine again   And I feel I've cleared my mind all the past is left behind again      [Chorus].There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up."
"Everything is perfect   Nothing's real....And boy is that great, you get to take messages for the secretary   Who never went to college   She's actually the bosses niece, so now your apart of the family   You know what college does for you?.This is love....Looks just like a sticker on a new Ferrari..Out of the bedroom door he looked and smiled      He said, ""Come inside and see your wife and child."".I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again."
"And kiss me?.Does it make you feel safer?.And about this time of every year,   The Line will go to the ocean pier,   And walk right off into the sea,   Then we fall asleep..How the hell can a person go to work in the morning   And come home in the evening and have nothing to say..I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine,   When out of that orange colored view   Wham, bam, alacazam, I got a look at you.. The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task"
"Hold us close, spin the dream,   The curtain will fall but behind it I see that you're here..Storms never last, do they, baby?.When we (bend) bend a new corner,   I feel like a (sweep) sweepstake winner..Bruce is now warming up the important muscles of the body, in preparation..I keep on walking in the daytime and in my eyes it's always night time,   And I like it when it's me at night,   'Cause that's when all the stars come out.. The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way."
"(Julie Miller)      When I go don't cry for me   In my fathers arms I'll be   The wounds this world left on my soul   Will all be healed and I'll be whole      Sun and moon will be replaced   With the light of Jesus' face   And I will not be ashamed   For my savior knows my name      It don't matter where you bury me   I'll be home and I'll be free   It don't matter where I lay   All my tears be washed away      Gold and silver blind the eye   Temporary riches lie   Come and eat from heaven's store   Come and drink and thirst no more      So weep not for me my friend   When my time below does end   For my life belongs to him   Who will raise the dead again      It don't matter where you bury me   I'll be home and I'll be free   It don't matter where I lay   All my tears be washed away.?.Some tricks   They go away   And other tricks   They're here to stay   (Oh don't you know me)   Sometimes my spirit's willin'   My flesh is weak and   That's what's killin'   Don't you believe   Anything he said   All them junkies talk that way   It's just as bad as it was before   I see the man knockin' at his back door   I said this kid's straight   And put on ice   The street corner deals at any price   Come on and check my veins   And check my eyes.So where you want to go today?.Your confusion,   My illusion,   Worn like a mask of self-hate,   Confronts and then dies.. I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  "
"Peeper: yes I do... Can't help myself..Moonlight and love songs   Never out of date..A fella needs a girl to sit by his side   At the end of a weary day   To sit by his side and listen to him talk   And agree with the things he'll say!.Upon the Bitter Green she walked the hills above the town   Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown   Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears   Waiting through the years      [Chorus]   Bitter Green they called her walking in the sun   Loving everyone that she met   Bitter Green they called her waiting in the sun   Waiting for someone to take her home      Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea   Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free   Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist   Dreaming of a kiss      [Chorus]      But now the Bitter Green is gone the hills have turned to rust   There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust   Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist   Dreaming of a kiss      [Chorus].Let me tell you about a girl I know   Had a drink about a hour ago   Sitting in a corner by herself, in a bar in downtown hell      She heard a noise and she looked through the door   And saw a man she'd never seen before   Light skin, light blue eyes, a double-chin and a plastic smile   Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door   And took an empty seat next to her at the bar   ""My brand new car is parked right outside   How'd ya like to go for a ride?"".The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on."
"Where have you been, all my life?.Since a thousand years   Until the holy land will come      Here I am the invisible man   A lost fallen angel helping mankind where I can   My memories are there to save your world   For you I'm just the invisible man      There's the destiny you don't know   I'm a guardian angel and whatever you'll go   You fight through your life not alone   You can't hear me, nor see me   But trust the holy flow      Here I am the invisible man   A lost fallen angel helping mankind where I can   My memories are there to save your world   For you I'm just the invisible man.Mia!.Mr. Shakur's Body has been removed from the hospital and funieral arrangments are pending..I'm singing Broadway and I love it!.I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test."
"[Intro]   Wallets, wallets, wallets, wallets, wallets   Y'all sleepin' in the streets   Shaky warrior   Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know   Boi-1da, what's poppin'?.Yet and still my name He called..So why do you smile   When you think about earl's court ?.[Chorus]   It was over 'fore it started, seemed so long when we began   Hope you take it like a friend..Even a drivin' wheel must come to rest some time..The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. "
"Isn't it nice to be someone   Someone you dream that you are?.My mind's been working overtime   Thinking of ways I'm gonna get to you   Rain or shine you'll be mine   And you know it'll be soon   'cause' I'll give you (give you) love that (lovin') you never dreamed of   I'll give you (give you) that and even more(lovin')   Face up to the fact   It's time to react   You'll be giving like you never before..Ashen-Lady..There is a passage through the darkness   And the mist   And though the body sleeps   The heart will never rest..Oh!.The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom."

For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test. “She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. “This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2."

She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."

She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph."
"Did my singing please you?.Show stopper, mind topper,   Show stopper, mind topper,   Show stopper, mind topper,   Show stopper, mind topper,   Show stopper, mind topper..Somewhere in the world that's what I must find..CHORUS   Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire,   Oooh, yeah-heh..Sinner!.Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  "

She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society."
"I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,   Just a little old shanty by a railroad track,   The hummin' of the drivers was my lullaby,   And a freight train whistle taught me how to cry..Just watch them swing   With the wind   Out to sea..And you're the girl to get me over what we start to be   And I just cant get over you, and until you're over me..Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry   All I want you to do is take me when I die   Well, well, well, so I can die easy   Well, well, well   Well, well, well, so I can die easy   Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up   Jesus gonna make up my dying bed..I think of things we used to do,   My whole world turns misty blue..All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence."
"It's in the way that you use it,   Boy don't you know..Yeah, but that's the way   You're gonna learn, learn, learn to love people, yeah..Time, time, time, time   Never ask what's become of us   Dedicate your sorrow   Here and now   To the soul the sea and me.A chair is still a chair   Even when there's no one sitting there..Special....I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her."
"Well my father is a farmer   A damn good one at his trade   And he's always loved my mama   Though we laid her in the grave      I've been down, I've been down   A hustler and a cheat   I'll always love my father   His kind heart can't be beat      I'd spit in your face if you laughed at me   Don't you know, don't you know   I might be a dipper, but I ain't a thief   Don't you know, don't you know      Oh yeah   Come on      Well my father is a farmer   Used to smack me on the ass   Used to dress me up in my Sunday best   Get down, get down to Sunday mass      And I've been down, so down   Don't you know, don't you know   I'll always love my father   I love him so.Your pants are groovy, and your hair's okay..I walk the thin line for you..ah   Sleeping with an angel..I cannot take this anymore   I'm saying everything I've said before   All these words they make no sense   I find bliss in ignorance   Less I hear the less you'll say   You'll find that out anyway      Just like before...      Everything you say to me   Takes me one step closer to the edge   And I'm about to break   I need a little room to breathe   Cause I'm one step closer to the edge   And I'm about to break      I find the answers aren't so clear   Wish I could find a way to disappear   All these thoughts they make no sense   I find bliss in ignorance   Nothing seems to go away   Over and over again      Just like before...      Every thing you say to me   Takes me one step closer to the edge   And I'm about to break!.The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver’s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again"
"I have the chaufeur hold the umbrella over my head when it's not rainin      [Outro:]   And we wanna let the world know   This is not a diss song either people   We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig   Recognize or step aside, ya dig   We let the music talk, Draught 3   And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back   It's Weezy!.[Chorus]   Some are born to greatness, some are born to fall   Some are bound to be forgotten like they never lived at all   But we're all born to know Him and stand before His light   Like the soldier who found his king tonight..'Cause you turn me on, your love's like a bomb, blowing my mind..But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals,   So easy to begin and yet impossible to end..Whatcha trying to say that haven't tried to say before?.Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past."
"What does it mean?.Wow!.My socks and shoes always match   Is It Luck?.I'm totally abandoned to You   I'm lost inside the rivers of Your love   I'm swept into the power of Your presence   Drawn toward the whisper of Your voice      Verse 2   I come to You in quiet adoration   And fall before Your feet You are my King   I'm living for the beauty of Your Presence   To behold the glory of Your face      CHORUS   Holy, Worthy, is the Lord   Heaven declares Your Rightousness   Oh God of All Creation   I worship You      Verse 2   CHORUS      Oh when You said 'seek Your face'   My heart said 'Your face I will seek' (2x).My friend Fats, he's a heck of a Joe..The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.” This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation."

The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."
"Morning comes and I'm alone ....One thought, one dream..But He loves me..I'm just another back street kid   Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig   Can't stop the music going round inside my head   I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead   Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me      Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine   Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been   Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room   Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom   Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me      Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going   Got to see yourself in other's eye's, surprised?.And now you want to marry me   You want to take me down the aisle   You want to throw confetti fingerprints   You know that's not my style      O sure I'd like to marry you   But I can't face the dawn   With any girl who knew me   When my fingerprints were on      Fingerprints, fingerprints   Where are you now my fingerprints?.In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the story with the quote ""when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother ""comes back"" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again."
"She's a wonderful lady   And she's mine, all mine   And there doesn't seem a way   That she won't come and lose my mind   It's too easy humming songs   To a girl in a yellow dress   It's been a long time since the party   And the room is in a mess      The four kings of EMI are sitting stately on the floor   There are birds out on the sidewalk   And a valet at the door   He reminds me of a penguin   With few and plastered hair   There's talcum powder on the letter   And the birthday boy is there      Why don't you cut your hair?.My life is one big smile   As I cross off the things on my list   The splendor goes on for miles   I don't know what could be left to wish   I'm just living the dream   I do all right if you know what I mean      [Chorus:]   And I've closed the door   And locked it tight   And turned off every single light   Another perfect day is all but through   Now me getting over you   Is the one thing left to do   Yeah, yeah, yeah   The whole world has gone insane   The paper says so every day   And I can always feel the rain   Even when the sun's in the way   Yeah just living the dream   I wish my eyes could forget what they've seen      [Chorus:]   I've closed the door   And locked it tight   And turned off every single light   And walked away just like you asked me to   Now me getting over you   Is the one thing left to do   Yeah I know that it's me who's not well   But there's no one but you I can tell      [Chorus:]   As I close the door   And lock it tight   And turn off every single light   And walk away just like you asked me to   But me getting over you   Is the one thing left to do   Yeah, yeah, yeah   Is the one thing left to do.Nestled in your wings my little one   This special morning brings another sun   Tomorrow see the things that never come   Today      When you see me   Fly away without you   Shadow on the things you know   Feathers fall around you   And show you the way to go   It's over, it's over..We're having a heat wave,   A tropical heat wave,   The temperature's rising,   It isn't surprising,   She certainly can can-can..Hoverin' by my suitcase   Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night   A heavy rain a fallin' seems   I hear your voice a callin' it's all right   On this rainy night in Georgia   A rainy night in Georgia      I believe it's rainin' all over the world   Neon signs a flashin' taxicabs and buses   Passin' through the night   The distant moanin' of a train   Seems to play a sad refrain onto the night   On this rainy night in Georgia   Such a rainy night in Georgia      I think, it's rainin' all over the world   How many times I have wondered   But it always comes out the same   No matter how I look at it'll think about it   It's just like some of its pleasures   Some of its pain      I find me a place in a boxcar   So I take out my guitar to pass some time   Late at night when it's hard to rest   I hold your picture to my chest   And then I'm all right   But it's still a rainy night in Georgia   It's a rainy night in Georgia      I believe it must be rainin' all over this world   All over the world rainy night in Georgia.The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved"
"We he turned away before the answer   Though I yelled aloud he refused to hear   It became to clear   So it went as we put out   I was left in constant doubt   Everything I asked about seemed private      The captain strolled the bridge one night   I stopped him in the evening light   To ask him would it be all right to join him      But he stood there like some idol   And he listened like some temple   And then he turned away      All along the fateful coast   We moved silent like a ghost   The timeless sea, a tireless host possessed us   The wind came building from the cold northwest   And soon the waves began to crest   Crashing cross the forward deck   All hands lost      I alone survived the sinking   I alone possessed the tools   On that ship of fools.Just about run out of time..I won a frock and undies, she was left I declare   As bare as any savage and as savages are bear   She laughed when I started to play,   But she didn't laugh again that day..I can only give you love that lasts forever   And the promise to be near each time you call   And the only heart I own for you and you alone   That's all, that's all      I can only give you country walks in springtime   And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall   And a love whose burning light   Will warm the winter night   That's all, that's all      There are those, I am sure, who have told you   They would give you the world for a toy   All I have are these arms to enfold you   And the love time can never destroy      If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear   You'll be glad to know that my demands are small   Say it's me that you adore, for now and evermore   That's all, that's all.Let's close our eyes   And make our own paradise   Little we know of it   Still we can try   To make a go of it   We might have been meant for each other   To be or not to be, let our hearts discover   Let's fall in love   Why shouldn't we fall in love?.Confidence, persistance, memories – all things that Saeng has “that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, “then I will take that test again,” shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won’t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saeng’s life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country."

Mark: Me too, I won't even care 'bout the part where it goes ""what can I say about this elixir?"".The author of “Winter Hibiscus”chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She says, “I will take that test again”. The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied. The hibiscus in the sentence ""…when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” @CAPS1 starting over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to highlight the theme and symbolize a new start"
"[Chorus:]   Don't you try and stop us now   I just refuse   Don't you try to stop us now   'Cause I just won't let you      Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me   Breaking me down with an endless monotony   Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me   All things are possible, I am unstoppable      So they convince you no one can break through   I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you      [Chorus:]      Sometimes I feel like my life's a catastrophe   Can't understand why it seems like it has to be   Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me   Nothing's impossible, I am unconquerable      No one can make you do what they want to   You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you      [Chorus:]      So they convince you no one can break through   You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you      [Chorus: Repeat 2X].I want to take you down   I want to take you down   I want to take you right down   I....Honey, that's exactly what it felt like,   Honey, just dragging me down..Anyone who sees her, soon forgets the Mona Lisa      It would take I know, a Michelangelo   And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above   To try and paint a portrait of my love      It would take I know, a Michelangelo   And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above,   To try and paint a portrait of my love.We fall apart!.I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way."
"American dream, American dream..we need all the ladies to hit the dance floor (Dominicanas)   If you got a big (todas las Cubanas)   Ol' booty and you like to shake (Mexicana)   That mother   Let's go   Pitbull, Lil John   Let's go (Boriqua)      Esa jevita esta enterita, tiene tremendo culo   Esta tan linda, esta tan rica y tiene tremendo culo   Que rica chiquita pero que importa si tiene tremendo culo   Hazme el favor y meneate chica, tienes tremendo culo      Pull up to the club, walk in than I   Pull to the bar get drinks than I   Pull up to a broad let her know what it is,   How it is, why it is what it is   I ain't got time for no games..Some people live each week in fun and play   From sweat by you and by me   While we must toil so long each day   Just to stay alive and free      Some people live in homes, so content and reposed   Unrushed through all the woe   While we share that woe   With those who have no woe at all      Some people live with much and care the least   If war should end or stay   While we, with less, pay more for peace   Uum, why should it be this way ?.Holy, holy, holy   (You are)   Holy, holy, holy   Holy, holy, holy   I want to see you..And I was gripped by that deadly phantom   I followed him through hard jungles   As he stalked through the back lots   Strangling through the night shades      The thief of life   Moved onwards and outwards to love      In a one stop only motel   A storm bangs on the cheapest room   The phantom slips in to spill blood   Even on the sweetest honeymoon      The killer of love   Caught the last late Niagara bus      By chance or escaping from misery   By suddenness or in answer to pain   Smoking in the dark cinema   You could see the bad go down again      And the clouds are high in Spanish mountains   And a Ford roars through the night full of rain..The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers’ test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime."
"And after all's been said and done   Who said it best, were you the one?.It's all show business kid   These trials, the whole world, show business   But kid, you're workin' with a star, the biggest      Give 'em the old razzle dazzle   Razzle dazzle 'em   Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it   And the reaction will be passionate      Give 'em the old hocus pocus   Bead and feather 'em   How can they see with sequins in their eyes?.(yes, we could)   I say goodbye to all my expectations   The day you walked out of my life..When I feel that the world's too much for me   I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me..And the white house burned, burned, burned..The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects."
"Everybody in the whole cell block   Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock..I've been struck by blindness      If I close and concentrate   You illuminate your body slide   And I let you do the worst mistake   It's clear as day   But I can't wrap my mind around it baby   And when I open my eyes   Then world is gone, long gone, long gone   Reached out when I heard you call my name   But all I felt was cold      Tell me why can't I see you?.White Lightning   It's so dangerous   White Lightning   No promises, no guarantees   White Lightning   When you come down here   You're already on your knees.The ""I do""s and the kisses from a miss to a misses   Can't wait for forever to stop      Let's set set the date!.Why do you hide, baby, why do you hide your love?.The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     "
"And kiss my lips anymore   She's gonna leave me   And she don't believe me   That I'll be true now      Well maybe she don't love me   And is not thinkin' of me   But why'd she do it this time of year?.Keg in the closet, pizza on the floor   Left over from the night before   Where we were going we didn't really care   We had all we ever wanted   In that keg in the closet....Ooh that sounds good, why don't you turn that up   Baby      (Listen) Pay attention are you listening   Hey you're my favorite girl   Excuse me for a moment, I'm in another world   On a mountain, by a fountain, flowers blooming everywhere   With Venus and with Cupid, the pictures very clear      Chorus:   Hang the sign up on the door   I say don't disturb this grove   All I need is just me and you   Just a way to say that I'm so into you   Just someone who understood   And the feelings so real   Don't disturb this grove      Erotic whispers for the listener   Let the music fill the air   Excuse me for a moment I'm at a loss for words   By election you're perfection   And as if these eyes would care   Your heart is in the right place so don't you go and change      Baby over and over the passion starts again   And the lollipops and everything with a little taste of sin   Causing fire and desire in this mortal soul to live   'Till the angels fall from heaven and the day the earth stands still      Chorus:   Hang the sign up on the door   It says don't disturb this grove   All I need is just me and you   Just a way to say that I'm so into you   Just someone who understood   And the feelings so real   Don't disturb this grove   All I need is just me and you   Cause I want to say that I'm so into you   Just someone who understood   And the feelings so real   Don't disturb this grove      Bridge:   Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood   Oooh baby just lock the door and turn the phone off   It's time for me and you      Chorus:   Hang the sign up on the door   It says don't disturb this grove   All I need is just me and you   Just a way to say that I'm so into you   Just someone who understood   And the feelings so real   Don't disturb this grove   All I need is just me and you   Cause I want to say that I'm so into you   Just someone who understood   And the feelings so real   Don't disturb this grove      It's the feeling girl (repeat).Ask me how do I feel, little me with my quiet upbringing   Well sir, all I can say is if gate I'd be swinging!.So glad you like 'em   The secret's in the cheese   It's casual entertaining   We aim to please   At my parties      Now don't talk to me about the polar bear   Don't talk to me about ozone layer   Ain't so much of anything these days, even the air   They're running out of rhinos   What do I care ?.The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better."
"The beauty spot was borrowed and   Now my sweet knife rusts tomorrow..Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,   Why not negotiate and try to be civilized?.How did things get so bad?.""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried..All because he had no home..The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about. It is about how Saeng misses home and filed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. She let herself by the flower and remember her home. That make her sad. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story. It shows her getting used to the new home"
"You pick out your credit cards and check into the night   A dozen tequilas and you're feeling alright   So you swim to the disco, out of your depth, jaded gigolo   Your lucky charms are tarnished so you leave alone   But there's one place left to go before the taxi home   After all, you made your marks      One night you'll play Elizabeth Taylor   The next night you're Marilyn Monroe   Forever kissing frogs that think they're princes   Oh Lady Nina, where did all the romance go?.Let me look into your eyes Josie   Count the stars along the Milky Way   I won't leave you, not tonight Josie   If you'll try to love me, try to love me   Show me you do   The way that I love you      When I look into your eyes Josie   The world of man is very far away   Stay with me and let me hear you say   That you'll try to love me, try to love me   Show me you do   The way that I love you.(Cuz' tonight)   We're going in the club,   Bring all the friends we've got,   We party like yeee yeee..It's to big to hide and it can't be denighed..Arunjuez, the dry and faded leaves,      In Arunjuez, my love,   You and I..The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes."
"Cowboy, come on and take me home   Gonna cowboy up and down, honey, all night long?.work it back..[Chorus: x2]      When the smoke had blown away   There was nothing left to view   Except a man dear Lord who looked like you   Floating high up in the sky.Oh have you been to Avondale and lingered in her lovely   Vale   Where tall trees whisper low the tale of avondale's proud   Eagle   Where pride and ancient glory fade   Such was the land where he was laid   Like Christ was thirty pieces paid   For Avondale's proud eagle      Oh have you been to Avondale and lingered in her lovely      Vale   Where tall trees whisper low the tale of avondale's proud   Eagle   Long years that green and lovely glade   Have lost for now our grandest Gael   And Cursed the land that has betrayed   Our Avondale's proud eagle.And nobody knows him, and nobody cares,   Cause there's no hidin' place,   There's no hidin' place   For you and me..The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time."
"Buon Natale, means Merry Christmas to you   Buon Natale to everyone, Happy New Year and lots of fun   Buon Natale, may all your wishes come true   Buon Natale in Italy means a Merry Christmas to you      Far away across the sea in sunny Italy   There's a quaint little town   Not a clock has been wound   For over a century      They don't know the time or year   And no one seems to care   And this is the reason the Christmas season   Is celebrated all year      Oh, Buon Natale, a Merry Christmas to you   Buon Natale to everyone, Happy New Year and lots of fun   Buon Natale, may all your wishes come true   Buon Natale to Italy means a Merry Christmas to you.I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused..Did ya ever think that it would get this bad?.She rides in the front seat,   She's my older sister   She knows her power over me   She goes to bed an hour later than I do   When she turns the lights out   What does she think about?.Pull myself together, put on a new face..In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again” because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng."
"Try to leave your tears after all   Bring 'em in to show everyone   We can get to the bottom of this bottle   We could end of this burning toll   Roll up now, roll it up another one,   And another fall through before..I'm going back to that same old used-to-be,   Down in Joe browns coal mine..If this is the last time..When two tribes go to war   One point is all that you can score.M sure that it will take some time   Until?.The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything’s going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it’s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph."
"Got some kicks, want to take a ride?.[Chorus x 3]      When you rock and roll with me   There's nowhere else I'd rather be   When you rock and roll with me   There's nowhere else I'd rather be.If you believe all your hope is gone   Down the drain of your humankind   The time has arrived   You'll be waiting here as I was   In a snow-white shroud   Waiting underground      There by the ridge be a gathering beneath the pilgrim moon   Where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth   Where the great ones tremble   In their snow-white shrouds   Waiting underground      If you seek the kingdom come, come along   Waiting by the ridge there'll be a gathering   Beneath the pilgrim moon   Where the [railroad] thunders      Oh where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth   And as the earth resounds where the great ones tremble   And your humankind becomes as one   And then we will arise   In our snow-white shrouds   When we'll be as one   But until that day we will just await   In our snow-white shrouds   Waiting underground   In our snow-white shrouds   Waiting underground      Waiting underground   Waiting underground   Waiting underground   Waiting underground   Waiting underground   Waiting underground.Honey, just close your eyes..Oh I've seen them myself, and you could not in truth,   Say if they were bound for a ball or a bath   Don't be starting them fashions now, marry machree   Where the mountains of mourne sweep down to the sea      You remember young peter o'loughlin, of course   Well, now he is here at the head of the force   I met him today, I was crossing the strand   And he stopped the whole street   With one wave of his hand   And there we stood talking of days that are gone   While the whole population of london looked on   But for all these great powers, he's wishful like me   To be back where dark mourne sweeps down to the sea      There's beautiful girls here - oh never you mind!. In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”. But I know this because its says “Then I will take that test again” her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus. "
"Leaving all my dreams behind,   Wonder who my prince will be?.On the lake,   The deep forbidden lake,   The old boats go gliding by,   And the leaves   Are falling from the trees   And landing on the logs and I   See the turtles   Heading for the bog   And falling off the log..I like your brother   I like your mother   And I like you !.Because me rock the reggae music in a different stylee..Superstar in your own bright movie   I wanted just a minor part   But I'm no fool   I know you're cool   I never really wanted your heart. The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country."
"We ain't gonna say nothing more, we gonna get with ya'll, on side   That's how it's suppose to be   So all that straggling in the gate trying to get close to me   Y'all niggas need to stop   Trying to flip the hip hop scrip   I snap and crackling, POP   Tell your friends and folks   It's a whole new year and situation and I'm still hating hoes   Will it ever stop?.I just walked down the street to the coffee shop   Had to take a break   I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight   I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk   Pushing up through the concrete   Like it was planted right there for me to see   The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns   All seemed to fade away   In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08   I saw God today      [Chorus]   I've been to church   I've read the book   I know He's here, but I don't look   Near as often as I should   Yeah, I know I should   His fingerprints are everywhere   I'd just slow down to stop and stare   Opened my eyes and man I swear   I saw God today      I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands   Man, she had that glow   Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show   It stood there for a minute takin' the sky   Lost in that sunset   A splash of amber melted in the shades of red      [Chorus]      I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass   She's sleeping like a rock   My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks   She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes   My brand new baby girl   She's a miracle   I saw God today.Add it up,   The only thing subtracted is the love I had for you   So add it up, oh   Add it up, oh   Add it up, oh   Add it up, oh      Symbols of perversion and insanity   Symbols of social immorality   Symbols of economic cruelty   Symbolize all what you did to me      Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci   Cartier, Cartier   Gucci, Gucci, Gucci   Cartier, Cartier      Money can't cover up the fact you're getting older every day   And you can't disguise your sad little eyes that give your loneliness away      Add it up, oh   Add it up, oh   Add it up, oh   (repeat).Stay up late..You should've known.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test."
"Forgive me..(Oh, oh, oh, yeah)      ""Good night, boys and girls!"".Stick your arm for some real fun   So your sickness weighs a ton   And God's name is smack for some.It's sunshine life for me   If I could get away from this cloud over me   Seems to just follow me around      There's a good life had for free   When you're out in the country   That's what I could use   If I could get away there soon      It's a sunshine life for me   If I could get away from this cloud over me   Seems to just follow me around      There's a good life had at sea   If you're not in the navy   That's the life for you   Sail away raymond, sail away      Now most folks just bore me   Always imposing, and I'd rather meet a tree   Somewhere out in the cornfield      And it's a sunshine..( Couples parked in cars were romancin' )   They were romancin'   But we kept right in dancin!. The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom."
"Are you trying hard, are you on the rise?.Times change very quickly,   and you had to grow up early,   A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet..Deep down in the depths of forgotten dreams   So far away, so long ago it seems   The memory comes of a distant beach   Pale sand stretching far from reach   It was then I found my princess of the sand   As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet   I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet   She came to me and I saw in her eyes   The heavy toll of a thousand eyes   I called her my princess of the sand   She stared at me and my mind was in a maze   As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze   She moved her mouth but there came no sound   The message she brought can never be found   But I called her my princess of the sand   One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face   Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace   Where she went or came from who can know   Or if she'll ever return to help me know   Who she is, my princess of the sand   Sometime when the summer nights come back   I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track   I'll look around, hope to find   That strange young dream, close behind   I'll call her my princess of the sand.'Twas the night before Christmas   And all through the house   Not a creature was stirring   Not even a mouse      In my mind, I want you to be free   For all of our friends, to listen to me   Now hear what I say   We wish you a Merry Christmas   To each one of you      Silent night, holy night..Vocal Under A Bloodlight   Last night you said I was cold, untouchable   A lonely piece of action from another town   I just want to be free, I'm happy to be lonely   Can't you stay away?.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way."
"Everybody loves somebody sometime   Everybody falls in love somehow   Something in your kiss just told me   That sometime is now      Everybody finds somebody someplace   There's no telling where love may appear   Something in my heart keeps saying   My someplace is here      If I had it in my power   I'd arrange for every girl to have you charms   Then every minute, every hour   Everybody would find what I found in your arms      Everybody loves somebody sometime   And though my dreams were overdue   Your love made it all worth waiting   For someone like you      If I had it in my power   I'd arrange for every girl to have you charms   Then every minute, every hour   Everybody would find what I found in your arms      Everybody loves somebody sometime   And though my dreams were overdue   Your love made it all worth waiting   For someone like you.Wake the fuck up!.(The fire, the wars, the chaos, the currents.).Ashes to ashes and you can't bust   You so popcorn and fake industrious, yeah!.I still dream of you wakin' up, openin' your eyes   Like a little girl I once knew   Walkin' to the window, lookin' down on the street   You walk with me, and I walk with you      Well I thought it all over, it doesn't make any sense   Why did it fall apart, when it seemed so innocent?.The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story."
"I need to unwind..Light the sky, the glow above..I'm begging you      The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it   And he knew what to do with it, everybody saw it   Saw the dust that he made      King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow   Got the horn good to go, wait, oh his sting's all gone   Now he's begging you, begging you      Here is a warning, the sky will divide   Since I took off the lid, no, there's nowhere to hide   Now I'm begging you, begging you      This is a mystery not to be solved   But be minded, like minded, I'm gone, still I'm with you   I'm begging you, begging you      Give it over, give it over   Give it over, give it over   Give it over, give it over   Give it over, give it over   Yeah I'm begging you (I'm begging you)   Give it over, give it over   Give it over   Yeah, I'm begging you, I'm begging you      Weigh it and say it, is it all in a name   Does it call you or maul you and drive you insane   Can it make you remember, time is a place   How I'm begging you, I'm begging you      The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it   And he knew what to do with it, everybody saw it   Saw the dust that he made      Make all the dust that you can   Make all the dust that you can      King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow.I wrecked my Lincoln in Saint Jo   Why to little old Cairo?.And I wonder, will you digest me?.The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""I’d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."
"It will be too long..But this time's our time   Right on!.We'll snap for your slice of life I'm tellin' ya why   I hear that mother nature's now on birth control   The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to ho   The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll   Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go nowhere 2 go      Officer of the most high   You touch me you touch the apple of this eye   If they kick us out where will we go   Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as they kin folk   Still eatin' pork   Abomination desecration for beating flesh   Penalty for violation is death   Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on judgment day   Hip Hip Hooray!.I want it all..Bikes and vans   Fly by me on the desert   But I'm all right   Standing out here in the hot sun   When I see the light   I feel like more than just a number   And I stand before you   Or else we just don't see the other   Computer age computer age   Computer age.. The concluding paragraph explains her next goal. She had to take a test but failed it. Paid over nineteen dollars for the plant. It reminded her of her old home. She will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also."
"Hey, wait a minute something just ain't right hey, wait a minute   Something's just not fair   I was supposed to win the lottery   I'm supposed to be a millionaire   I'm supposed to be a worldwide tourist   With lots of equity and life insurance   Yes I'm supposed to be a gold card member   Rubbin' elbows with the big time spenders   I'm supposed to be a wealthy man   But all I've got are blistered hands   Hey, wait a minute!.but I'm gonna, I keep toastin' the armor   For niggas who supposed to be drama   I mostly just wanna, get fed garlic toast and lasagna   Get head while I'll roast in a sauna   F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S, how can you hate that?.[Chorus]      Money (money), Money (money)..I've got two long legs like to carry me,   Two sharp eyes to look for the fight..If it ain't broke, break it!. The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don’t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner’s permit test. Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up."
"No such thing as heaven   And I'm the last girl on Earth   So, baby, let's get it on      Cleopatra used to rule   But she got nothing on me now   'Cause I'm the last girl on Earth..I've looked into the heart of darkness   Where the blood red journey ends   When you've faced the heart of darkness   Even your soul begins to bend      For a week I have been waiting   Still I am only in Saigon   The walls move in a little closer   I feel the jungle call me on      Every minute I get weaker   While in the jungle they grow strong   What I wanted was a mission   And for my sins they gave me one      They brought it up just like room service   Cause everyone gets what they want   And when that mission was all over   I'd never want another one      I know, captain that you've done this work before   We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure   The colonel's gone rogue   and his methods are unsound   You'll take a PBR up river track him down      There's a conflict in every human heart   And the temptation is to take it all too far   In this war things get so confused   But there are some things which can not be excused      He's acting like a god an insane lunatic   Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice   The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow   Here is the file and it's all you need to know      Here I am the knife in my hand   And now I understand why the genius must die      Now I stand alone in darkness   With his blood upon my hands   Where sat the warrior the poet   Now lie the fragments of a man.You don't want a round three?.Has there ever been a moment   With so much to live for?.I must admit   I can't remember your name   I know we just met,   But since then I've had a lot to think about   Before we part ways, well, there's something that I'd like to say   I realize it's late   But if you'll hear out I'm sure   Dave Letterman can wait   And if you'd like to   Maybe continue, what we started with a smile   From across the room   That'd be fine with me   When I first saw      Your face, I knew for sure   That from now on   Things would be different than before   I walk in weak   From yet another day   I need you to say   That tomorrow I'm gonna hear your voice again   And if you'd like to, maybe continue,   What we started with a smile from across the room   That'd be fine with me   And I only hope that I can be what you were looking for   Cause all I ask is that you look my way   And that'd be fine with me   I know it's clich.In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”."
"The people here have all been good to me..I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe..We are the fiend club.Seen you before, I know your sort   You think the world awaits your every breath   You'll be my friend, or so you say   You'll help me out when the time comes      And all the time we're getting rich   You hang around to help me out      But when we're skint, oh God forbid!.Hey   I got what you need right here   I got what you need right here   I got what you need right here   I got what you need right here      Uh, turn up the eight o eights for me   Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me   Now I do it big and that's my day to day story   I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry   Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly   Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me   They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue   I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew   See, when you're spittin' so real   Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal   Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal   Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell   At times I watch the news and see they talkin' bout diplomacy   And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see   Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be   I think they scared of me, and they should be      [Chorus].The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."
"Hey bully   Oh, strike   Lightning      Hey, Chi man   That melody is Puerto Rican   Hey Chi man, is what he's speaking   And there's the road down into London Town where many cars get broken down   It's the Westway from Ladbroke Grove   Runs down to Old Hounslow   Hash my brother, caught a fuff   Because, because you know it   Just thought I'd mention the new extention that run's down the 59th street intersection   Did you hear the news y'all?.(that's all just everything)   I want to be your everything!.High climbs the summer sun   High stands the corn   And tonight when my work is done   We will borrow your father's carriage   We will drink and prepare for marriage   Soon my darling, soon my darling      [Chorus:]   Shilling for the fellow who brings the sheep in   Shilling for the fellow who milks the herd   Shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping   How can we feed love on a farmboy's wages?.Just don't stop the beat   No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight   K-C you feeling me right?.No, woman, no cry.).For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ‘’when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     "
"I made mistakes, you always knew that I would learn..Look in!.Soon to become a victim of what you live to create, and cannot have..Have you ever been experienced?.Give me the gift of love..The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."
"In America you'll get food to eat   Won't have to run through the jungle   And scuff up your feet   You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day   It's great to be an American   Ain't no lions or tigers-ain't no mamba snake   Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake   Everybody is as happy as a man can be      Climb aboard, little wog-sail away with me   Sail away, sail away   We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay   Sail away, sail away   We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay      In America every man is free   To take care of his home and his family   You'll be (as) happy as a monkey in a monkey tree   You're gonna be an American   Sail away, sail away   We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay   Sail away, sail away   We will cross the mighty ocean to the Charleston Bay.Ooh, yeah, you're amazing!.I study in your schools..[Q-Tip]   ""Yeah..You know, I've got to get   That man, that man   (Man in the mirror)   You've got to move!.In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted."
"Yeah   Come on!.She's my sweet Beatrice   She's my sweet Beatrice   She's my sweet Beatrice   And she's coming home   Well, for sure she opened the door   Whipped out a 3-ft fishing lure   Sexually, that made me insecure   Like the time I was a roadie   On Elton John's tour   She said, ""Let's go catch some Piscatore!"".Baby, do you remember   Every morning   We would dress   And we'd be still yawning,   In the street   Where people meet   We would wander around   In the northern heat..Dad the time has come for me to leave your side..Worthy to receive glory,   Worthy to receive honor,   Worthy to receive all our praise to-day..Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower."
"Oh oh yea yea      I love you more than I can say   I'll love you twice as much tomorrow   Oh love you more than I can say      Oh oh yea yea      I miss you ev'ry single day   Why must my life be filled with sorrow   Oh love you more than I can say      Don't you know I need you so   Tell me please I gotta know   Do you mean to make me cry   Am I just another guy      Oh oh yea yea      I miss you more than i can say   Why must my life be filled with sorrow   Oh love you more than I can say      Oh don't you know I need you so   So tell me please I gotta know   Do you mean to make me cry   Am I just another guy      Oh oh yea yea      I love you more than I can say   I'll love you twice as much tomorrow   Oh love you more than I can say      I love you more than I can say   I love you more than I can say (more than I can say)      I love you twice as much tomorrow (more than I can say)   I love you twice as much tomorrow      (More than I can say) I love you more than I can say   (More than I can say) I love you more than words can say yeah.It's a long time - oh I see no light on the forsaken..So here I am sitting...   Five days a week I'm giving,   My time is clocking on..Get back..""O God of Earth and Altar,   Bow down and hear our cry,   Our earthly rulers falter,   Our people drift and die,   The walls of gold entomb us,   The swords of scorn divide,   Take not thy thunder from us,   But take away our pride."".The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great."
"I look this way   And you're not there   If you dont mind   My soul out there      Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa      [Chorus]      Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papi   Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi   Mmm Luvi, Mmm Luvi, Mmm Papi      (You will always be there for me)   (You will always be there for me)      You love it when I'm freakin' out   Things get rough and there's no doubt   You love it when I'm freakin' out   Things get rough and there's no doubt      [Chorus]      Now see!.I'm only happy when I'm with you   I only feel good when I'm talking to you   And I'm a mess when you don't call me   Call me at night   Where did you go   Where did you go   And did you think of me      It's hard to breathe   And my heart's sinking   I'm slipping fast   As I am reaching for you   It's gonna hurt cause   I have been there before   Can't take much more   Can't take another night   Without you here beside me      [Chorus]   I want to review my kisses   On every inch of your body   I want to reveal my secrets   That only you should know   I feel all this pain inside me   That only your lips can make better   I want to review my kisses   So you won't forget that you are mine      Don't want to care   More than you do   Don't want to be the one   Who's out in the rain   Don't want to get that   Call where you sound so cold   So far away, so far away   Like the distant roll of thunder      [Chorus]      It's a cave in the darkness   And I'm lost inside you   Don't go      I want to review my kisses   On every inch of your body   I want to reveal my secrets   That only you should know   I feel like a childless mother   Longing to hold her baby   If I could review my kisses   Then you won't forget that you are mine.I only wish I had the strength to let it show..Sonst gar nichts..Now, he's underneath that apple suckling tree   Oh yeah!.The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life."

Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. "
"You must have more power than I know..Well the misery is yours,   If you hide behind that door,   If you hide behind the troubles[?].This little girl of mine   I wanna say that she's so fine   And each and every day   I make sure she has her way   Now we don't feel tied down   Although our hearts are bound   I don't have to chase her all over town   My baby she's always around      [Chorus: x2]   The girl's alright with me   You know the girl's alright      Now she's so good to me   I guess that's why I feel fancy free   Just to see the glow in her eyes   Makes me once again realize   I love her with all of my heart   And I know we'll never ever part   I never heard about or caught her playin'   I guess that's why you always hear me sayin'      [Chorus: x2]      When I visit at her home   Other fellas never, never ring her phone   She let's them know just where they stand   She tells them all that I'm her man   And when we're out on a date   All the fellas wait till I walk away   They try to beat my time   She tells them in a nice way she's mine, all mine      [Chorus].When you're tired of giving reasons   And freedom fighting freedom   If you're searching for an answer,   We can bring you back to Eden..Take your shoes off   And throw them in the lake!. I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life."
"You cry to weak friends that sympathize..uhh!.I'm sick of summertime   I know, all of the best things in life are unkind   To be everything I could be, anything   But all the time I'm thinking, ""If I only had a pair of wings...""   But you want touch me   Just get your hands off me   Don't touch me   And baby, I can't see that you see   How can you see?.Now you fronting so I gotta expose y'all to see   Ungrateful motherf-cker, who fed you when you was hurting?.Have you seen this face?.The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."
"If you don't want something lasting, if it's just the time you're passing   Lucky lady, give him up 'cause I do love him very much   Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady   I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady   Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady   Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady   Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady   Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady.Sign your 'X' on the line,   Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight..Goin' home, running' home, down the Gasoline Alley where I started from..Lo: Here with me you have a home   Ll Cool J: Time is of the essence, why spend it alone?.Keep it superficial before feelings can start   In a world that's all glitter and glow, what do they know?. The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting she chooses to try. and make their wew home work out. After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes."
"Whoa man, I'm everything I said I wouldn't be,   Standing here with nothing, will you help me?.Made myself a prisoner   I locked myself away   Can't remember the last time   I saw the light of day   Don't want to face life   Feel I've been betrayed   I want you to tell me   Where our love went astray      So can't you wait one more minute   Why can't you wait one more day   Let's get it straight   Cause it's a big mistake   You better think about it      I don't want to break it up   Why do we have to break it up   Never ever want to break it up oh no   I only want to make it up tonight      You say you've thought about it   But you sound so cold   You make it look like our love   Can be bought or sold   But you won't listen   You say it's way too late   That something is missing   And now you just can't wait      Why can't you wait one more minute   Why can't you wait one more day   Let's get it straight   This is a big mistake   We better think about it      I don't want to break it up   Why do we have to break it up   Never ever want to break it up oh no   I only want to make it up tonight      So don't say break it up   I want to hear you say we'll make it up   I don't want to break it up   Ooh baby why can't we make it up tonight   Make it up tonight      And I ask myself   What's wrong with me   How could I be so blind   Although she tried to give me everything   I still couldn't see   Now as I watch our love slip away   I'm beggin' you beggin' you please   Don't break it up   Take a little time and make it up   I don't want to break it up oh no   I only want to make it up tonight      I don't want to break it up   Baby let me make it up.Oh, yeah!.It couldn't be the ratings,   You had the best in town..[M3:] ""All right, Russel..The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready."
"Tora!.You want the beating of another man's heart..Welcome to the light   Now everything is okay   Run thro' the light of night   You run to the light of day..I know a guy who took too many pills   Now he's got a mansion that sits on a hill   14 million served that's correct   17 cars, 3 cribs, and 2 jets   I came to test to blood, sweat, tears   Persevered for ten long years   10 years, I was there for 8   And I ain't seen a meaner mother puttin' food on our plate   I've learned to hate, and that's a damn shame   Because I'm gettin' pretty good at this bitch ass game   See, fame ain't the problem, it's broke?.The towers of London, these crumbling rocks   Reality estates that the hero's got   And every hour's marked by the chime of a clock      And whatcha gonna do when the darkness surrounds?.The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  "
"Did you say you wanna dance with me?.Time flies!.Everything's different   But nothing has changed   Are we going in circles   It's Christmas again   Can't you hear the sleigh bells right?.Such a lovely sight to see..I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story."
"Hooray!.I cried a tear for nobody but you   I'll be a lonely one   If you should say we're through   Well, if you want to make me cry   That won't be so hard to do   If you should say goodbye   I'll still go on loving you   Each night I ask the stars up above   Why must I be a teenager in love?.The kids they come from all around   With the same look in their eyes   They're bruised and boozed with nothing to lose   Some don't care if they die      This world has pushed them   Beat them to the ground   Tonight it's different   We stand on equal ground      We are all that we have   No matter what they say   We are all that we have   And they can't take that away      See the circles form   Bodies flying left to right   Days of tensions fade away   Even if it's for one night      Controlled aggression   Your only release   Helps to numb depression   Real pain will never cease      We are all that we have   No matter what they say   We are all that we have   And they can't take that away      Outside these walls   You're a misfit, messed up kid, no one to trust   Outside these walls, you're an outcast   Here and now you're one of us      We are all that we have   (we are all!).[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]   Uh, smoke weed everyday      [Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]   Young niggas get rich   Rich niggas gon' ball   Y'all niggas ask prices   My niggas buy it all   Rockin' shit that's foreign   Driving brand new cars   Youngest nigga in charge   Now your bitch at large   Hol up, what they sayin'   OG Kush in my plane   Diamonds all in my chain   Young nigga doin' his thing   Young nigga gon' stunt   Buy whatever he want   My section very important   Came through the back, not the front (ooh!).We gotta play our love just right   I know you know the time will come   But baby for tonight      [Chorus]   Let's take it slow, so slow   Anywhere you want to go   Baby for you I'll lay it on the line   You oughtta know (oughtta know), boy I ain't got no where to go I'll give it to you, only to you   We gotta take it real slow      We got together you know I feel the fire..These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."
"Didn't I give you the month of June   Didn't I make it alright   When everything was ruined   Didn't I say didn't I   Didn't you say didn't I too   Didn't we both say didn't I   'Till didn't we say we're through   Didn't I try, didn't I cry   Didn't I?.Stripped my senses on the spot,   I've never been defenseless,   I can't even make sense of this..Sisters!.On the seventh day of Christmas,   My true love sent to me   Seven swans a-swimming,   Six geese a-laying,   Five golden rings,   Four calling birds,   Three French hens,   Two turtle doves,   And a partridge in a pear tree..Feel all right   (Can I get a witness?).The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."
"I walk a mile with a smile   And I don't know   I don't care where I am   But I know it's alright      Jump the tracks   Can't get back   I don't know anyone around here   But I'm safe this time      'cause when you   Tell me, Tell me, Tell me   Stupid things, like you do   Yes, I   Have to, have to, have to   Change the rules   I can't lose      [Chorus]   'Cause I shiver   I just break up   When I'm near you   It all gets out of hand   Yes I shiver   I get bent up   There's no way that   I know you'll understand      We talk and talk   'round it all   Who'd have thought   We'd end up here      But I'm feeling fine   In a rush   Never trust   You'll be there      If I'd only stop and take my time      'Cause with you   I'm running, running, running   Somewhere I can't get to   Yes I have to have to have to   Change the rules   I'm with you      [Chorus]      What if you get off at the next stop   Would you just wave as I'm drifting off   If I never saw you again   Could I (could i)      Keep all (all)   Of this (of this)   Inside      [Chorus: x2].Oh, skylark, i don't know, i don't know   If you can find these things,   But my heart, my heart is riding on your wings..We do what we want, yes, we do what we want..And tells me ""Baby, (Daddy) every thing's all right."".Calling out an SOS..The story like this for mine reasons. First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that."
"And without her,   It could never be christmas again....Oh man, I just had the hub caps painted!.All the while   They lie down,   Our lighter souls fuse,   Fly and dive, my love..If you're worrying 'bout a verse[?.Grew up in a small town,   And when the rain would fall down,   I'd just stare out my window..The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion."
"What's your middle name?.Why look at that moon?.Not me   Turned to the max, no sleep   Smoked a hundred joints to the face give a fuck what a bitch nigga say      E'rything about me ('bout me)   E'rything about me ('bout me)   E'rything about me, E'rything about me ('bout me)   E'rything about me ('bout me)   E'rything about me (what!).I got my eyes on the shit unfolding..Spent a long, long evening in a low down honky-tonk bar   Pulled a low down lady with a long black honky-tonk car   I asked no questions, I got no lies   A one off winner, I didn't want any ties   And I knew it wasn't right   Well, everybody has to sometimes break the rules   Took me down on the highway doing too many miles an hour   And by the way she motored thought we might have made the Eiffel Tower   She stopped the motor by her own front door   I knew she'd done it so many times before   But I was off of the floor   But everybody has to sometimes break the rules   I woke up next morning feeling kind of up and down   'Cos I did not know if I was in or out of the town   Then I saw the face from the night before   My purse was empty lying there on the floor   But like I told you before   That, everybody has to sometimes break the rules   I spend a low down evening sitting high on a honky-tonk stool   And I spent my money like a low down honky-tonk fool   But everybody has to sometimes break the rules   Well, everybody has to sometimes break the rules   Yes, everybody has to sometimes break the rules.  The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up."
"I think I'm getting a rise   On all her American thighs   Her American thighs..That's important   I will make my face a mask      And I'm thinking just in passing   What if this song does nothing?.The sky is painted black   The smoke pours out the stack   One hand upon your heart   One hand behind your back   You train us how to act   You keep the fear intact   The imminent attack   Everything is right on track      And we are letting you get away   We are letting you get away with it      Upon our plates to feed   The dying left to bleed   How much we really need   Your politics of greed   The cancer takes a hold   The wolf is in the fold   Our destiny's been sold   We do just what we're told      And we are letting you get away   We are letting you get away with it      Your armies filled with hate   Believing your charade   Begin to suffocate   For us it's far too late      And we are letting you get away   We are letting you get away with it.Things aren't what they used to be   I believe it...

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts."
"London Town, turn be around, London Town,   Carry me back, oh, London Town,   Lost and found, and I feel like going back..Have you heard the news?.It's a modern life   But it's not what you're looking for..Feliz Navidad   Feliz Navidad   Feliz Navidad   Prospero Ano why Felicidad..Give me something to believe in   Now there's fire outside, mud that slides   Earthquakes shake the region   Willy and the Poorboys lost in America   They ain't got nothing to believe in   For every seed of knowledge found   For every grain of reason   For every shred of decency   There's something to believe in   Now I lay me down to rest   In the silence of the evening   And the moon road shines from here to eternity   I've got something to believe in   You believe what you want to believe   Just stay true to your feelings   'Cause one man's god's just as good as another   I've got something to believe in.I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that."
"Rip it up   Move down   Rip it up   Move it down to the ground   Rip it up   Cool down      And get the feeling not the word..The passing of time   And all of its crimes   Is making me sad again   The passing of time   And all of its sickening crimes   Is making me sad again   But don't forget the songs   That made you cry   And the songs that saved your life   Yes, you're older now   And you're a clever swine   But they were the only ones who ever stood by you      The passing of time leaves empty lives   Waiting to be filled (the passing...)

The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away."
"Oh yeah, yeah..We get D-are-you-N-K   Lately since my baby left me   I do it almost every day   Well I tell ya Johnny   Its the only thing I've found   That'll take the pain away      How do we spell relief?.Oh, but deep down in my heart, I know our love will never grow..What you do not what you know!.I'm just thankful for the good times we've had   For without them I could not go on,   With all these funny familiar forgotten feelings   Walkin' all over my mind..The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again."
"Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.I remember you there at the table   Surrounded by all the days plans   Eyes flickering you're trying   To let a coffee cup warm your hands   Maybe we're born lost   Born to persevere   Honey I'd walk into your painting   Until I'd reappeared   A speck of comet-tail dust   A blue-green northern light   Flickering just in your eyes' deepest ravines   Goodnight goodnight Josephine   Goodnight, goodnight Josephine   Goodnight, goodnight Josephine   Goodnight, goodnight   Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight   Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight   Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight   Josephine, Josephine, Josephine, Josephine...Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love   Sayin' I been lookin' for you love   Surprise your new love has arrived   Out of the blue clear sky..Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend   Loving the love I love      To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said   Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold   And in between what might have been and what has come to pass   A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass      Where do your golden rainbows end?.the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring."

Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter."
"I'll keep a friend serene   (Will they come?).Save it all..Well, that's just fine   Say it once, say it twice   Take a chance and roll the dice   Ride with the moon in the dead of night      Everybody scream, everybody scream      In our town of Halloween!.Threw off your shoe, haul off the sow,   Dust off the words that shape from the tale..Time to get up   Make a move   Put the brain in gear   Cut the groove   Moving slow   With a smiling face   Never look like you want it   'Til it's right in your face      I'm the hustler   Playing my favorite game   Yeah I'm the hustler   Everybody knows my name      Well I can get all around you   While I think you stand still   The way you tell me you won't   Let's me know that you will   Last thing you tell them   Is what you came here for   They're never going to find out   'Til you way out the door   'cause I'm the hustler   Playing my favorite game   Yeah I'm the hustler   Everybody knows my name      You got to love the work you do   How long it takes   Ain't important to you   Don't care what's in it   Loving every minute   Every minute, every hour   Every second of the day   Little by little   I see it coming my way      I'm the hustler   Playing my favorite game   Yeah I'm the hustler   Everybody knows my name. The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over."

The writer wants to convey that no matter what your used to you can find something that can bring you happiness and a since of focus."

The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story."
"Ritorna quella bimba che sorrideva per me:   ?.I can't sleep, no not like I used to   I can't breathe in and out like I need to   It's breaking ice now to make any movement   What's your vice?.Who's Chariot?.ha   Cause this is my ground ah   And I'm dangerous ah   And you can get out ha   But it's all about me tonight (tonight, ha)      (Oh oh, oh) So you say I'm complicated   That I must be outta my mind ahhhh   But you've had me underrated   Rated, rated      (Ah ha) What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being   What's wrong with being confident?.Things will never be the same,   I may snuff the burning flame.. Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think at se was wereing about it doing spring because she whent to wacth the geese fly in a u shape and she whent to see the plant grow but the snow don’t melt yet. She started takeing to herself about it but she could whant to take at test doing spring. At if she can passed it again because she doesn’t like to take the test over and over again. When every body gets to the diffent thing after thee test is over."
"Maybe I didn't like to hear   But I still can't believe Speed Racer is dead   So then I thought I'd make some plans   But fire thought she'd really rather be water instead      And Peggy got a message for me   From Jesus   And I've heard every word that you have said   And I know I have been driven like the snow      This is cooling   Faster than I can   This is cooling   Faster than I can      But do I hate what she is   But do I want to be her   And don't we love something fresh   Anything new, virgin      Woman you got too many brambles   Hiding under these bushes   Woman you got too many brambles   But I always liked a good storm   I'm always good for a storm      So then love walked up to like   And said I know that you don't like me much   Let's go for a ride   This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree      And is your place in heaven   Worth giving up these kisses   These, these kisses      And Peggy got a message for me   From Jesus   And I've heard every word that you have said   And I know I have been driven like the snow, but      This is cooling   Faster than I can   Hey yes, faster than I can   Hey, this is cooling   This is cooling.Scumbag, baby,   Scumbag, baby, (scumbag, baby)   Scumbag, baby, (scumbag, baby)   Scumbag, (scumbag, baby)   Scumbag, (scumbag, baby)   Scumbag, oh yeah, (scumbag)   Scumbag (scumbag)   Scumbag (scumbag) (who's scumbag? ).Only takes me a day to,   Realize I'm in love with you..I don't run around, trying to be what's not within me..I'm not surprised   Not everything lasts   I've broken my heart so many times,   I stopped keepin' track..The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas."
"Yes I do      [Chorus]   Yes, I do dream of all we had together   Yes it's true we lost it all forever?.Where were you   When I wanted you to love and hold me tight?.And the season comes around   Once more, once more..Prophets of old his coming foretold and men ever praise his name..In twilight time, dream with me awhile..The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that’s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons."
"It's said to be and not to be in love   Is to regret   Regret [Repeat: x3]      [Chorus]      Should I try to take you in   Who'll pity me in my regret?.Maybe I will find today   Maybe I will lose tomorrow   Gonna rock on to the oceanside   Did you ever see into the future?.Right or wrong for you.Weak or strong for you..I'M GOIN' TO KANSAS CITY, KANSAS CITY, HERE I COME..(Straight to you)   Hm      Clap, clap, clap   Clap, clap, clap   Clap, clap, clap      (Just let me know)   And I'll (ah, come back) come running back..The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring."
"If there's sand that you ain't wrote your name in   If you're tired of the view from the same window   If there's lips that you wanna get drunk on   Ferris wheels that you need to get stuck on, go   See everythin' you think you need to see   Then come back to me      If there's pavement you ain't put your shoes on   If there's dance floors you ain't made a move on yet   If you're feelin' too safe here beside me   And you wanna do somethin' you might regret   Try the whole world on if you feel the need   Then come back to me      [Chorus]   I wouldn't want   You to miss a thing   I wouldn't wake   You from any dream   You ever have   So, go on, and go, unroll every map   But if you gotta leave   You gotta know   I love you enough   To let you go   If there's greener grass   Hey, I wanna hold you, but I don't wanna hold you back      If you fly like a bird in the Jetstream   Hope the sky is a Hollywood set scene blue   If you land with a tan and your shades on   Hope the promise the postcard made comes true   But if it ain't all that you dreamed it to be   Come back to me      [Chorus]      If you find someone else who deserves you   Hope he loves you enough not to hurt you   But if he does, you know right where I'll be   Come back to me.Oh get me on my feet   Get me off the streets (get some protection).Here I am   Just like I said I would be   I'm your friend   Just like you think it should be   Did you think I would stand here andlie   As our moment was passing us by   Oh I am here      Waiting for your change of heart   It just takes a beat   To turn it around   Yes I'm waiting for you change of heart   At the edge of my seat   Please turn it around      Days go by   Leaving me with a hunger   I could fly   Back to when we were younger   When adventures like cars we would ride   And the years lied ahead still untried   While I stand here      Waiting for your change of heart....Let's get to it   Make it happen   Need your touch oh so much   Don't you see   Let's get to it right away      Let's get the sun in our day   Let's turn a spark to a flame   Let's get this thing on the move   My heart is longing to prove      That maybe without you   The world will grow colder   Come on let's do it   Before we're much older      [Chorus]   Let's get to it right now   Make it happen somehow   Need your touch oh so much   Don't you see what I'm trying to say   Let's get to it right away      Let's get the show on the road   Our love would be solid gold   Let's put the key to the door   Don't put it off anymore      'Til now it's only been dreams   I have lived for   Come one, let's do it   'cause I want to give more      [Chorus]      'Til now it's only been dreams   I have lived for   Come one, let's do it   'cause I want to give more      [Chorus: x2].""And if you like you can buy the ring""   She doesn't care about anything   Would you like to marry me?. The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test."
"Saturday sun came early one morning   In a sky so clear and blue   Saturday sun came without warning   So no-one knew what to do   Saturday sun brought people and faces   That didn't seem much in their day   But when I remembered those people and places   They were really too good in their way   In their way   In their way   Saturday sun won't come and see me today      Think about stories with reason and rhyme   Circling through your brain   And think about people in their season and time   Returning again and again   And again   And again   but Saturday sun has turned to Sunday's rain.Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plain   And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet   When the wind comes right behind the rain   Oklahoma ev'ry night my honey lamb and I   Sit alone and talk, and watch a hawk   Makin lazy circles in the sky      We know we belong to the land   And the land we belong to is grand   And when we say   Yeow!.than I ever did before going for   The dreams that I have in store in my mind (mind) and I know   That I'm makin it I gotta get mine and nobody's takin it away   (No!).He couldn't hear me screamin on the inside..Civilization crumblin' fast   End the world with a blast   People afraid walking the streets   Scums have their day   'Til they run into me   Are you ready?. I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without no friends just let in her mom"
"You only take what's there 'cause the rest doesn't matter..Pepper's lonely, Sgt..So shine, shine, shine,   Shine, shine, shine,   Shine, shine, shine..Still selling those pictures of the scriptures in the duomo   And Carolina, where are you, 'lina?.[Repeat x3]   I'd have to be a warrior   A slave I couldn't be   A soldier and a conqueror,   Fighting to be free.I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."
"When it's so easy for you to walk away      [Verse 3:]   So there I go, I'm leavin' you alone   What will you do, now all your fears   Came true   You had my heart, you had my soul   You had it all- didn't you   'Cause I'm sick of tryin' I'm goin' home   Back to Philly where I come from   And you can stay here and spend your   Whole life running, but baby it's   Time to move on   You didn't wanna work it out, no   You just wanted the easy route      [Chorus(out)]   You threw your hands up and walked away   When times got hard you always walked away   Well sorry baby but I'm leavin'   It was just too hard for you to talk to me   Now's my turn I'm gonna do the same   I'm gonna do the same   I'm gonna walk away   I'm gonna walk away   How does it feel baby?.Come on!.Don't want to be strangers..Feel the cold wind blowing-winter's coming on   Tis the season, so they say   If you need help believing 'cause your spirit ain't too strong   Hold my hand--we'll push that cloud away      Put a little holiday in your heart   It'll put a little shuffle in your step   Give you a song that you can sing   With a melody you can't forget   And if you want to join in a little harmony   To keep the world from tearin' apart   Well you know where to look   Yeah--you gotta put a little holiday in your heart      There's a man on the corner who doesn't have a name   People pass and turn their heads away   But to share a simple kindness would set your heart aflame   And you'll get more than you'll ever give away      Put a little holiday in your heart   It'll put a little shuffle in your step   Give you a song that you can sing   With a melody you can't forget   And if you want to join in a little harmony   To keep the world from tearin' apart   Well you know where to look   Yeah--you gotta put a little holiday in your heart      It starts with you, it starts with me   That ain't no stranger, he's family and it don't matter if we agree   It all comes down to love      Put a little holiday in your heart   It'll put a little shuffle in your step   Give you a song that you can sing   With a melody you can't forget   And if you want to join in a little harmony   To keep the world from tearin' apart   Well you know where to look   Yeah--you gotta put a little holiday in your heart.I believe in the freedom song   Doesn't matter what you do to me.

The reason why the author conclude the story with that saying was because it gave her a goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she @MONTH1 believe that the Hibiscus is good luck so she sets a goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories. In conclusion, certain things can trigger your memories, but its the good memories that make things in life something to wait and hope for."

One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself.

Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test."

"Grandpa wore his suit to dinner   Nearly every day   No particular reason   He just dressed that way      Brown necktie and a matching vest   And both his wingtip shoes   He built a closet on our back porch   And put a penny in a burned out fuse..Oh the weather outside is frightful   But the fire is so delightful   And since we've no place to go   Let It Snow!.Well, back in the past when I was treated so coldly,   My love life was a darn disgrace..Don't you know, baby?.Some people are very hard to shake awake   Some things are hard to define   Some lazy people've got haze on the brain   No motivation vacations holidays   You say you want to change the world upside down      Gotta go all the way   Start today   It's up to you to get it right   Gotta try gotta try      It's up to you to get things started   It's up to you no no not half hearted   Take each and every day as if it is your last   It's up to you you've things to do   It's up to you      Some have an attitude of fool all the rest   Take it all have a ball don't accept second best   So Hollywood but it's really anywhere   I've got a feeling it's something in the air   It's much the same across the worls all around   It won't change much without our feet on the ground      Gotta go all the way   Start today   It's up to you to get it right   Gotta try gotta try      It's up to you to get things started   It's up to you no no not half hearted   Take each and every day as if it is your last   It's up to you you've things to do   It's up to you      Hands off attitude   What's that gonna prove   If you pass the test   Don't look back   Settle for the best forget all the rest   Take it all have a ball   You deserve the best      It's up to you to get things started   It's up to you no no not half hearted   Take each and every day as if it is your last   It's up to you you've things to do   It's up to you      It's up to you to get things started   It's up to you no no not half hearted   Take each and every day as if it is your last   It's up to you you've things to do   It's up to you.I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, ”When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. "

She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom"

The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that’s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can’t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now”. Saeng didn’t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won’t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng’s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."

The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty."
"Gonna thank my lucky stars..Each day was so gay and so daring,   I loved every breathtaking minute,   For how could I know I was sharing   A kiss without a future in it..And we would go on as though nothing was wrong..Stand up!.Don't look at me,   You've got a girl at home,   And everybody knows that,   Everybody knows that,   Don't look at me,   You've got a girl at home,   And everybody knows that..I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way."

The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence."

It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things."

The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph."

It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story"

I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she’ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph."

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time."
"It's a dangerous world we live in   Crime is everywhere   There's always some sad story going down      You can read it in the paper   You can see it on the air   It's an evil epidemic going round      But nobody seems to notice   The saddest crime of all   Oh just how many times a day   Someone takes their love away   And the national statistics   Never put it in the chart   But every second someone breaks a heart      There's a woman out there somewhere   Who feels she lost her life   But her man just shot her world down   And it hurts      There's a guy who just got taken   And it cuts him like a knife   Some girl stole his heart and left him   Without a world      They don't call it a crime of passion   But it kills you just the same   It's murder when a true love dies   Right before your very eyes      And as soon as one is over   Another one will start   Every second someone breaks   Every second someone breaks a heart      If you've got someone who loves you   Be careful all the time   Do you know where your love is tonight   Cause there's always someone trying   To find the perfect crime   And you never know just when   They'll strike      So you better watch your woman   And you better watch your man   Cause no one's safe when love's at stake   Anybody's heart can break      And the next time that it happens   You're not the losing part   Every second someone breaks a heart   Every second someone breaks a heart   Every second someone breaks a heart.You know we talked about fighting-fighting everyday..Now every once in a while   There's a crack in my smile   Dark voices are talking to me   Dark voices tell me the way      It's supposed to be   They said ""Breakin' up""   They said ""It's hard to do""   But what they say      About breakin' up   Y'know it's just not true   Breakin' up, it's easy to do   Breakin' up, it's easy to do      Why if you know   Why did you have to go   And leave me on t he floor   About as sick as a dog      I'm feeding my face   Like a bleary-eyed hog   Why'd it have to stop   With so much good undone      Breakin' up, it's easy to do   Breakin' up, it's easy to do   Breakin' up, it's easy to do   Y'know I break up every time      I break up with you.I'm home again in my old narrow bed   Where I grew tall and my feet hung over the end   The low beam room with the window looking out   On the soft summer garden   Where the boys grew in the trees      Here I grew guilty   And no one was at fault   Frightened by the power in every innocent thought   And the silent understanding passing down   From daughter to daughter   Let the boys grow in the trees      Do you go to them or do you let them come to you   Do you stand in back afraid that you'll intrude   Deny yourself and hope someone will see   And live like a flower   While the boys grew in the trees      Last night I slept in sheets the colour of fire   Tonight I lie alone again and curse my own desires   Sentenced first to burn and then to freeze   And watch by the window   Where the boys grew in the trees.Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.. She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it."
"But when you think that I can't come up..You have no heart, you have no shame   You take true love, and give the blame   I guess that I, should not complain   I love you still, you win again..Then I grabbed that sucker by the throat   Until he called on me   Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three      And I don't want what Jay's got on his table   Or the box Carol Merrill points to on the floor   No, I'll hold out just as long as I am able   Until I can unlock that lucky door   Well, she's no big deal to most folks   But she's everything to me   Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three      Oh Monty, Monty, Monty, I am walking down your hall   God be, I lost my seat but I'm not a man to crawl   No I didn't get rich you son of a bitch   I'll be back just wait and see   Cause my whole world lies waiting behind door number three   Yes my whole world lies waiting behind door number three.Her passport shows a face   From another time and place   She looks nothing like that..I can't live that lie   Hate!. The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that’s how the girl feel. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did."
"I think I'll let the hook just try to explain   Stop that train, I want to' get off   Stop that train, I want to' get off.Isn't it such a nice feeling   The feeling you wished on a star?.I really want to know   It's the time of the season for loving      What's your name?.I'm gonna place my bet on us,   I know this love is heading in the same direction,   That's up..[how we do it?].The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle."
"It's irregular and it sure won't pay   but say naught 'til you got something to say   So I live for forty minutes a day   Can I have that?.You better hurry up and order one..Sympathy just doesn't mean   That much to me   Compassion's not   The fashion in my mind   And if you're looking for   A shoulder to cry on   Don't turn your head my way   'Cause I'd rather have   My music any day      You and I are   Masters of our destiny   We look for consolation all the time   Until we find out things are not   What they were meant to be, oh no   And if it doesn't suit our mood   We'll call it crime      Dedication's not an obligation   Or a figment of   Someone's imagination   It's the only way they say   To live from day to day   To make each passing way   A small sensation      Dreams are the possession of   The simple man   Reality the fantasy of youth   But living is a problem that   Is common to us all   With love the only   Common road to truth.G C G C      (G)Bouquet of flowers on her (C)kitchen window sill   (G)Listen to Bob Dylans new stuff (C)he'd just done in Jacksonville   (G)Lay down on the hillside and (C)look up at the sky   (D)We had it all you and I.

One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it."
"[Verse 1]   This is a black, black ski mask song,   So put all of your anger on..Why do they always hurt you..Don't they know it's the end of the world   It ended when I lost your love   I wake up in the morning and I wonder   Why everything is the same as it was   I can't understand, no, I can't understand   How life goes on the way it does   Why does my heart go on beating?.Make me see   What they said   Would come true in time?.And its just the same hard candy your remembering again..The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that."
"Ah!.Hold me this time..Called you yesterday   You didn't answer your phone   The main drag is knowing that   You probably weren't alone      So here I sit in my lonely room   Lookin' for my sunshine   But all I've got is two cigarettes   And this broken heart of mine      So let the rain come down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down, down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down, down      You've been gone seventeen days   Seventeen long nights   The main drag is knowing that   You're holding someone else tight      I want to to call you everyday   And beg you to be near me   But I know your head is underwater   I doubt that you could hear me      So let the rain come down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down, down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down, down      Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha   Seventeen days   Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha   Seventeen days      Called you yesterday   You didn't answer your phone   If you're the one who's always lonely   Then I'm the one who's always alone      So here I sit in my lonely room   Lookin' for my sunshine   All I've got is two cigarettes   And this broken heart of mine      Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down, down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down, down      Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down   Let the rain come down, down      Why don't you answer your phone?.Someone tell me who's controlling all these marionettes..Can you hear me?.The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she’ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant."
"You lock your letters in a box   And you've hidden the key   I go one better, I'm indebted   To a contact magazine   Tell me why don't we try   Not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?.We came to dance   Making moves from a passion play      The ties that bind us just slip away..Go diggin', uh check it      I bring the butter, huh   Make you wanna creep up on one another, huh   I'm mad sharp like a box cutter, huh   I got the fam' rollin' like brothers, huh   We in the mecca, Moey, rollie glistenin'   Raining on niggas so bad they think it's drizzlin'   Ground zero funk track it's mega   Doing wild damage to your arm, legga legga   Who's that?.I had the headache today   That's why you have a headache!.Hammerhead      No one can stop, our way to the top!. When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants."

The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story."
"In the midst of life we are in death etc!.It could have been helped, it might have been saved   With me and the helm, I could have found ways   To keep it afloat and find a new course   But I steered the ship right into the cliffs      The easy way out, a cowardly move   A short sighted plan made by a self-centered man   The crew stayed with the ship and bailed as one   They didn't know irreparable damage was done      They had so much pride and camaraderie   But that was all lost when tey spotted me   Rowing to shore with treasure on board   A cowardly plan mad by a self loathing man      Without regrets, without looking back   I coose to walk on the less beaten sociopath   With all the spoils of an island of one   I don't need dynasty, I don't need anyone      I knew the consequence when I plotted this trip   I'm not a man who'll go sown with the ship.Wars!.Too musch trouble better stay away   Grab your hat better get gone   But if you stay you've been warned   I'm a bullet and I'm headed      Straight for you heart (yeah)   Be careful what you start!.du du du du du   Its just another day..The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years."
"We'll get a smilin' nazi   And march him right on through   Rent a baby   Kiss a baby   Ladies in for tea      And here's a bunch of speeches   We'll toss 'em in for free      Sell us a president, agency man   Smiling Big Brother, stern father perhaps   Sell us a president, agency man   A gay smiling nothing we know never craps      We'll sell him in the movies   On the tube throughout the year   We'll sell him by the buckets   To the Okies drinking beer   We'll teach him how to walk and talk   We'll putty up his chin   We'll print his picture everywhere   Of course the schmuck will win      From the heart of old Death Valley   To the ruling of our land   A simple trick, you simple pigs   Just the way we planned.Alice, put your ashes in that ashtray, I swear woman,   You're gonna burn down the house..Strange   How a dreary world can suddenly change   To a world as bright as the evening star   Queer   What a difference when your vision is clear   And you see things as they really are      I used to be color-blind   But I met you and now I find   There's green in the grass   There's gold in the moon   There's blue in the skies      That semi-circle that was always hanging about   Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow   And you brought the colors out      Believe me it's really true   Till I met you I never knew   A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies      I never knew there were such lovely colors   And the big surprise   Is the red in your cheeks   The gold in your hair   The blue in your eyes.Begins with believing!.Everything you want, anything at all, everything you want..The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1."
"My heart is sad an' lonely   For you I sigh, for you dear only,   Why haven't you seen it?.Where is the love,   The love I need to set me free?.The guest for the grail to England   We sail, with our steel..Do you think of me?.Look over yonder   Well, he's talkin' to my baby   They found my peace pipe on her   Now they're draggin' her away   Lord knows we don't need a devil like him beatin' us around   Well, he's knockin' on my door   How my house is tumblin' down   Now don't you come no closer   The path is keepin' me bolder   Wait by my door baby   Unless you want to start another war   Look over yonder, hey   Look over yonder   Look over yonder   Look over yonder. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home."
"Doors are slamming shut   Limit your imagination, keep you where they must   Do you feel what I feel?.Would you stay?.It's Christmas Eve..Yeah I'm on your time,   Yeah you really give me quite a muse,   I say ""I wish that you could just get over yourself"", yeah yeah,   You say we're in this for the abuse..Went to my sisters room, ""Yo bitch wake up""   ""You stupid ass, dirty ass nasty ass slut."".The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph."
"""those were the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end""   Space monkey, space monkey   There's nothing to do   But it's better than living in a communist zoo   There'll be no one to greet you when you get back home   No hammer or sickle you'll be all on you own.Night of the iguana   The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet   Night of the iguana   Can you hear the castanets?.I miss the mountains,   I miss the highs and lows,   All the climbing, all the falling,   All the while the wild wind blows,   Stinging you with snow   And soaking you with rain   I miss the mountains,   I miss the pain..La,   I'm gonna buy myself (buy myself)   a house without windows (windows)   So I won't see you walking by (walking by)   And you'll never see me cry   For all the loving I had you treat me so bad and run away   So when you look inside (look inside)   You will never see me cry and cry   In my house without love      I'm gonna build myself (build myself)   a house without windows (windows)   So I can hide the pan (hide the pain)   And you'll never see me cry again   So when you're passing my way   Each time of the day ,you'll feel the love in you   And you can't look inside   So you'll never see my cry and cry   In my house without you      For all the loving I had , you treat me so bad and run away   So when you look inside ( look inside)   You will never see me cry and cry in my house without love.Not for just an hour,   Not for just a day,   Not for just a year,   But always..The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself."
"You took the love I offered   I tried the life that you lead   The truth was told and forgiven   You sold the strength that I need      Now I can see that all you wanted   Was someone you could hold a mirror to   This mirror shattered into pieces   You didn't want to really make things true      And the blame that you offered   Is something I didn't need   When the truth beads were counted   Is it you that I freed      And I can say that it's all over   And I can say that I don't want it too   I found that when I'm in your presence   That I could reach the highest side of you      And you can say it's all over baby   And you can say it's all over now      One more chance is what I stopped saying   A colder place to lay my head   Now it's over and truth is bragging   An empty heart and a single bed      And I can say it's all over   Well you can say that you don't want it too   I found that now I've lost your presence   Love doesn't always let you see right through      And you can say it's all over baby   And you can say it's all over now   And you can say it's all over baby   And you can say it's all over now.Look into my eyes and see   Everything you mean to me   Oh, lady do you believe   How can I express the way   I dream about you night and day   But I didn't prepare a speech      La da da da da da   La da da da da da   Speechless   See, I don't know what to say to you, but   La da da da da da (La da da)   La da da da da da (La da da)   Speechless   Here's a tender melody describin' love      Love   Love, ooh      Turnin' pages, tryin' to find (Tryin' to find)   Secret ways to make you mine (Make you mine, all mine)   Lady of desire   And every time I try to speak   Your presence just takes over me   Still I'm not prepared to speak, so lady      La da da da da da (La da da)   La da da da da da (Oh... oh... )   Speechless   Don't know what to say to you, but   La da da da da da (La da da da la da da da)   La da da da da da (La da da la da da)   Here's a tender melody describin' love (Love)   Love (La da la da lda da)   Yeah      Love (Love)   Love (La da da la da da la da da)      Just like ice cream   You're such a treat   I'm like a speaker without a speech      La da da da da da (I don't know what to say)   La da da da da da (I don't know what to do)   But sing ""La da da"" to you, girl   La da da da da da (La da da da da)   La da da da da da (La da da da da)   I'm speechless, baby, speechless, baby   Whoa... oh... ho...

The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself."
"Half moon, night time sky,   Seven stars, Heaven's eyes,   Seven songs on seven seas   Just to bring all your sweet love home to me..You think you are a star   Try'n' to run the town   Always try'n' to put us down      Well, you think that you're right   You think you're out of sight   Tell me something, mister   Why'd you have to make us so uptight?...And check out the walls...

The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesn’t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother"
"If you ready to ride, c'mon, get in my ride and let's slide   I got the whole world waitin' on me!.So this is why, I'm looking for a guy like you..Oooh   I see my future when I look in your eyes   It took your love to make my heart come alive   'Cause I lived my life believin' all love is blind   But everything about you is tellin' me this time      It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind   Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever      Oooh   It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind   Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever      Yeah.Just take a walk down lonely street   To Heartbreak Hotel..Payin' for being a fool like that..The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph."
"[Drake:]   It's Southern Smoke Boy!.Anger twisted your life into pain      I wish I could take control..Whores   Come on dearie, why all the fuss?.I was here once, and seen a lot!.Alive!.I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don’t even know what she  failed  so I didn’t  like it."
"I'm a fool and I can tell ..Appendages flailing, you're running at me   Ferocious, tenaciously clawing at me   The devious gelatin holding me fast   Miraculous now you let me move past   Over the wall rushing rivers of sleaze   The tips of stalactites incising my knees   A slipper, a sand dollar day at the shore   Nice evening at home that I dread even more   Would you please   Make clear to me   I'm peering out through your opacity   Though you rehearse   Tomorrow's verse   Forgive me if I don't sing in your key   Look back on those days when my life was a haze   The gelatin lay on a truncated sleigh   Copernicus drank from a vessel that stank   The free masons crank to the overflow tank      Bane of the weasel, for biding his fun   Jump on the turnstile and watch me go 'round   Swim with the cactus and float with the stone   I try to convey what you strive to condone      Da da, da da, da-da, da da doo   Da da, da da, da-da, da da doo   Da da, da da, da-da, da da da-da da da da da do      Would you please   Make clear to me   I'm peering out through your opacity   Though you rehearse   Tomorrow's verse   Forgive me if I don't sing in your key      Would you please (In all that dust and stone)   Make clear to me (And when you see me)   Why nothing is the first thing that I see   ?.(Right now)   I'm bout to show you how it's done, you can   (Shut down)   Yo, my Uzi weights a ton, you can   (Beat down)   And you can pump it in your system till it   (Blow out)   Whatever dog, no doubt, I'm bout to   (Smack up)   Anybody who front like he   (Hardcore)   Don't he know I stay raw?.Who could've known that endless road would ever have come this far?.Nightmare, the persecution   A child's dream of death.. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending."
"Oh Yeah   Roxy Music   Brian Ferry      Some expression in your eyes   Overtook me by surprise   Where was I how was I to know'   How can we drive to a movie show   When the music is here in my car   There's a band playing on the radio   With a rhythm of rhyming guitars   They playing Oh Yeah on the radio   And so came to be our song      And so on through all summer long   Day and night drifting into love   Driving you home from a movie show   So in tune to the sounds in my car   There's a band playing on the radio   With a rhythm of rhyming guitars   They playing Oh Yeah on the radio   It's some time since we said goodbye   And now we lead our separate lives   But where am I where can I go'      Driving alone to a movie show   So I turn to the sounds in my car   There's a band playing on the radio   With a rhythm of rhyming guitars   There's a band playing on the radio   And it's drowning the sound of my tears   They're playing Oh Yeah on the radio.I wanted so much for you to believe it me..I was raised the northern way   And my father had a northern name,   I did my crying out in the pouring rain..The morning sings the golden melody,   The evening brings the moonlight symphony,   For all the world is wrapped in harmony   Down on melody farm..Some one save me tonight   Some one save me tonight      I'm a litttle crazy drunk tonight   On the dance floor with my gurlz   Tonight night night night   Come on suzanne lets go I got you gaga   Come on I see you again see you again from that night   I got out of hand please excuse me I was only tipsy I got my phone from you last night night night night...

The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think."
"Hoping someone will tell me how wrong I am,   Howard..The old soft shoe..I'm doing you a favor   As I'm taking all your money   I guess I should feel sorry   But I don't even trust me   There's bad news creeping up   And you feel a sudden chill   How do you do?.Howl at the moon..""'Shows with love and affection',   Like mama used to say.. Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better."
"Denying the lying   A million children fighting   For lives in strife   For hope beyond the horizon      A dead world   A dark path   Not even crossroads to choose from   All the blood red   Carpets before me   Behold this fair creation of God!.He joins the lovers in his heavy machine   It's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard..And what was in those ships all three   On Christmas Day in the morning?.I took some food for thought,   It might be poisoned..After car after bus after car after truck   After this my lungs will be so fucked up   I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz   Sealed away from my scents   I'd have the music high going ninety five   Too much too much too much too much      Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear   Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear   Don't you care?.

"I lived out more than a little,   Give my insides out til there's nothing left to see   Stepped down, left in the middle of the mess you made   The mess I used to be   So give me love   Give me every little bit of your broken heart   My heart skips a beat   So give me love, give me love love love   My insides out, there's nothing left to see      Now I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own   I needed to find, now I needed to find out on my own      From my head all the way to my feet   Strange is what I've become   Would you ask for a little more of me   Why can't I find it?.Just a little bit more..But, I'm changing fast   You'll put it all in my past   No more running around   Feel like I'm fit to be tied down..And a church is burning   The flames rise higher   Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky   Like hands that are praying the fire is saying,   ""You can burn down my churches but I shall be free."".(before too long)   When I was young I thought that everything was good,   But how it slowly fades away.... The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test."
"Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest, all I need now is the girl   Got my striped tie, got my hopes high   Got the time and the place and I got the rhythm,   Now all I need's the girl to go with 'em      If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl   And if she'll say ""My, darling, I'm yours""   I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed   All I really need is the girl      Got my tweed pressed, I got my best vest, all I need now is the girl   Got my striped tie, got my hopes 'way up high   I got the time and the place and the rhythm   All I need's the girl to go with 'em      Mm, if she'll just appear we'll take this, this great big town for a whirl   And if, if she'll say ""My, darlin', I'm yours""   I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed   All I real, really need is the girl.It's like a dream, no end and no beginning..Welcome boys   Welcome to the real world   I could almost be sorry   But I could be wrong   I know you   I know what you've been doing   I know where you live   And I know where you are   You know me   I'm the smiling assassin   You know I won't forgive   And you know I won't forget.I'm broke..Memories that last the years   Call me sentimental. the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test."
"Sending out at an s.o.s..And I don't want,   I, I don't want,   I don't want the night to end..I've been often told our world's growing old   And that friends are harder to find   Do tell me more about yourself   We could share a thought or two   Now who would mind?.Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,   Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you..You think you got tattoos   Your grandkids are gonna like?.I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph."
"Monday has come around again   I'm in the same old place   With the same old faces always watching me   Who knows how long I'll have to stay   Could be a hundred years   Of sweat and tears   At the rate that I get paid      Sometimes I slowly drift away   From all the dull routine   That's with me every day   A fantasy will come to me   Diamonds are what I really need   Think I'll rob a store, escape the law   And live in Italy      Lately my luck has been so bad   You know the roulette wheel's   A crooked deal   I'm losing all I had      Soon be like a man that's on the run   And live from day to day   Never needing anyone   Play hide and seek   Throughout the week      My life is full of romance      Guess I'll always have to be   Living in a fantasy   That's the way it's got to be   From now on   You think I'm crazy I can see   It's you for you, and me for me   Living in a fantasy   From now on.Tell me I'm anything but fine..I think it's gonna rain   When I die   Was it something I said, held against me?.Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya..One of them days?. The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test."
"I wonder, I wonder   I wonder, does she call my name   I cried   Don't leave me here alone   I cried   Don't leave me here alone   I cried   Don't leave me, don't leave me   Don't leave me, don't leave me   I cried   Don't leave me, don't leave me here   I'm quite alone.Put your head on my shoulder   Whisper in my ear baby   Put your head on my shoulder..And if life a bitch suck my dick huh?.Music must be a lady   The way it makes me love to me   Me, you, music, music,   I'm so amazed by your choice of melodies that you used on me   Lady music, when we make love it's like we're making love with the same key   Music must a lady cause of the way you sing your melody, woman, oh,   Walk on by your sexual energy   Miss conduct all up orchestration means how to please you   In this room music I do for you      I hear a drum roll as we   When you grace my stage I can't find the words to say   Music must be, must be a woman   You're my anthem, you're the reason why I dance   Music, missis music, miss music, I wanna make your body sing some come joy and happiness      Write your words in my bed   Miss music, said I'll never fall in love, never ever fall in love   Now here I am in love, so so in love with you   Miss music, this love making is so unique,   Come on let it break out over me like a quiet, beat   Music, said I celebrate you and I honored you and I salute you   And I sing my heart out to you,   Music, cause you deserve it and I would like to do some things to you   Music, so get ready, miss music, get ready darling,   Cause I'm about to add, I'm a need to your life   Love making do it, just to be precise baby   Music, hello sweet soprano, miss music   I want you to meet mister tenor   And I love your music, as a matter of fact I'm quite a big fan   Music, missis music, missed you, missis music, music.I'm asking you to be watchtower   tower, tower, tower   to be watchtower   tower, tower, tower         Some men just like the journey   don't care if it's incomplete   Some women like a long trip   Some women short 'n' sweet   But if we lift each other up   Let's make it 10,000 feet   feet, feet, feet   10,000 feet   feet, feet, feet         The reason I'm still down here   and I've never taken off   Is I never had the courage   To rummage through love's loft   loft, loft, loft   The highest loft   loft, loft, loft         Cos when we're finally up there   and the engines have been stopped   the landing won't be fatal   if love's parachute's been dropped   dropped, dropped, dropped   love's been dropped   dropped, dropped, dropp.The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because she failed the test. Saeng failed to fine the fine–toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding."
"And so we say   We ain't diggin' no graves   We're diggin' a foundation   For a future to be made      Now I know, time can march   With it's chargin' feet   Now I know, words are only cheap   It's gonna be a burn out   All around this town   The South is up   But the North is down      There's gonna be a killin'   Of a woman and a man   Trying to feed that child   Without a coin in their hand      It's gonna be a burn out!.But on and on   from the moment I wake   to the moment I sleep   I'll be there by your side   Just you try and stop me   I'll be waiting in line   Just to see if you care, if you care   Oh, did you want me to change   Well I'd change for good   and I want you to know   That you'll always get your way   And I wanted to say.........

What the @CAPS1 “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It means she’ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she’s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it."
"I used to wonder why   When I was walking by   They talked about me   What could it be   They tried to break me   Never could make me      Out in the streets   Takin' all the heat   Dancin' in the sheets, oh yeah      All those streaks in my hair   People point at me and stare   If they ask me I'll say, ""yeah!"".I know the city gettin' ready for me   I know the city gettin' ready      Are you?.Oh I can still remember   Jenny Hernando   She was my little lovely one   When I was seventeen..Come on baby, what's on your mind   You're stumbling in the darkness   Like you're running blind   Hey can't you see we've been fooling around   This same old graveyard   on the same playground   Be my late night movie star   By my nature I can tell who you are   Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes   There's no innocence   In your bedroom eyes   Baby Baby   Got no self-defense   For your bedroom eyes   Over and over then we do it again   Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when   Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around   Is there any way to stop this merry go round   Be my late night movie star   By my nature I can tell who you are   Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes   There's no innocence   In your bedroom eyes   Baby Baby   Got no self-defense   For your bedroom eyes   Over and over then we do it again   Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when   Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around   Is there any way to stop this merry go round.got no patience   I'm actin like I'm racin'   Before I become a rasin'   Strippers hotter then cajun   My ??.The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality."
"Lay beside me   Tell me what they've done   Speak the words I want to hear   To make my demons run   The door is locked now   But it's open if you're true   If you can understand the me   Then I can understand the you   Lay beside me   Under wicked sky   The black of day   Dark of night   We share this paralyze   The door cracks open   But there's no sun shining through   Black heart scarring darker still   But there's no sun shining through   No, there's no sun shining through   No, there's no sun shining   What I've felt   What I've known   Turn the pages   Turn the stone   Behind the door   Should I open it for you?.They've gone about as fur as they can go      Yes sir!.Take, up in space..I'm fortune tellin', you're not buying what I'm sellin', if that look is a cry... then call me a villain....Does it take some train whistle blowing   To forget me?. I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  "
"Does his life mean more than it did before..Take back, take back, take..Sunny one so true, I love you..This is for all the lonely people   Thinking that life has passed them by   Don't give up   Until you drink from the silver cup   And ride that highway in the sky      This is for all the single people   Thinking that life has left them dry   Don't give up   Until you drink from the silver cup   You never know until you try      Well, I'm on my way   Yes, I'm back to stay   Well, I'm on my way back home      This is for all the lonely people   Thinking that life has passed them by   Don't give up   Until you drink from the silver cup   She'll never take you down or   Never give you up   You'll never know until you try.Only if you stay only if you stay baby.. Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story."
"Don't you?.Ya like it?.Take a bottle (take a bottle)   Shake it up (shake it up)   Break the bubble (break it up)   Break it up (break it up)   Pour some sugar on me   Ooh in the name of love   Pour some sugar on me   C'mon fire me up   Pour your sugar on me   Ooh I can't get enough   Pour some sugar on me   Ooh in the name of love   Pour some sugar on me   Get it, come get it   Pour your sugar on me, oh   Pour some sugar on me yeah, sugar me.!.Where do we go from here now that all other children are growin' up   And how do we spend our lives if there's no-one to lend us a hand      I don't want to live here no more,   I don't want to stay   Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life,   Quietly fading away      Games people play,   You take take it or you leave it   Things that they say,   Are not right   If I promise you the Moon and the Stars,   Would you believe it   Games people play in the middle of the night      Where do we go from here now that all of the children have grown up   And how do we spend our time knowin' nobody gives us a damn      I don't want to live here no more,   I don't want to stay   Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life,   Quietly fading away      Games people play,   You take take it or you leave it   Things that they say,   Just don't make it right   If I'm tellin' you the truth right now,   Do you believe it   Games people play in the middle of the night      Games people play,   You take take it or you leave it   Things that they say,   Are not right   If I promise you the Moon and the Stars,   Would you believe it   Games people play in the middle of the night      Games people play,   You take take it or you leave it   Things that they say,   Just don't make it right   If I'm tellin' you the truth right now,   Do you believe it   Games people play in the middle of the night. The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place."
I know where I'm goin'   Don't you want to come too?.Now that you're knowing   Pleasure starts flowing..I like together   But all I got was a switchblade..I was born a rambling man   An' I never got the chance   To settle down an' get a hold on love   Takin' air an' movin' around   Is all I can see that I'm doin'   An' it is bringin' me down   Drivin' on a highway going nowhere   Desolation destination   Guess I'll find it somewhere   I know if there's trouble   I ain't takin' the blame   That's why I keep movin'   So nobody knows my name      Born a loser   I'm beyond the law   Women behind me   Never can find me   They can never get together   What I've been here for   'cause I'm a drifter      Rollin' on   Ain't wastin' my time no more.Do you dream about staging a coup?. She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it.
"He was Lawless by name, Lawless by nature,   He was trouble right from the start..[Verse:]   From my head to my toes   I can hardly believe the things that I read are not   That it's hard, fly it in your plane and drive it in your car   You're a superstar, yes you are,   Signing autographs, making people laugh   You'll go far, clever boy,   Girls just wanna be with you, lawyers wanna deal with you..I'll be all in clover,   And when they look you over   I'll be the proudest fella   In the Easter parade!.You say your life's   Like riding on a fast train   It's easy to see far away   But right up close   It's just a blurry haze   Flyin' by from day to day..Brought to this world to wither again   Naive about the ways of life is what they say   Millions live millions die, more are yet to come   Living skeletons   Where they come from      Born dead into this world   To starve and rot in agony   Born dead into this world   It's their choice, why can't you see      Life of misery, soon a corpse you be   As bones show through, nothing you can do      Relief does not exist   When you are born to die      Disease spreads fast across their dying world   Many cemeteries they will have to build   As process goes on for many years to come   A human waste land created when they are done      Born dead into this world   To starve and rot in agony   Born dead into this world   It's their choice, why can't you see.The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again."
"I see your smiling face, by the open door   There's the morning light   Shining in your hair, and in your eyes      And just a little way behind that smile of yours   I see another one, oh so far away   If only for one second, I could hold you close to me   When the Master calls for me again   There's nothing I can say, or I can do      Goodbye, my love   Time has come to say farewell   I hear the call again   Goodbye to the world   I've shouted for so long   Oh there's so much my love, that I can never say      And in a little while, in a little while   There's nothing left to see      As the years go by and I have not returned   And the night has come, falling all around   Ooh if you count the stars you'll know   How many have gone out   And when the Master calls for me again   There's nothing that I can say   Or I can do      Stand in the sun   Shut your eyes and feel the world   It's changing every day   Goodbye my love   Each day will seem so long   Ooh there's so much I feel, that I can never say      I can't see you   I can't feel you anymore   I've just a memory of that open door.What you're sayin' it never really crossed my mind   I hear playin' and everybody's keepin' time   I'm recallin' that girl I met in London town   She was strange, young and tender and narrowed all my choices down      [Chorus]   We ran away into the night hypnotized   You carved your name right next to mine, English Eyes      I was tryin' to read her lips and knew the time was drawing near   I forgot what she said but I remember how she whispered in my ear   I can hear laughter coming from the places we once knew   There were stories from a stranger out of nowhere but they seemed so true      [Chorus]   English eyes,   English eyes      Where are you   When I call out your name?.And, put it in my heart where it's supposed to be..It tastes like someone jizzed   All over it."".For each perfect gift of thine,   To our race so freely given,   Graces human and divine,   Flowers of earth and buds of heaven,   Lord of all, to thee we raise   This our grateful hymn of praise..The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means."
"You're my joy, happiness that you bring   Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling   You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time   Studied all the words to the rhyme   You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon   There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight      [Mary J. Blige]   But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care   Be a man, no matter what the circumstances   Ahhhow!...Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day, in his life   And Momma, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that   Papa had three outside children   And another wife, and that ain't right   Heard some talk Papa doing some store front preachin'   Talking about saving souls and all the time leechin'   Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord   Momma just hung her head and said      Papa was a rolling stone, (my son)   Where ever he laid his hat was his home   And when he died, all he left us was alone   Hey Papa was a rolling stone, (dad gumma it)   Where ever he laid his hat was his home   And when he died, all he left us was alone      Hey Momma,   I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades   Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave   Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal   To pay his bills   Hey Momma,   Folks say Papa never was much on thinking   Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking   Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth   Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son      Papa was a rolling stone, (well, well, well, well)   Where ever he laid his hat was his home   And when he died, all he left us was alone (lone, lone, lone, alone)   Papa was a rolling stone,   Where ever he laid his hat was his home   And when he died, all he left us was alone      (I said) Papa was a rolling stone, (yes he was my son)   Where ever he laid his hat was his home   And when he died, all he left us was alone   (My daddy was, yes he was, yeah he was)   (Papa was a rolling stone,   Where ever he laid his hat was his home).Who would guess you were the chosen one?.Oh, oh, oh oh oh helpess, so Helpless.. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up “…then I will take that teat again” which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph."
"The day that I left Lucy   A tear fell from her eye   Now I don't have nobody   And I was such a fool   On the day that I left Lucy   The day that I left Lucy   She cried, then said goodbye      Now it's done and it's over and I am all alone   On the day that I left Lucy   Now I don't have anymore songs to sing   'Cause you're everything, everything to me   I don't realize I felt this way until the day      Today I'm missing Lucy   And you say that she's okay   I hope she is   Now I don't have nobody and no one will ever replace      My Lucy   I love Lucy   Lucy   On the day that I left Lucy, my Lucy.(Mississippi downtown.).Sadly it's too late for sorry..When I'm gone from here   Will you wait for me   When I'm far from here   Will you pray for me   Would you care for me   If I needed hospitality   Would you cry for me   If I were lying in bed   Lying in bed dying      Would you walk for me   If I had no feet   Would you talk for me   If I had no speech   Would you see for me   If I had no sight   Would you hear for me   If I could't hear   I couldn't hear anymore   She says      Chorus:   I will be your bride   Be there truly by your side   I will be your bride   I will give my fullest heart      Now that I must go   I know you'll wait for me   They're taking me to war   To cease the enemy   Heavens strength will grow   Within you and me   In crucial times it'll show   If we're bond as one   To make a big family      Chorus      There's no limits life is long   There's no limits life goes on   There's no limits life is long   There's no boundaries   'cause life goes on      When I'm gone from here   Will you wait for me   When I'm far from here   Will you pray for me   Would you care for me   If I needed hospitality   Would you cry for me   If I were lying in bed   Lying in bed dying   She says      Chorus   There's no limits life is long   There's no boundaries   'cause life goes on.Every day in every way they're here to stay   They're really really neat   They're really sweet   They're real petite   I like girls!.The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her."
"Everything's gonna be all right!.And one of these, one of these days   I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away   One of these days      One of these days (one of these days)   One of these days (some how, some way)   One of these days (one of these days).Yep   Cell phone?.Excuse me?.Ghostbusters   If ya all alone   Pick up the phone   And call   Ghostbusters      I ain't afraid of no ghosts   I here it likes the ghost   I ain't afraid of no ghost   Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah   Who ya gonna call?. The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience."
"When the darkness takes me over   Face down, emptier than zero   Invisible you come to me   Quietly      Stay beside me   Whisper to me ""Here I am""   And the loneliness fades      Some people think I'm somethin'   Well you gave me that, I know   But I always feel like nothing   When I'm in the dark alone      You provide the soul, the spark that drives me on   Makes me something more than flesh and bone      At times like these   Any fool can see   Any fool can see   Your love inside me      All these years   Truth In front of my eyes   While I denied   What my heart knows was right      At times like these   Any fool can see   Any fool can see   Your love inside me      I want to be someone   I want to be someone   I want to be someone   Who someone would want to be   Someone would want to be      Wendy   Darling   In the kitchen   With your dreams      Will you fly   again   Take to the sky   again      Undo the hooks   Once and for all   Banish the tic tic tic tok tok tok   Again      Will you be   Yourself for me   Cause I can take it   I can stand   Anything      When you're with me   I can stand it   I can stand      But when you're gone   I never land   In Neverland      Want to be someone someone would want to be   someone someone would want to be   someone someone would want to be   someone someone someone someone      Any fool   Any fool can see   Any fool can see   Your love   Inside me.Let it go!.There's a lot that's going on   In my pocket full of tricks   Got some secrets up my sleeve   If you know just what I mean   Got places you've never been   Take you out of your skin      Well, I'm trouble, trouble, trouble, baby   Always knocking at my door   Yes, I'm a whole lot of lot of trouble, baby   Oh, since the day that I was born      Yeah, oh yeah.I don't want to know you..Save your soul, it's all a test,   Save your soul, it's for the best..The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do."
"You could be his daughter   Look what he's bought ya   But the money won't change ya   Of that there's no danger   Now your life's gettin' darker   It's you that they're after   Fifteen minutes a martyr   Blame it on your father   That dress nearly fits ya   Girl what's possessed you   Can we please take your picture   You know they'll forget ya   Ooh yeah      It all seems so easy   But so are you   That's what I've heard them say      By all means necessary   You will get your way   By all means necessary   You will get your way   By all means necessary   You will get your way      You don't get your way   By giving it away      You don't get your way   By giving it away.Drift on a river   that flows through my arms..Even a rock will crumble,   If you strike it night and day..Mine is the face of fighter,   But my heart has just lost the fight..Feel the magic when I hold you   Cry sweet tears of joy, touch the sky      Now I need you more than ever.. She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder. "
"I see trees of green, red roses too   I see them bloom for me and you   And I think to myself what a wonderful world..My funny valentine   Sweet, comic valentine   You make me smile with my heart   Oooh, mmm   Your looks are laughable   Un-photographable   Yet, you're my favorite work of art   Is your figure less than Greek?.I bring you love and deeper understanding..Am I evil?.And think not you can direct the course of   Love itself directs the course of love   Believe not god is in your heart, child   But rather you're in the heart of god      So you see so far I'm all right   Pleasant and awkwardly polite   Watching carefully the comedy   The tick tock moments of the grid lock day      And why I'm singing   About the fact that I'm giving up everything   And giving back to the people that made me want to change   My evil, lazy ways   I'm gonna give you one more phrase to explain      See I believe in only one thing   I believe in good orderly D I are E C T I O N   I'll spell it again, roll it with abbreviation   Easy as a 1 2 3   Spell it backwards it's a D O G   'Cause it's a dog eat dog world   What a life girl, maybe you should make you my wife girl      And I believe in omni possibility   It's nothing more than good orderly direction   Nothing more than good orderly direction   Nothing more than good orderly direction   This is nothing more than good orderly direction   So what should you do when god moves through you?. I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn’t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year."

The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring."
"(Niggas!!)"".Love me tender, love me long, take me to your heart..Let's talk about, uh, talk about something else..With tears for two..And did you say that she loves you?. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test."
"Have mercy on a poor boy's heart   'Cause I got the key that can make your motor start   Can't you love me   Without messin' me around   You took everything I got then kick me when I'm down   Ooo, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level   I look into those eyes but all I see's the devil   I heard through the vine that you may not be mine   Don't lock me up   I can't pay the fine   Make up your mind before you make me lose mine   Your love's got me doin' time   Have mercy on a poor boy's soul   I've been down so long never thought I could feel so low   First you love me   Then you stab my back   Close the door, turn the key, all I can see is black   Ooo, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level   I look into those eyes but all I see's the devil   I heard through the vine that you may not be mine   Don't lock me up   I can't pay the fine   Make up your mind before you make me lose mine   Your love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   So what's a poor boy supposed to do   I've done everything I can, I've been so true   You got a mean streak   Like an alley cat   You sucked all the love from me like a vampire bat   Ooo, got this funny feeling that you ain't on the level   I look into those eyes but all I see's the devil   I heard through the vine that you may not be mine   Don't lock me up   I can't pay the fine   Make up your mind before you make me lose mine   Your love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time   Love's got me doin'   Love's got me doin' time.In blind faith would you believe?.Way back in Raleigh, North Carolina..Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay   No more skipping rope   Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown   Just you and me feeling the heat   Even when the sun goes down.A lowly manger shelters Him   This Holy Boy   God's angels sing above with joy   Allelujah, allelujah!.The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."
"Yeah!.When the morning comes, I'll be on my way..I will get back to you (will get back to you)      (Never get back, never gonna get back) Ah, ah, ah   (Never get back, never gonna get back) Number   (Never get back, never gonna get back) Ah, ah, ah   (Never get back, never gonna get back) Number      Never get back to you      (The number you have dialed has been changed).Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now   Tonight I'm in his arms but he just don't seem the same   I cheated and I'm guilty my heart can't stand this pain   I let passions fill my mind from my heart and conscience blind   I feel I'm mighty low and I pray he'll never know   He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now   [ steel - piano ]   It almost breaks my heart when he says that he loves me   I know that I'm not worthy and that's what troubles me   If he do what I had done could he still feel just the same   Or would he feel the way I do guilty and a shame   He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now   Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now.Steady rock easy   Rock stead easy   Steady rock easy   Rock stead easy   Steady rock easy   When first I heard rock steady   Thrilled me to the bone   When I talk about rocking steady   You need a baby for your own   Rock stead easy   Steady rock easy   Rock stead easy   Steady rock easy   Talk about the cha-cha   Talk about the mambo   When I talk about rocking steady   You better be ready   To rock stead easy      Steady rock easy   Rock stead easy   Steady rock easy   When first I heard rock steady   Thrilled me to the bone   When I talk about rocking steady   You need a baby for your own   Rock stead easy   Steady rock easy   Rock stead easy   Steady rock easy   Rock stead easy   Steady rock easy   You're doing good   Rock stead easy   Just like you should   Steady rock easy   You're looking fine.The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won’t spend so much time dreaming about her past. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life."
"It was Geoff, Geoff   I lost my buddy and I wept, wept   I come down from the meth   So I slept, slept   I had a good home but I left, left      Pantsed at the wind for a joke   I pranced right in with the dope   Glanced at her shin she said nope   Left, right, left      Nimrod Bodfish have you any wool   Get me another body bag, the body bag's full   My face was scorched, scorched   I miss my home I miss my porch, porch   Left, right, left      Can I go home in March?.What's the point in dying,   When the world thinks you're already dead?.Calling for revolution!.I knew quite suddenly   Do you sense how I feel?.Go head, go head   Go head, go head   Go head, go head   Go head, baby girl go head   Go head, go head   Go head, go head   Go head, go head   Go head      [Chorus: x2]   Shawty gotta ass on ha (on ha)   I'ma put my hands on ha (on ha)   I'ma spend a couple grand on ha (on ha)   I'ma pop a rubber band on ha (on ha)      I'm tryna figure which chick I'ma see today (see today)..In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way."
"I am man who reveals all he digs,   Should be more careful what I say..Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?.You were living your life just like a little girl   Spreading your wings in the middle of your little world   And in your mind, your tiny mind   You know you've fallen far behind   Now you're gonna burn      Fire!.[Chorus]      Sometimes I want to leave right now   Sometimes I want to cry out loud   I want to let it all hang out   But I don't want to let you down..come with me now on this island of love running away from all sivilization Open your eyes to a bright new dawn      Over all we have done good..Saeng  would  silently in spring she will take the that again in the good ending to this story it was as goods ended  because the story had listed   come  of  malance  ready and spring it and of the plant beautiful  time the spring the all as plant ending because spring in a near trying and for the take the test again of that time , to think it’s a goods ending because the ruler strong are  about   machines saeng and spring it  and  makes  is near paragraph . That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   "

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways."
"People in prayer for me   Everyone there for me   Sometimes I feel I should face this alone   My soul exposed   It calms me to know that I won't      Blood   Heal me   Fear   Change me   Belief will always save me   Blood   Swearing   Fear   Staring   Conviction made aware      Give up on misery   Turn your back on dissent   Leave their distrust behind   Wash your hands of regret      Blood   Heal me   Fear   Change me   Belief will always save me   Blood   Swearing   Fear   Staring   Conviction made aware      Learning from misery   Staring back at dissent   Leaving distrust behind   I'm inspired and content.It's time to make some money,   It's time to get rich quick..There's no one else in the whole outside world,   That matches to her in your soul..I'm alive again   Darkness far behind me   I'm invincible   Despair will never find me      I feel strong   I've got a new sense of elation   Boundless energy   Euphoria fixation      Still talk to just get by   Seems so meaningless to try   When all I want to do is cry   Who would ever know I felt so sad      'Cause even though I get so high   I know that I will never fly   And when I fall out of the sky   Who'll be standing by?...I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens"

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she’ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn’t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  "

So she can pass the test and be happy with the garden."

In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her."
"We got to get wrong   You move like a melody,   Everything they've got you've seen   That's why you keep holding on to me for so long..One day of your life is all I'm askin' girl,   Just give me one day of your life and let me share your world..Trying and lying   Defying denying   Crying and dying   Where is everybody?.I am the devil's advocate   A salesman, if you will..Liar!!!.In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome."
"But I am only a child of man   I am only a child of man   Just an innocent child of man      Don't look so surprised as my eyes   Shine and glow   It's the sunlight in the skies   That is making me so..bad bloody bloody mess   Shot all up in his chest   One sided duel, gun and a fool   What a way to go      Up in the city they called him boss jack   But down home he was a alley cat   Ah!.Now, baby if you're needin' me   The way that I been needin' you   Well, drop me a line   Sayin' honey you'll be mine   Write me in care of the blues      I hope that you've been missin' me   The way that I've been missin' you   I shouldn't have let you go   Because I miss you so   Write me in care of the blues      Give that postman your letter   And he'll know what to do   He'll bring your letter to me   And a plane will bring me to you      Now, baby if you're needin' me   The way that I been needin' you   Just drop me a line   Sayin' honey you'll be mine   Write me in care of the blues      (Repeat last two verses).What a joy I feel to think about forever   I'm a child of God   with blessings from Heaven   By your side, days always brighter   The Holy one   My Master   My Father      I will dwell in your courts   I will sing for you   you're my deepest love   Jesus   I love you      It's a love song I sing   It's an anthem from my heart   All praises to the King      I am not alone   Jesus   You're near me   Washed me clean with hands full of mercy   You're a resting place for all who are weary   A perfect place   and a new beginning.Go to outputs   Large scale integration   No source statements   Give me, give me flowchart   All died on call?.In the story “winter Hibiscus“ by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life but she failed. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again when the plant is in bloom."
"Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground..should've been over for me   No angel came..I can hear him in the morning, tellin' me what I got to do..Well don't believe in what you see..No one cares if you grow or if you shrink!.

She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, ….In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese return”, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that “In the spring"" she will take the test again."

The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus."

That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph."
"Baby, I'm-a want you   Baby, I'm-a need you   You the only one I care enough to hurt about   Maybe I'm-a crazy   But I just can't live without   Your lovin' and affection   Givin' me direction   Like a guiding light to help me through a darkest hour   Lately I'm a-prayin'   That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me      Used to be my life was just emotions passing by   Feeling all the while and never really knowing why      Lately I'm a-prayin'   That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me..So they go driving   Out to the river like lovers do   You smell out the summer   Baby, the summer just smells of you   One day, I'm gonna be a famous writer   Some book like love in the afternoon   It was all Lukas could say   Maybe one day, we could run away, run away      I thought we never last   I thought we never last      Now here comes Lukas   He done everything he wanna do   It was twenty years later   Come back to do what he promised to   He come back to make her happy   But these things don't always wait for you   And poor Lukas was late   That's when he got back, she'll be married today   Gone away      I thought we never last   I thought we never last      And Lukas would say   For a million lonely people   Another long gone   For a million hearts that opened   A million break   And the world's just a fallen angel in my way   I'm up in heaven, you can hear them say   Lookin' for Lukas but Lukas was always runnin' away.He chortled in his joy..Said, ""It's all right, take anything you want,   Anything you want, anything."".This was the first blues I ever learnt from   Bob Wells and the Texas Playboys   called the Milk Cow Blues      Yeah   Well I did woke up this mornin'   And I looks out my door-oor   Hey, I could tell my milkcow   I could tell by the way she lows   So if you see... my milk cow   Well drive, drive, help her back ho-ome   Cause I ain't had no milk and butter   Long since the cow's been go-one      Play your Harmonica Steve, yeah   Well I tried everythi-ing woman   Just to get alo-ong with you   And now I'm goin' to tell you   What I'm gonna do-oo   Well you know I'm gonna stop a-cryin'   I'a a-gonna leave you alo-one   If you don't think I'm leavin', honey   Count the days I'm gone   'Cause you're gonna nee-ee-ee-eed   Your lovin' daddy's help some day   And you will definitely be sorry   'Cause you treat your man the wrong way-ay-ay-ay      Play your fiddle Carl, yeah, ah-ah   Don't you fiddle it son, make it feel good, yeah      Play T.J. - from Chicago   Well, just treat your man right, woman   Day by day-ay   And get out your little prayer book   Get down on your knees and pray   'Cause you're gonna nee-ee-ee-eed   A lovin' daddy's help some day-ay   And you are goin' to be sorry   You just treat your old man the wrong way-ay.The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again"", because the author wants to convey that. Saeng isn’t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say’s, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.”"
"To get back in ....It's funny how the Earth rotates, man you never know what's   going to happen, ya know mean?.She went to Germany..I'm a bullet and I'm headed   Straight for you heart (yeah)   It's gonna leave a mark!.I'm gonna do all the things for you a girl wants a man to do   Oh, baby   (Oh, baby)   I'll sacrifice for you, I'll even do wrong for you   Oh, baby      Every minute, every hour   I'm gonna shower you with love and affection   Look out it's coming in your direction      And I'm, I'm gonna make you love me   Oh yes, I will, yes, I will   I'm gonna make you love me   Oh yes, I will, yes, I will      Look here, my love is strong, you see   I know you'll never get tired of me   Oh, baby   (Sure won't, oh, baby)      And I'm gonna use every trick in the book   I'll try my best to get you hooked   Hey, baby   (Take me I'm yours, hey, baby)      And every night, every day   I'm gonna say   I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you   Look out boy 'cause I'm gonna get you      I'm gonna make you love me   Ooh, yes I will, yes I will   And I'm gonna make you love me   Ooh, yes I will, you know I will      Every breathe I take   And each and every step I make   Brings me closer, baby   Closer to you      And with each beat of my heart   For every day we are apart   I'll hunger for every wasted hour      And every night and every day   I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you   Look out 'cause I'm gonna get you      And I'm gonna make   I'm gonna make you love me   (Yes, I will)   Oh, oh   (Yes, I will)   I'm gonna make you love me   Ooh, yes I will   Yes, I will      I'm gonna make you love me   Yes, I will   (Yes, I will)   Ooh, I'm gonna make you love me   Take that, yeah   Yes, I will. The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner."
"Sisters!.Death shines on the air of silence,   A ritual of endless time..I won't give up, I'm too much in love, and I want you to know that..Now there was a time when they used to say   Sisters are doin' it for themselves      Sisters are doin' it for themselves.We walk on every city street   We walk in lanes where branches meet   And stars send down their blessings from the blue..The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn’t like it because I didn’t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story."
"Lets drink to the hard working people,   Lets drink to the lowly of birth..Will I be lonely again?.Oh no, no, no, no, no, oh baby      [Chorus]   I'll make it right   Baby you know that I can make it right      Keep it on a cutie girl cause I'm really into you yeah   Tell me is there a way that i can spend some time with you   So much I want to know about you   Seems like I can't do without you   You really turn me on you got it goin' on   Anything you ask i'll do for you   So baby don't you see   You mean the world to me   Just one thing I have to know   Baby can I make it right      [Chorus]      As I'm looking into your eyes all I see is you lovely face   And there's nothin' I like more than to show you I adore   The simple things that you do to me with the sweet little   Things you say   Baby when I kiss your lips it really brightens up my day   Oh Oh Oh   Anything you ask I'll do for you   You mean the world to me   Just one thing I have to know   Baby can I make it right      [Chorus]      So baby don't you see you mean the world to me   If you just swing my way   I'll make it right   So tell me where do we go from here   Oh yeah      There's nowhere that we can go   But take it nice and slow   Baby enjoy the flow   Lots of pleasures I can give   I've got it waitin' here   So put away your fears      [Chorus].Oh!).You didn't phone when you said you would!. The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. "

In  the  spring, when  the  snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this hibiscus is budding, then  I  will take  that  tes t again. When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again."

"I'm gonna run to you   I'm gonna come to you   Do it now!.Just playin'   Just me, new phone, new hair, new era   I'm in the penthouse, baby   Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs   Held back, I had to grab crab legs   And then there were only but a few   Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view   What a dress, what a song   What a beautiful time   My folks downstairs still waitin' in line   They never been in these rooms   Never stayed with these folks   Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes   So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover   Forcin' a new smile, he tells me another   He said ""What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?"".With my thermal flask of tea..We were caught in a bubble, no one could burst..I wanted so much for you to believe it me..The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on."
"Seen the lights go out Broadway   I saw the Empire State laid low   And life went on beyond the Palisades   They all bought Cadillacs   And left there long ago      They held a concert out in Brooklyn   To watch the island bridges blow   They turned our power down   And drove us underground   But we went right on with the show      I've seen the lights go out on Broadway   I saw the ruins at my feet   You know we almost didn't notice it   We'd seen it all the time on 42nd Street      They burned the churches down in Harlem   Like in that Spanish civil war   The flames were everywhere   But no one really cared   It always burned up there before      I've seen the lights go out on Broadway   I saw the mighty skyline fall   The boats were waiting at the Battery   The union went on strike   They never sailed at all      They sent a carrier out from Norfolk   And picked the Yankees up for free   They said that Queens could stay   They blew the Bronx away   And sank Manhattan out at sea      You know those lights were bright on Broadway   That was so many years ago   Before we all lived here in Florida   Before the Mafia took over Mexico   There are not many who remember   They say a handful still survive   To tell the world about   The way the lights went out   And keep the memory alive.People slippin' in the rain   I watch them get up again   It makes me feel like I can too   Hey hey ya      Just when I get off the ground   Your back tryin' to put me down   Like some simpleton you can use   Hey      [Chorus]   Well It's the same old fucking story   With your two different sets of rules   The same old fucking story   One for me two for you   It's the same old fucking story   It's the same old fucking story all around yeah      Still some glory in my eyes   Much to everyone's surprise   After everything you put me through   Yeah well   Friends tell me you've been around   Big fish in a big ol' town   Gobble up all in one fair swoop yeah      [Chorus]      Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah   Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah   Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah   Still got my feet on tie to the beat yeah      Still some glory in my eyes   Much to everyone's surprise   After everything you put me through   Yeah well   Friends tell me you've been around   Big fish in a big ol' town   Gobble up all in one fair swoop yeah      [Chorus]      It's the same fucking story know damn well it's true   Same ol' same ol' same ol' same ol' same ol'      [Chorus].Got to let it --   Even though I fear   Too much of me might show,   I cant wait any longer for it,   I've had enough!.Little sleepy boy   Do you know what time it is?.Just you and me.. I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese."
"Haven't you taken enough from me?.Just like Moses and the Red Sea water   A little bit of faith and the ring I bought her   I hit my knees and she took my hand   And she lead my heart to the promised land..I'm remembering distant memories   Recalling other names..A lass called Milli Fawcett, founder of our cause,   Started the battle for our rights   Argued the government should change the laws,   Here is how she stated our plight      How come girls can't vote for rules that we have to obey?.As I lay me down   Heaven hear me now   I'm lost without a cause   After giving it my all      Winter storms have come   And darkened my sun   After all that I've been through   Who on earth can I turn to      I look to you   I look to you      After all my strength is gone   In you I can be strong      I look to you   I look to you      Yeah      And when melodies are gone   In you I hear a song      I look to you      After losing my breath   There's no more fighting left   Sinking to rise no more   Searching for that open door      And every road that I've taken   Led to my regret   And I don't know if I'm gonna make it   Nothing to do but lift my head      I look to you   I look to you      Yeah      And when all my strength is gone   In you I can be strong      I look to you   I look to you      Oh yeah      And when melodies are gone   In you I hear a song      I look to you      (my levies have broken, my walls have come)      Coming down on me      (crumbling down on me)      All the rain is falling      (the rain is falling, defeat is calling)      Set me free      (I need you to set me free)      Take me far away from the battle   I need you   Shine on me      I look to you   I look to you      After all my strength has gone   In you I can be strong      I look to you   I look to you      And when melodies are gone   In you I hear a song      I look to you      Yeah      I look to you   I look to you. At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work."
"My baby left me   She wouldn't tell a lie   Cause she said she would, she did   And she left me high and dry   My baby left me   Last night I heard her cry   She wouldn't tell me why   She just said bye-bye      I used to sing the blues   I thought I sang for real   Now I know the feel   And it hurts too much   My baby left me   She left me all alone   She's never coming home   And I want to die      My baby left me, my baby left me.I'm giving it all in a moment, for you..Now who else could I be?.But more than anything, yeah, more than anything      My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to,   Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small,   You never need to carry more than you can hold,   And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,   I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too,   Yeah, this, is my wish..May you stay forever young.. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she’s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She’s said  and does lots of fun things."
"Red wine, Konvict, Gaga (oh, yeah)      I've had a little bit too much - much oh oh woah!.I survived, everything   I have tried, everything (everything, everything)      All the walls begin to devolve away   Do your hands begin to shake shake shake shake shake?.Don't you take it too bad   If you're feelin' unlovin'   If you're feelin unfeelin'   If you're feelin' alone   Don't take it too bad      'Cause it ain't you to blame, babe   Lord, it's just some kind of game made   Out of all of this living   That we got left to do      And if you go searchin'   For rhyme or for reason   Then you won't have the time   That it take just for talkin'   About the places you've been, babe   About the places you've seen, babe   And how soft the time flies   Past your window at night      And we just can't have that, girl   'Cause it's a sad, lonesome, cold world   And a man need a woman just to stand by his side   And whisper sweet words in his ears about daydreams   And roses and playthings   And the sweetness of springtime   And the sound of the rain.I can ride home in the evening,   Staring at my hands,   Swearing by my sorrow   That a young girl   Ought to stand a better chance..Didn't even know what it was   He was looking for..I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful."

The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well."

I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time."

The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she she figurers when all the snow is melted she”ll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn’t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    "

It’s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is."
"They had us over for an outdoor New Year's party   Though it was 10 below, there was food and drink a-plenty   They got excited as we counted down with them   And when we kissed them, our lips stuck to their heads (ouch)   I was watching the news last night, when I saw something funny   Killer robots from somewhere decimated Montreal   I wondered, could it be my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus?.So be careful of that rascal, Keep away from The Jitterbug!.I found a place to call my den   And dreamt of the ferry and   The enormous man   Huge as were his children   Following around after him      I'm the islander   Woke up in the furtive spring   More capable of anything      I waited for more men to come   Hey docked their boats and cocked their guns   The time for truth and reconciliation's gone   But with my belly full I intended to get something done      I'm the islander   Woke up in the dead of spring   More hungry than anything   Islander.Cause we are the ones that wanna play,   Always wanna go,   But you never wanna stay,      And we are the ones that wanna choose,   Always wanna play,   But you never wanna lose..Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam   Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today   She is sorry to be delayed   But last evening down in Lover's Lane   She strayed, madam   Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today      When she woke up and found   That her dream of love was gone, madam   She ran to the man who had led her so far astray   And from under her velvet gown   She drew a gun and shot her love down, madam   Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today      When the mob came and got her   And dragged her from the jail, madam   They strung her upon the old willow across the way   And the moment before she died   She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam   Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today      Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today. I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back."
I'm the three day man   It's three days too long   Everything is in its right place but   Something is wrong   Time is on wheels   And my legs shake   I have to live with every decision   That you make      And that doesn't mean   That I'll be your slave   It doesn't mean you're here to stay   It doesn't mean we're friends for life   You know I want you   You know that I love you   But I'll never need you anyway   I'll never need you anyway      Sixes and sevens   Oh how it rains   Sleep is a station   Life is a train   People snatch instinctively for   Whatever crutch they need   But I promise not to abuse you   If you don't love me leave      And that means   That I'll be never your slave   It means that you're not here to stay   Means that we're not friends for life   You know how I want you   You know that I love you   But I'll never need you anyway   I'll never need you anyway   Never need you anyway      And that means   That I'll be never your slave   It means you're not here to stay   Means we're not friends for life   You know how I want you   You know that I love you      But I'll never need you anyway   I'll never need you anyway   I'll never need you anyway   Never need you anyway   I'll never need you anyway   I'll never need you!.[Repeat: x 2]   Why can't we still be friends?.Whoa!.Or as an indication   Change the dedication   From revolution to revelation?.I need it every night   Long live rock!. I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on
"Ha   You took my friends away, Yeah   You got them livin' for the grave   Now everything's been fine since you been gone   But you made my winter's feel so warm   I'm livin' for the soul that ain't been born      Yeah   See the suckers come down   It's alright   Mother Fucker   Come see      You played my soul for your fucking fool   Yeah down in the beat   You took my life and turned it around   But you made my winter's feel so warm   I'm livin' for the soul that ain't been born      Yeah   See the suckers come down   It's alright   Mother Fucker   Come see      Yeah   Your making me feel this way   I can't live everytime I'm in my grave   Yeah...Yeah   You got time burning the place on me, Yeah   Oh never alone, I've been fine, Yeah      Yeah   Your makin me feel this way   Yeah...Yeah   I guess I'm livin everytime you sit in my grave   You got the joke to break on me   So I'm never alone, I've been fine.He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan   And he said that he'd never, never do it again   And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)   He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan   And he swore that he'll never, never do it again   And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)   Poor old man   He had an accident with a three-bar fire   But that's ok   Because he wasn't very happy anyway   Poor woman   Strangled in her very own bed as she read   But that's ok   Because she was old and she would have died anyway   Don't blame   The sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan   Because he'll never, never, never, never, never, never do it again   (not until the next time)   Jury, you've heard every word   So before you decide   Would you look into those Mother-me eyes   I love you for you, my love, you my love   You my love, you my love   Jury, you've heard every word   But before you decide   Would you look into those Mother-me eyes   I love you for you my love, you my love   I love you just for you, my love   Don't blame   The sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan   Because he'll never, never do it again   And....Long distance runaround   Long time waiting to feel the sound   I still remember the dream there   I still remember the time you said goodbye   Did we really tell lies   Letting in the sunshine   Did we really count to one hundred      Cold summer listening   Hot colour melting the anger to stone   I still remember the dream there   I still remember the time you said goodbye   Did we really tell lies   Did we really count to one hundred      Long distance runaround   Long time waiting to feel the sound   I still remember the dream there   I still remember the time you said goodbye   Did we really tell lies   Letting in the sunshine   Did we really count to one hundred      Cold summer listening   Hot colour melting the anger to stone   I still remember the dream there   I still remember the time you said goodbye   Did we really tell lies   Did we really count to one hundred      Looking for the sunshine.'Cause I need to know   'Cause I need to know..I'm merely a man,   And I want nothing that you can't do.. The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now."

The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season."
"On the shores of gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water   Hiawatha old and grayin' listened to the older prophet listened to Lagu   And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways   From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies   Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha   ""I have seen"" he said, ""A water bigger than the big sea water   Broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it   Salty so that none would use it""   Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting   And he spoke to all the people   It's true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision   I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning   And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions   Bigger than a grove of pine trees, taller than the tallest tree tops   And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly   And it carried many people, strange and foreign were these people   And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered   Then said Hiawatha, ""I beheld a darker vision""   Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies   In our woodlands rang their axes, in our valleys smoked their cities   Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils   Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful   And the man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair   With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people   Farther westward, westward, westward then wild wild and wilder   Grew the west that once was ours.Tears of blood and sadness formed the wonderful silent lake   Swans and birds in water games will call Airin's name... her name!.He love your sexy body, he loves your dirty mind   He loves when you hold him when you grab him from behind   Oh baby, youre such a pretty thing   I cant wait to introduce you to the other members of my gang      You dont need no wax job, youre smooth enough for me   If you need you oil changed Ill do it for you free   Oh baby, the pleasure would be all mine   If you let me drive your pickup truck and park it where the   Sun dont shine      Every time he touches you his hair stands up on end   His legs begin to quiver and his mind begins to bend   Oh baby, youre such a tasty treat   But Im under doctors orders, Im afraid to overeat      He love your sense of humor, your disposition too   Theres absolutely nothing that he dont love about you   Oh baby, Im on my hands and knees   Life would be so simple if I only had you to please      Oh baby, turn around and say goodbye   You go to the airport now and Im going home to cry      He loves your...

V.   Get off my T. V.   O. J..Change of heart comes slow      It's not a hill it's a mountain   As you start out the climb   Do you believe me or are you doubting?.In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel."
"I watch you're fingers working overtime (Overtime),   I've got to thinking that they should be mine..Yeah   Come on!.I look this way   And you're not there   If you dont mind   My soul out there      Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa      [Chorus]      Mmm Papa, Mmm Papa, Mmm Papi   Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi, Mmm Papi   Mmm Luvi, Mmm Luvi, Mmm Papi      (You will always be there for me)   (You will always be there for me)      You love it when I'm freakin' out   Things get rough and there's no doubt   You love it when I'm freakin' out   Things get rough and there's no doubt      [Chorus]      Now see!.Why you acting like that?.Lets dance, come on please, just once for me   I never get to do anything like this   You're such a drag, you know that?. The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blosomed the leaves had come out and then the pollin had found the right kind of trees . At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again."

I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.The author could of wanted to show more details in the story."
"(Mike Stoller, Jerry Leiber)      ""I remember when I was a very little girl, our house caught on fire..Yes let them go to mars..I'm the one who plays piano..Was it the day in north Georgia you were   Trying to take her back..On a lover's leap with a freeway view   Sittin' on my hood   Thinkin' bout you   Going over in my mind   Every kiss and every fight   Yeah the fool on the hill   Is leading down another night      There were days so hard   I thought I had to go   I'd get in my car   And just follow the road   But this is my home   And it's who I am   And I know I'd stay   If I could make this old town new again      Color other than blue again   I'd have something to do again   Instead of thinking about you again   But the people I know   The places I go   Remind me of you   Oh, won't somebody come around   And make this old town new      There were nights so long   I thought the sun burned out   And there were girls so wrong   I don't want to talk about   I was burning up the night   Yeah, in an alcohol flame   Lightin' up my way   Trying to make this old town new again      Color other than blue again   I'd have something to do again   Instead of thinkin' about you again   But the people I know   The places I go   Remind me of you   Won't somebody come around   And make this old town new      But the people I know and   The places I go   Remind me of you      Love goes wrong but life goes on   And I know what I gotta do   I'm just hangin' around   Tryin' to make this old town new.I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS. THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY."

The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again.

I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”"
"Embodied in faint vapor..Do I measure up to what you want?.Well who are you what do you know   And I guess it only goes to show   Don't think you're ready for the fall   Do you think you really wanta play   Cause we do this every fucking day   And we're gonna lay down the law   You're outdrawn   ...Let's go outside, we'll crucify   ...But you're not there   You don't wanna cross the line boy   It will you your genocide   Your genocide   Do you think you really wanna throw   Cause you know UL is five and zero   Toe to toe and that shit is for real   You better pray to God up in the sky   Tuck your tail between your legs and hide   Get ready 'cause here comes the drill   And we got skill   You're standing there   Like we're gonna be all scared   Come now   And I don't really wanna brag   But my whole city's got my back   And we're all ready to attack.Come stare al ristorante   Se non hai niente da dire non dire niente   Una di rosso e mezza naturale cosi   Per continuare quel discorso in generale   Come fanno le mani a resistere ancora   E a non stringerti fino a morire   Come fanno le parole a seguirsi intrecciarsi fino a sparire   Come fa la tua voce a cantare la pioggia che cade   Il vento il sereno   La tua voce a toccare a sfumare nei colori dell'arcobaleno   La tua voce a toccare a sfumare nella luce   Dell'arcobaleno   Ma tutto questo?.I haven't seen all there is to see   But I've seen quite a bit   Some things I'll always remember   Some things I wish that I could forget   I haven't quite been around the world   But I've been around the block   I know that distances are meaningless   Like the hands that move around a clock   And I know that love is everywhere   Always safe, always true   And exactly where it comes from   Is where it's going to      Your heart to mine   My heart to yours   Talk about opening windows   Talk about opening doors   My heart to yours   Your heart to mine   Love is a light that shines   From heart to heart      Here I am sitting in old Hong Kong   The harbor and the lights   They're like diamonds in the heavens   Enough to brighten the darkest of nights   There's another side to sorrow   As there is to everything   Like the other side of lonely   Is falling in love again   And then you know that there's an answer   To the suffering we see   And though it isn't easy   It's still as simple as you and me   And you'll know that love is everywhere   Always safe, always true   And exactly where it comes from   Is where it's going to      Your heart to mine   My heart to yours   Talk about opening windows   Talk about opening doors   My heart to yours   Your heart to mine   Love is a light that shines   From heart to heart      Your heart to mine   My heart to yours   Talk about opening windows   Talk about opening doors   My heart to yours   Your heart to mine   Love is a light that shines   From heart to heart. The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job."

O..I swear your head is bigger than us all   Getting bigger   Go slit your own throat!.[Verse 2]   And I can't stop until the whole world knows my name,   Cause I was only born inside my dreams,   Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you,   Cause I am the opposite of amnesia..I can't get it out of my head   When you said   I'm gonna leave      I felt surprised   That you wanted to know   Where the geese go to   Late at night   I'm feeling fine   What is it inside   It's inside      And I can't get it out of my head   When he said   I'm leaving.I'll be loving you eternally (eternally)   There'll be no one new, my dear, for me (eternally)   Though the sky should fall   Remember I shall always be   Forever true (true)   And loving you (you)   Eternally....In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is about this girl named Saeng and her mother and grandmother. Flowers are beauitful to them they plant them all day. Picking them, @CAPS1 them. “Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye”    "
"..Tell me how can I run from something that I can't see?.The flags are waving, the news is breaking   See the man who can't pick out his own tie   If I've been taught from the beginning   Would my fears now be winning?.Oh damn..It's June in January   Because I'm in love..When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things"
"I pick up phones and hear my history..Come and take me down   The dark beyond   And take me there   Where I come from      Take me down   To the place where I'll kneel   And let me lay my shadow down   In though the eyes   Of a child's inner me   No pain to heal my bloodied brow      There is no rain   To save this silent town   There is no rain to save at all   There is no place   To save this silent ground   There is no place to save at all      Oh father take me   Unto where I'll lay me down   Oh Hallowed Ground      Oh the sky is falling   And I don't know where my home is now   My Hallowed Ground      Oh and can you take me   For I have tasted Hallowed Ground   Oh all around      Father - oh do you hear me   This pain I will not cry aloud      Father - I know you hear me   My head is bludgeoned but unbowed.My comfort, my shelter,   Tower of refuge and strength..Nobody, nobody      Say I make you feel like christmas time   Say I make you feel like christmas time   Tell me that I feel like christmas time   Put me in a party dress one time   Baby, if you love me you'll call me a bunny   Tell me I'm just a baby, honey   Meet me and tell me no one will love me   Better than you do   Better than you do      Dance me all around the room   Dance me around the room   Keep out the stars, turn out the lights   This little world is yours tonight   Dance me all around the room   Say you'll never leave me      Who has the face like smarty does?.Willow sky, whoa, I walk and wonder why,   They say love your brother, but you will catch it when you try.. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character doesn’t like this test. And would rather not take it"
"Is it really true   Everything I say and do   Is about you   Hey!....Am I nothing,   Am I no one?.Hmm, hmm..Get up   We're going out on the raz      Razzle dazzle   Call it what you want   To me it don't matter   It's where I belong   It's a matter of distinction   A real fine line   Between an orgy of destruction   And a wonderful time      This room's so cold and bare   There's nothing here for me   I've got to find some heat somewhere   Get up?.We'll cheer   For our campers our garden leaders to.. The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring."
"In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking..Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be   And I didn't know this, I didn't know this   Once you're above the city lights   Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own   The holding on is made for us   The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home      [Chorus: John Legend]   Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)   Go to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)   Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for   Can't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)   Penthouse floor      [Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]   I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh   Knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?.And they're breakin' off relationships and   Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores..It's cold down on the bayou   They say it's in your mind   But the moccasins are treadin' ice   And leavin strange designs   Cajuns say the last time   That this happend they weren't here   All Beaumont's full of penguins   And I'm a-playin' it by ear..Yeah!.

It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else."
"I've got a nightmare to remember   I'll never be the same..But there's a danger in loving somebody to much,   and it's bad when you know it's your heart they can't trust..Hot ashes for trees?.Here I go, falling down, down, down,   My mind is a blank,   My head is spinning around and around,   As I go deep into the funnel of love,   Deep into the funnel of love,   Deep into the funnel of love..Tell me   Why did you come here?. When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring."
"Not when both battle for dominance      Brush back my tears and he said ""girl   We have to soldier on   Yes girl even when we don't feel strong""   So how many young men have to lay down   Their life and their love of their woman   For some sick promise of a heaven      Lies go back now to the garden   Even the four horses say all bets are off      We're on the dark side of the sun   We're on the dark side of the sun   We're on the dark side of the sun      Soon there'll be fast food on the moon   Painted in neon with For Sale signs up   You say ""I'm more afraid of what   Tomorrow could bring to us""      Brushed back my tears and he said ""girl   You have to soldier on   Yes girl even when you don't feel strong""      So how many young men have to lay down   Their life and their love of their woman   For some sick promise of a heaven      Bushes burn there on the mountain   Abraham and Ishmael turn back the clock      We're on the dark side of the sun   We're on the dark side of the sun      We're on the dark side of the sun.This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated   And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected   And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit   Fuck      [Chorus]      Now I don't wanna hit no women when this chick's got it comin'   Someone betta' get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach   And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw 'er   Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force   And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort   But what's she shovin' me for?.Is the love still burning?.So much for sowing up   So this is growing up   Everything is going up for sale   The fog kept on rolling in   The time came to sink or swim   They say it's better to try and fail   And we tried like hell      I take a deep breath with my hand on the door   Afraid cause I'm not gonna see you anymore   These were our tender years, this was our street   All of our stop lights and all our concrete   Now it's all somebody else's to take   Until the fog rolls in.I can't skip desert..I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn’t melt in the spring geese don’t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    "
"But in a moment like this..What have you done to my heart?...Listen, I've been to the doctor lately..Down the way where the nights are gay   And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop   I took a trip on a sailing ship   But when I reached Jamaica I made her stop      Now I'm sad to say   I'm on my way (on my way)   I won't be back for many a day   My heart is down   My head is turning around   I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town      Sounds of laughter everywhere   And the dancing girls sway to and fro   I must declare my heart is there   Though I have been from Maine to Mexico      Still I'm sad to say   I'm on my way (on my way)   I won't be back for many a day   My heart is down   My head is turning around   I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town      Yeah, Robert G.

That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story."
"Yes, how many ears must one man have   Before he can hear people cry?.I love you just a little too much,   Love you just a little too much, much..I dunno      Ask me why, and I'll die   Oh, ask me why, and I'll die   And if you must, go to work - tomorrow   Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother   For there are brighter sides to life   And I should know, because I've seen them   But not very often   Under the iron bridge we kissed   And although I ended up with sore lips   It just wasn't like the old days anymore   No, it wasn't like those days   Am I still ill?.Climb on the horse and start to ride!.I'm so dumb, there is nothing to hate..The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it’s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng “cheep skip over live to you’re back she saw cheerfully” @CAPS1 it’s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to"

She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.” @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."

One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph."

Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason.

"Have a nice day   Have a nice day      Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,   It gets me through the night..From luxury to heartache   Such a long way to find that you were mourning   From luxury to heartache   Such a long way you gave me little warning      She will be there to give you children, yes she will   She will be there to make you sing, sing, sing   I won't be standing in the shadows anymore   I learned to cover up my pain      If I cry will you catch my fall   Do you want me to be the same   If I cry will you catch my fall   Am I playing the loser's game?.It's the last time you're gonna do it again      It's in your blood just to say goodbye   This time not for a while   So find your heaven, go on   You don't need me      So I will scream   Send it out to sea   And I will live a mile beyond   A mile beyond that heart of yours   Broken, ain't it torn   So you will leave for the last time   For the last time      Coming to you in the middle of a cold night   Can't arrest the sun but I've been trying   I hear a song floating off a tidal wave   It's alright, it's alright   Nothing gonna touch you when you've said goodbye   It's alright, it's alright   A million lost souls looking just like me   Waiting on their love but they don't believe      There's a million lost souls looking just like me   Waiting on permission but they don't believe      I will scream   And send it out to sea   Somewhere between the rock face   And the place that I used to know you more   Waiting on the shore   As you leave for the last time   I will see you leave for the last time   Until I breathe for the last time   And then I will leave for the last time.You don't know the meaning   Of the words ""I love you so""   But when you've found your one love   Then you'll know      You don't know the heartache   Or the laughter you'll forego   Until you've lost that one love   Then you'll know      Now you pretend to care for me   But honey, if you do   Why don't you give the kind of kiss   I always give to you      So, I've just made my mind up   Even though my tears will flow   Go on and find a new love   Then you'll know      [Repeat last two verses]      Then you'll know.'Cause you know you know that it's right..I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring the would have to start all over in growing this plant."
"When we finish tonight   I'll guarantee that you'll be calling me back   For some more, more, more!.(hoo yeah)   Well I'm doin' alright, blues how are you?.Put on your best suit, get your arms around me   Now we're going down down down   ""Ladies and gentlemen, be obscene!.Cos you're keeping me up all night      I don't wanna rock, DJ   But you're making me feel so nice   When's it gonna stop, DJ?.They know that Santa's on his way   He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh   And every mother's child is gonna spy   To see if reindeer really know how to fly..The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she wai’t be able to see the hibiscus .she is used to  going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant In conclusion the author concludes the story that way, because in the winter time she wai’t see  her plant.

The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight you’ll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people."

"Transylvania..and hard   As we sat upon our mother in the graveyard   And you don't have to listen   To a word in this song   Your picture hangs the same and in the same old place   Even though that you've gone   Even though that you've gone   Cos. one thing I never said to you   And one thing I never can   Amongst the false applause and the deafening cheers   I'm your No..I think they suck and my friends agree..But everything we talked about is gone   And the only chance we have of moving on   Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong      Before the worst   Before we met   Before our hearts decided it's time to love again   Before today   Before too long   Let's try and take it back before it all went wrong      There was a time that we'd stay up all night   Best friends, yeah, talking til the daylight   Took the joys alongside the pain   With not much to lose but so much to gain      Are you hearing me?.Big wheels keep on turning   Carry me home to see my kin   Singing songs about the Southland   I miss Alabamy once again   And I think it's a sin, yes   Well I heard mister Young sing about her   Well, I heard ole Neil put her down   Well, I hope Neil Young will remember   A Southern man don't need him around anyhow      Sweet home Alabama   Where the skies are so blue   Sweet Home Alabama   Lord, I'm coming home to you      In Birmingham they love the governor   Now we all did what we could do   Now Watergate does not bother me   Does your conscience bother you?.Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the spring time comes, then she is going to take that test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time."
"And mostly what I need from you..Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me   Oh yes, you are   Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me      Oh, ooh, yeah, no point regretting that it didn't last   No point regretting that it went so fast   Time that we had was like sand in our hands   But when I look behind, I'm so glad that you were mine      I remember taking you home on that 86   Standing in your doorway where we use to kiss   Then your dad came out and chased me down the street   If you remember just how scared I use to be      Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me   I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now   I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me      Bumped into Irene down in Waterloo   She told me that you got yourself somebody new   She said you musta like him 'cause he's, oh, so nice   But I remember that you like a pinch of spice, well I      I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now   I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now      I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now   I know, wherever you go   That you'll be thinking about me now.Well she feel like dying,   But she's only twenty-one..All around me I see danger   And it's closing in on me   Every second I can hear it breathing   I can't stand the fear inside me   Cause it's leading me astray   And it will be my ending      I'm searching   I'm fighting for a way to get through   To turn it away      It's waiting, always trying   I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating   Tell me what's the reason   Is it all inside my head   Can't take it no more!.He was the hero of the Bowery, a prince of lawless times..“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them."

Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said “yes| when she planted the hibiscus."
