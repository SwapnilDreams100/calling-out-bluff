"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test..Oh, reggae!.Killing   In the name of God..Look closer my brother, we're killing each other   And we'd better stop and get started today   Because life is the question and life is the answer   And God is the reason and love is the way..Hmm, hmm..It's been a long lonely winter (winter)   Illumination bright   Fading the volume and light   Reanimated by fire (fire)   Transformation      Become the nexus of the sound."
"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story “Winter Hibiscus”, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, “.. in the spring...” it’s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It’s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  .Crestfallen still..People starving all over the land what a low   Down dirty shame and abroad we see the same we have our selves to blame..Southbound pachyderm..Yo Yuk plus L.T equals very roll deep   Gold teeth, fat belly's like Forty Fonzarelli   Niggas smell me, so while you twerkin   Surfin on the block hurtin   I went huntin',workin excursions (Oh boy!).Yes it's true, right from the start,   I believed in the church of your heart."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” made a good choice to conclude the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.” This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become “almost familiar to her now” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng’s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her “obstacle,” and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng’s life will have come full circle..Alabama Man!.(By my side)   'Cause I love you in such a way..Old Mister Webster could never define   what's being said between your heart and mine..Nothing matters when I'm with my ba-a-by   With my back turned looking down the path      We'll go walkin' hand in hand   Laughin' fit to beat the band   With our backs turned looking down the path      People always ask me why   What's the matter with me?.It was just my imagination   Runnin' away with me."
"The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam.I'll never stop loving you..Here is my heart you can take it   There's a time in your life for believing   That impossible dream in your heart   When you find in one magical moment   The one you search for from the start   On a night like tonight when you're holding me   I can see in your eyes, it's you I've dreamed of   Here is my heart, you can take it   Love so strong, can't be wrong   Here is my heart, please don't break it   Come what may, here I'll stay   Here is my heart only for you   If I gave you the keys of a kingdom   If I dressed you in diamonds and pearls   It would never compare to the feeling   We have together right now   On a night like tonight, you're everything   For once in my life, it feels like Heaven   Here is my heart, you can take it   Love so strong, can't be wrong   Here is my heart, please don't break it   Come what may, here I'll stay   Here is my heart, only for you   Here is my heart, now and forever yours   Making love under the stars   Paradise is where we are   Living it up, we'll never stop   Dancing together   Round and round and round, we go   Feel the rhythm in your soul   Nothing is going to stop us   When we're dancing together   All night long forever   Here is my heart, you can take it   Here is my heart, please don't break it   Here is my heart, you can take it   Love so strong, can't be wrong   Here is my heart, please don't break it   Come what may, here I'll stay   Here is my heart   Here is my heart   Love so strong, can't be wrong   (Come on and take it)   Here is my heart, please don't break it   (Come on and take it)   Come what may, here I'll stay   Please don't break it   Don't break it, girl   Ohh, here is my heart   Here is my heart   Now and forever yours.So what could I do but sit and look around?.Why do you cheat and why do you lie?.James Brown   Hey Good luck hey   Good luck hey   Ha!"
"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese..Warm like the month of May it was,   And I'll say it was grand..She did not ever seem to know me,   But, now it's much too late to show me..When I was an all-aloner   Nothing but a two-beach comber   Anybody seen the sky?.We fell in love on a hot summer night   I looked at her she at me   Love at first sight   I made a lover's vow   She'd be mine   I said I'd love her 'till the end of time   And when she said   Does it feel good   Does it feel fine   I said yeah yeah yeah      Do bist der star unserer tage   Do und ich, no way back, keine frage   You're the lucky one   The star of moon and sun      Love is a strange phenomenon   It makes you happy, sad, it's never fun   Boy meets girl, heart meets heart   Like tigers, they tear each other apart   But when you say does it feel good   Does it feel fine   I say yeah yeah yeah      Do bist der star unserer tage   Do und ich, no way back, keine frage   You're the lucky one   The star of moon and sun.Hold me this time."
"The author concludes this story, “Winter Hibiscus,” with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver’s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, “That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,”…in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.’ The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   .I am not your own motherrrrrr,oh no   Listen mother i did told you this oh no,oh no   Listen mother i did not told you this one,oh no   Like you should care about me?.I've had no sleep, sad songs..It's all a dream..Cry for me, cry for me!.When you finally come so pretty      Bitch we have got a problem   There's not enough to hitting it      Getting off   I'm getting off   Keep getting off   Keep getting off   I'm getting off   I'm getting off to you   It's not enough   It's not enough   It's more than will ever be enough   I'm getting off   I'm getting off to you      Dip your hands right in (go with it)   Come on rush my sin (go with it)   You can let me in (go with it)   Wonder where I've been (I'll stick it)      Licking your own skin, so trippy   Squeezing your own ass, so pretty   Suck the ways it's used for chilling?"
"“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter..(Yea!.One for the money, yes sir, two for the show   A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe   Was the start of something good   Where me and my nigga rode the Marta, through the hood   Just tryna find that hook up, now everyday we looked up at the ceiling   Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling   Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper   We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur   Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light   Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock   Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop, like ""Freeze!"".Verse 1:   I don't wanna waste a second,   I don't wanna waste a moment..Johnny was bad, even as a child everybody could tell,   Everyone said, ""If you don't get straight   You'll surely go to hell."".Back to the promised land      He loved guns and roses,   Guns and roses   He loved guns and roses,   He loved guns   And roses, roses, roses      I can feel it coming in the island tonight   ..."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels..Feeling the beat of my heart   Feeling the beat of my heart   Ooh feeling, feeling, feeling   Feeling every feeling..Or should I run on by, ah, ha      Here she comes   Here she comes   Shadows sadly chasing   Every step she takes   Look at her now   She needs love so much more somehow   See all her faces   See all her faces      Look at my life   The wasted years   Each a knife   See all her faces, ah-ha   See all her faces      Waiting for someone   Who will set me free   Passing the time too fast   Waiting for someone   Is that where he'll be?.She's out..He who shouts the loudest   Is the one who's in control   We who never listen   Are the ones who pay the toll   Tell us that it's time at last   To make a final stand   I'm glad 'cause all I wanted   Was to kill another man   Just to kill another man..Who then can warm my soul?"
"The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she’ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that “many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.” And when she’s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  .Day after day I'm more confused   Yet I look for the light   Through the pourin' rain   You know that's a game that I hate to lose   And I'm feeling the strain   Ain't it a shame      Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll   And drift away   [repeat]      Beginning to think that I'm wasting time   I don't understand the things I do   The world outside looks so unkind   Now I'm counting on you   To carry me through      Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll   And drift away   [repeat]      And when my mind is free   You know a melody can move me   And when I'm feeling blue   The guitar's coming through to soothe me      Thanks for the joy that you're given me   I want you to know I believe in your song   Your rhythm and rhyme and harmony   You've helped me along   Makin' me strong      Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul   I want to get lost in your rock and roll   And drift away   [repeat]   Na, na, now won't ya   Won't ya take, oh ha ..take me.Beyond all this goo's is the terror,   The grip of a mercenary hand,   When savagery turns all good reason,   There's no turning back, no last stand..And I couldn't stand looking at your face, right?.I hope it finds me in time      Love needs a heart and I need to find   If love needs a heart like mine.Old King Soul, he finally gave us a jolt,   He played the vibes 'til nine and read from ten to four."
"Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, “when they come back”, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the “hibiscus is budding” then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready..No loving and no praying   All my hate is for the taking      I'm, I am filthy   Wasted piece of shit   I am disgusting   Take me, away      We got a fucked up reason to live   Who really gives a fuck?.Tell me this, would you take a bullet for me?.Feel the magic when I hold you   Cry sweet tears of joy, touch the sky      Now I need you more than ever..Everybody, everybody, everybody cries..""Dahnt-dahn""   ""Dahnt-dahn""   ""A-Dahnt-dahn""   ""A-Dahnt-dahn""   ""A-Dahnt-dahn""..."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver’s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“…and this hibiscus is budding…”), the author depicts Saeng’s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver’s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng’s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng’s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (“…when the snow melts and the geese return…”). This shows Saeng’s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes..How many ears must one man have   Before he can hear people cry?.When will they ever learn?.In the field of opportunity   It's plowin' time again..Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,   Don't wanna amuse nobody, don't wanna be amused..What's wrong with this picture   Her eyes are like moons   It's just like looking   In two empty rooms   She's looking so fragile   As thin as an eel   What's wrong with this picture   What does it reveal   Beauty speaks   There's so much to say   Tell me what's wrong with this picture today      What's wrong with this picture   She's lighter than air   Life seems to be happening   But she is not there   The late night temptation   The eyes on her skin   What's wrong with this picture   There's nobody in      What's wrong with this picture   Location withdrawn   It's empty without you   Your face so forlorn      Shake yourself   Sweep you head away   Tell me what's wrong with this picture today"
"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time “when the shows me”. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage..Only the ones who believe   Ever see what they dream,   Ever dream what comes true..If you gave me nine lives like a tommy cat   I'd give 'em all to you and never take one back      Ain't that loving you baby?.You will soon be me..Signed promise for moments caught within the spell   I must have waited all my life for this   Moment moment      The future poised with the splendour just begun   The light we were as one   And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun      And for a moment when our world had filled the skies   Magic turned our eyes   To feast on the treasure set for our strange device      What happened to wonders we once knew so well?.But my eyes burn   Cloud, come   Shove it, shove it, shove it   Shove   Shove it   The sun   Aside   Cloud, come   Shove it, shove it, shove it   Shove   Shove it, shove it, shove it   The sun   Shove it, shove it, shove it   Aside   I think God is moving his tongue   There's no crowds in the streets   And no sun   In my own summer"
"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, “She lifted her head.” This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, “when the snow melts and the geese return,” this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, “and this hibiscus budding” she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it’s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring..You straight from the Georgia woods..Feds want me and bug di phone,   Two way connect..My obsession   Your desire   Come let me lead you   To the fire   Show some mercy   My pounding heart   Can't take much more of this   You've got play your part   Bodies yearning   Is this for real?.Well northern Georgia highway 41   Beside the carpet mills and the gas stations   There was a music store slash radio shack   With the sound of dreamers jammin' in the back   Well we rocked all night and we rolled all day   We never bought nothing but we sure did play   The music was loud and the girls were pretty   There was always a magic down at Pete's Music City   Well we had electric guitars just a gathering dust   And a chrome mike stand with just a little bit of rust   And a couple of amps with the volume on ten   And when the last bell ringed that's when the music began   And we rocked all night...   [ guitar ]   Well the years have been long and they ain't been kind   They say all that's left is the old faded sign   But the music's still ringing loud in my heart   Down at Pete's Music City where I got my start   Well we rocked all night....Refrain:   He for our salvation   Left God's habitation,   Yes, He left God's habitation."
" In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her “ gentle grandmother” from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story “Winter Hibiscus “ with the paragraph selected..Now your sad eyes reveal   Just how badly you feel..wait til you see my dick   Wait til you see my dick   Ay bitch!.Just when I believed I couldn't ever want for more   This ever changing world pushes me through another door   I saw you smile   And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face   Just for awhile   Won't you let me shelter you      [Chorus]   Hold on to the nights   Hold on to the memories   I wish that I could give you something more   That I could be yours      How do we explain something that took us by surprise   Promises in vain, love that is real but in disguise   What happens now   Do we break another rule   Let our lovers play the fool   I don't know how   To stop feeling this way      [Chorus]      Well, I think that I've been true to everybody else but me   And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free   Every time I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware   That the someone I've been searching for is right there      [Chorus].Chorus:   There are those who live to take the chance   And then more who find themselves content   I see heaven mapped out in advance   It is you and that's my journeys end, in a dream, this living dream..I feel it in my heart, take away my pain."
"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,”When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don’t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again..I've been painting by numbers you've been   Just splashing them on the wall..Our love is immortal, don't you know?.My friends all tell me that I look so sad   They don't need to ask me why   They know the reason that I feel so bad   Since the night you said goodbye   It's not the letters that you just don't write   It's not the arms of some new friend   It's not the crying in the dead of the night   That keeps me hanging on, waiting for the end..Chorus      Have we forgotten the suffering and pain   The survivors and victims of the fire in Artane,   The mothers and fathers forever to mourn   The 48 children who never came home..Took a chance, rolled the dice on me and you   Opened up, let you in my world   Like a dance, started slow and then love took control   Swept away, so proud to be your girl   But when you write a story much to fast   Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last      [Chorus]   Now I know that love ain't meant to be a plaything   Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing   Now I know that when this ride is so amazing   When it's wrong you gotta let it go   Now I know   Now I know      Remember when, we said our love would last forever   But then again, how are we to know   There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather   A sunny day can suddenly turn cold   Time will teach you all you need to learn   But there'll always be a first time you get burned      [Chorus]      I don't regret a single day   The joy and pain along the way   A broken heart's the price we pay   As sad as it may seem   Baby can't you see   It's the way it's gotta be      [Chorus]      Yeah   Now I know   I know"
"The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. “the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is “strong enough to make it through the cold months that’s what matters.” This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar”. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it’s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   .Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind   Following them fairgrounds a-calling..With nothing but tears?.They interviewed the kid   Oh, training they forbid   Because Yoda sensed in him much fear   And Qui-Gon said, ""Now listen here   Just stick it in your pointy ear   I still will teach this boy""      He was singin' my my, this here Anakin guy   May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry   And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye   Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,   Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""      We caught a ride back to Naboo   Cause Queen Amidala wanted to   I frankly would've liked to stay   We all fought in that epic war   And it wasn't long at all before   Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day   And in the end some Gungans died   Some ships blew up and some pilots fried   A lot of folks were croakin'   The battle droids were broken   And the Jedi I admire most   Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast   Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost   I guess I'll train this boy      And I was singin', my my, this here Anakin guy   May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry   And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye   Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi   Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""   We were singin', my my, this here Anakin guy   May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry   And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye   Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"".[Chorus]   Every time your lips touch another   I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me   Every time you dance with somebody   I want you to feel me, I want you to feel me   Do your days get a little bit lonely?.I got to have you baby   Don't you say that you don't care   I got to have you baby   Don't you say that you don't care   Any way you want it baby   I'll settle for a back door love affair"
"In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  .Ok I see you checking me out (checking me out)   I think I know what you winkin' about (winking about)   You wit your man you don't want him to see (want him to see)   It's alright with me      I know I drank I little bit much (hey)   You think I'm talking crazy and such (hey)   I can't walk straight but girl I can see   You're alright with me      [Chorus]   Alright   I see a little something that I like   You lookin' mighty fine in them skin tights   You know what I mean   It's alright with me   Hold up   I know you got a man but I'm   Tore up   And I don't even care if he   Roll up   With something to say   You better tell him he don't want it with me   It's alright      Yeah yeah yeah yeah-yeah   Yeah yeah yeah yeah-yeah   Yeah yeah yeah yeah-yeah   Yeah yeah yeah yeah-yeah      Good Lord you got body for days (body for days)   I think the way that you shake it's amazing (shake it's amazing)   I got my keys if you ready to leave (ready to leave)   It's alright with me   Come check your man 'cause he going insane (sane)   He want to know what the hell's my name (hey)   Well if he crazy 'nough to get in my face   It's alright with me      [Chorus]      Come on why don't you test me (test me)   If you want me come and get me (get me)   I'll show you who the best be (best be)   I'll watch you for a long time (long time)   I swear you're looking alright (alright)   Come closer if you like what you see   It's alright with me      [Chorus]      It's alright yes it's alright   It's alright yes it's alright   It's alright yes it's alright      It's alright yes it's alright   It's alright yes it's alright   It's alright yes it's alright      Yeah yeah yeah yeah-yeah.I found the?.Boom, Boom, Boom,   Every time you drop a bomb   You kill the god your child has born      Boom, Boom, Boom,   Every time you drop a bomb   You kill the god your child has born      Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom   Every time you drop the bomb.Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,   Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me..I send flowers everyday   But you just turn them away   And my letters go unanswered   So it seems      Was I just too blind to see   That you'd given up on me   And it's over now   Your broken heart won't mend      Just one more dance   Why don't we try   Holding each other   While the world stands still      You and I, were so much in love   And I would give anything   For the chance at romance   Just one more dance      Well I know I've been a fool   And I know that I've been cruel   When you give your love completely   Heart and soul      'Let it slipped right through my hands   Can't you ever understand   I've never felt this kind of love before      Just one more dance   Why don't we try   Holding each other   While the world stands still      You and I, are so much in love   And I would give anything   For the chance at romance   Just one more dance      My love has no pride   I'm dying inside   I'm down on my knees   I'm down on my knees   For your love      Just one more dance   Why don't we try   Holding each other   While the world stands still      You and I, are so much in love   And I would give anything   For the chance at romance   Just one more dance      Why don't we try   For the chance at romance   Just one more time      Why don't we try   For the chance at romance   Just one more time"
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus “ this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as “The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.” The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is “strong enough to make it through the cold months here”. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her”. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom..Well, I seem to stay down on the ground,   Baby, I'm too far gone to turn around..My place is not a home,   don't make no difference   but I have found that I need a place to stay,   I never listen what bud lord man gotta say,      You shoulda seen all the flops in my house   We were jumpin on walls and kickin ceilings   Nowadays people listen to me when I say get out,   Hold me and don't let go   Don't make no difference that your a hooker,   I need a place to stay   (disease is just the price I pay)      That show it used to be,   That girl is dead to me now,   All the time people want to know   The meaning of the name, anarchist?.I look for him because it's Christmas Eve..Three little ducks   Went out one day   Over the hill and far away   Mother duck said   ""Quack, quack, quack, quack."".I'm elected electric spy   I protected electric eye."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. .Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home..When I come through the door   I'm on the floor   You wanna see my ass shake yeah   Remix (ohhhhhhhhhhh!).There's a high wind in the trees,   A cold sound in the air,   And nobody ever knows when you go,   And where do you start,   Oh, into the dark..[Repeat until end].Turn it up   This is it!"
"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test “when the snow melts and the geese return.” I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver’s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author’s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver’s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  .At no time di the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon was drawn and he said, ""I'll shoot you"" or, ""I'm going to shoot"" and in the same moment, the first shot went off..When I wake up in the morning, love   And the sunlight hurts my eyes   And something without warning, love   Bears heavy on my mind      Then I look at you   And the world's all right with me   Just one look at you   And I know it's gonna be   A lovely day   lovely day, lovely day, lovely day      When the day that lies ahead of me   Seems impossible to face   When someone else instead of me   Always seems to know the way      Then I look at you   And the world's all right with me   Just one look at you   And I know it's gonna be   A lovely day      When the day that lies ahead of me   Seems impossible to face   When someone else instead of me   Always seems to know the way      Then I look at you   And the world's alright with me   Just one look at you   And I know it's gonna be   A lovely day.Y'all can be like me?.She's got her pudding in the oven   And it's gonna be good   She better not leave me   And go out to Hollywood   She got the best pudding in the neighborhood   She's my baby   She can drive a truck   She can drive a train (my baby, ma-ma my baby)   She can even drive an aeroplane   She's so good to look at in the rain   She's my baby   She's comin' down the sidewalk   She's stumblin through the door   She's coming home from places she's never been before   She sits down on the sofa   She poors herself a drink   Says, ""honey, honey, honey ain't no time to think""   My baby   My baby   My baby   She's got a body for business   Got a head for sin   She knocks me over like a bowling pin   She came home last night and said   ""Honey, honey, honey it's hard to get ahead."".If I were a train, I'd be late again."
"In “@CAPS1 Hibiscus” by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. “She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.” She can’t say home because home isn’t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion’s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does.We all, we all, we all, we all, we all   We all, we all, we all, we all, we all      I can pretend that I'm not lonely   But I'll be constantly fooling myself   I can pretend that it don't matter   But I'll be sitting here lying to myself   Some say love ain't worth the buck   But I'll give every dime I have left   To have what I've only been dreaming about      Everybody wants something   Better want something   What are you living for?.Riding a hurricane, tied to a ball and chain   Too much of a good good thing, it kind of stops you in your tracks   How did you ever get this far, now honey don't look back   And you best believing that all that's good is inside of you   Heh, inside of you, yeah      Ride on a carpet ride, high on the tears you cried   One's just too many but a thousands not enough   And you can't make up your mind playing blind mans bluff   And you best believing that all that's good is inside of you   Yeah, inside of you      It ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough   Ain't enough, I got to have it now ain't it tough   It ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough   ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough   Oh shit      You know another touch is easy, try and reach the sky   And though you can't get much more higher than you ever tried   When you die you're not forsaken   Best be taking tries of all the things that you're not taking      Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough   I got to have it ain't it tough   I got to have it      Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough   I got to have it      Ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough   Ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough   I got to have it      Ain't enough, I really got to have it   Ain't enough, I really got to have it   Ain't enough, I really got to have it.The end of flight number 505..Where did you come from cotton-eye Joe?.Yeah, I know you tried and tried,   But your signal I just missed,   When you said my little girl   would soon be gone,   Yes I didn't hear you then,   And it might be too late now,   That's another thing I'd do   differently."

"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “In the story it says, ”When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:– “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  .Well take it out in hate..And call my name..Do you remember me baby   Like I remember you?.We've simply grown too old for tales of knights and kings   'Cause life's a constant change   And nothing stays the same, oh no.If you're not here to turn the lights off, I can't sleep   These four walls and me      I lay in bed   Can't seem to leave your side   Your pillow's wet   From all these tears I've cried   I won't say goodbye      I tried to smile today   Then I realized there's no point anyway      In this time I've lost all sense of pride   I've called a thousand times   If I hear your voice I'll be fine      And I, I can't come alive   I want the room to take me under   'Cause I can't help but wonder   What if I had one more night for goodbye?"
"In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver’s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. “And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. “Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph..She's the one I need!.This can't wait anymore for your love..'He' will love me?.I felt the Spirit movin' deep down in my soul   I head the voice of Jesus say,   ""Sinner, I'll make you whole."".F is for fighting, R is for red,   Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed."
"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. “The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her..Talk it down..Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving   He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling   He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game   He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same   There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us   So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus      And it's all over now   Don't you worry no more   Gonna go west to the sea   The greyhound is swaying   And the radio is playing   Some blues for baby and me      And the highway looks like it never did   Lord it looks so sweet and so free   And I can't forget that trip to the west   Singing blues for baby and me      Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise   It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky   I called you my child, said honey now this is our game   There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again   There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us   So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus.Let's go let's go let go let go   Down to junior's farm   Where I want to lay low   How life high life   Let's go let's go take me to the junior's farm..I should be crying, but I just can't let it show..Once you tried,   Tried to get it right,   But you couldn't figure out what it takes,   To be liked,   You're grown up."
"In the story , “Winter Hibiscus”, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she’ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test..Inside, so deep in the heart of me   You've got this power I just can't explain   In this life, this world of insanity   I'm at your mercy when you call my name      Something in your touch defies all reason   With you passion rules   I never felt this much   But there was never anyone like you      [Chorus]      Take me through this fire, this raging wall of flames   Only you can break me from these chains      [Chorus]      Save me.Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,   Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,   Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know..One seems to hear words of good cheer   From everywhere, filling the air   O, how they pound, raising their sound   O'er hill and dale, telling their tale      Gaily they ring, while people sing   Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here!.(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)   (Woo woo woo woo woo woo)   (Woo woo woo woo woo woo)   My darlin' left me, didn't even tell me the reason why   Whoa, you packed up an' left me   Didn't even tell me the reason why   Whoa, if I didn't please you baby   Ain't because I didn't try   Well it was long about midnight, when I heard that old lonesome Cannonball   Well it was long about midnight, when I heard that old lonesome Cannonball   Well when I think about you baby, tears begin to fall   (Woo woo woo woo woo woo)   (Woo woo woo woo woo woo)   (Woo woo woo woo woo woo)   I've gotta find you baby, if it takes my whole life to track you down   I've gotta find you baby, if it takes my whole life to track you down   Well if I don't find you by plane, I'm gonna use my old bloodhound   (Woo woo woo woo woo woo)   (Fading:)   (Woo woo woo woo woo woo)   (Woo woo woo woo woo woo).It's in me,   And you know it's for real."
" In the story “winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says “let me help mother.” This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng’s commitment..[chorus]   Play me a dancer, a holder-hander, or honky-tonker,   Pull-her-up-closer, slow romancer,   Make her fall in love with me song..""I Love a Sunflower,"" and I believe in love power, Love Power, Love Power!!!!.I been bad to you,   Baby, you know it..Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac..I knock off with a lot on my mind   From a long hard day   Pull in at home, see you and find   My stress slipping away   Then you run to my arms   and give me a kiss   And nothing else matters   When you hold me like this      (Chorus)   Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man   To win your heart all over again   Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste   Nothing but you   I'm in the mood to close the door   Make love tonight like never before   Rush after rush, like waves on the shore   Girl, I'm in the mood   All day long I'm so strong   Then I hear you speak   I'm drawn to your fire, your signs of desire   Girl, you make me weak   I go drifting away   Like a leaf in the wind   I'm under a spell   Your touch put me in   Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man   To win your heart all over again   Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste   Nothing but you   Yeah, I'm in the mood to close the door   Make love tonight like never before   Rush after rush, like waves on the shore   Girl, I'm in the mood"
"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both @CAPS1 is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home oF Vietnam very much. However, both oF them must and will adOpt to their new environments...You're always alive..I've shown you all the places I'm dreaming of   I'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun   We are seventeen, we have just begun   I have loved to fight for and then some   You are the one, the one, the one, the one,   The one, the one, the one, the one      Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed   We'll fly into the garden like butterflies   There will be no blood and there will be no pain   I want to fall in love with you again, again,   Again, again, again, again, again, again   Again, again      You have stolen all my senses   There's a fever in my heart   And you are taking my defenses   You are pulling me apart   Forever we are and we are dying   And we still be standing on our ground   So I will take away my feeling   I will be an animal   An animal      I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you   We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth   I'll color in the sky, and I'll color you   I want to join your skin again, again,   Again, again, again, again, again, again   Again      You have stolen all my senses   There's a fever in my heart   And you are taking my defenses   You are pulling me apart   Forever we are and we are dying   And we still be standing on our ground   So I will take away my feeling   I will be an animal   An animal      We will run away from danger   We will run away      I-I-I-I-I will fight for      You have stolen all my senses   There's a fever in my heart   And you are taking my defenses   You are pulling me apart   Forever we are and we are dying   And we still be standing on our ground   So I will take away my feeling   I will be an animal   An animal.From this day on I swear to you..If I get drunk, (If I get drunk, ) well I know I'm gonna be   I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you, (yeah) Yes!.All this feeling here inside   One word ain't enough   The way to say it seems to hide   How can I say love?"
"The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng’s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is “strong enough to make ith through the cold months here… that is what matters,” this makes a connection between the plant and the author’s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she’ll wait until spring to take the test again.   .Melvin Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay..There's no parking places in Grand Street   Chocolate Rain!.I owe my soul to the company store..Cuz your body all on me my head spinnin round and round   Can we make this a nasty party   Cuz I just want your body on mine, body on mine,   Take me down, take me down!.So, if you're travelin' down   Louisiana way,   And you feel kinda lonesome   And you need a place to stay,   Man, you're better off   In your misery   Than to tackle that lady   At one-oh-three."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too..How do you feel?.Please be wrong   Please don't tell me it's really you   Tell me eyes,tell my heart what I'm goin' through   I believed, I believed I was over you      If he should break your heart   I'll always know where you are   If you should fall apart   I'll be there, I'll be around   If he should break your heart   I'll be there      Is this right   I don't care I'm alone with you   Here we are, once again you've got someone new   Lonely hands, please don't do what you want to do      If he should break your heart   I'll always know where you are   If you should fall apart   I'll be there, I'll be around      If he should break your heart   From my soul I say good-bye yesterday   One more night alone, without the touch of you   Then I start to break is it my mistake   Tell me am I wrong for holdin' on to you      If he should break your heart   I'll always know where you are   If you should fall apart   I'll be there, I'll be around      If he should break you heart, I'll be there   If he should break your, if he should break your   If he should break your heart   I'll be there, I'll be around.Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'   That they're lookin' forward to..We've all got dirty minds..time goes by, are you waiting   For another day?"
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represent saeng’s determination and the situation she has now. She just come to the new country and she haven’t adjusted herself to this new country yet. She was disappointed like “mashaft of the war afternoon starlight.” “war” showed saeng was ery upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much “snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. “spring” symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. She would succeed in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion. It symbolizes hope..She's so big hearted,   But not so remarkable   just an ordinary humble girl   expecting nothing as we're made to think   Its a pretty person's world   but you are beautiful and you better go show it   go look again, you gotta be true to your own   if you really wanna go to the top   do you really wanna win?.Good evening Ladies and Gentleman I'm Niah Pitson I'm standing in front of the historic Manns chinese theatre where thousands literally thousands of fans, journalists and well wishers have gathered merely to catch a glimpse of the artists formerly known as fresh prince..oh (Which flower's going to grow?).I might as well be makin' a bomb   I'm layin' down a foundation when I'm takin' you on   Bet the fall of the rhyme for the sake of my mom   She's like ""Mike show these pigs what kind of bacon you're on""   It's funny but don't laugh, money with no cash   The real of the vocab, killin' is no path   The realest to romat, don't even know half   I'm rankin' a full tank you're runnin' on low gas      [Hook]   Take that, crack off your fund,   You're nothin' but a butternife stoppin' a gun   You can dance with your chances slim and none   You can take it I have finished I have not begun      Gotta razor blade tongue   And I kid this done   No wonder just dumpin' on your crew for fun   Machine stop got it locked like the game's a joke   Say summin' funny get the whole gang to vote   Let 'em pucka now f-cka go get your own   We've been roamed ten years since we did this note   The people on the block start to get numb   They expect it it's fresh when the new sh-t come   It grows, let 'em know they can fix around   Railroad, rap hot tracks one and you're down   And they're askin' repeat how I do this now   Like I'm really gonna tell 'em how I get this sound   We just doin' what we do gettin' from that place   We come in the back like we're on this b-tch   Turn the lights down low when we start this show   What, you two get me right back in the go      [Hook]   It's take that, take that, cuttin' if your fun   You're nothin' but a butternife stoppin' a gun   You can dance with your chances slim to none   You can think that I am finished I have not begun      Follow me I got styles you can chop me one   Back in line I know you wanna stop me son   But I got news for you f-cka that cannot be done   You can think that I am finished I have not begun.Cause you got...      Who is she?"
"I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it’s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she’ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus “comes back to life’’. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she’ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she’s stating once everything “come back to life” then she’ll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared..Since you're gone   There is an empty space   Since you're gone   The world is not the same      I go back to the places we've been   It feels like you're still there   I live all those moments again   Wishing you were here      Since you're gone   There is an lonely heart   Since you're gone   Nothin' is like it was      There are memories all over the place   Bringin' it back all so clear   Remember all of those days   Wishing you were here      All those lonely nights   I gotta fight for you, yes I do   Yes I do      Since you're gone   There is a heart that bleeds   Since you're gone   I'm not the man I used to be      I follow you steps in the snow   The traces disappear   We know what we've lost when it's gone   I'm wishing you were here      All those lonely nights   I gotta fight for you, yes I do   Yes I do.(Please help me, please help me).Gets really high..Should I let the feeling flow?.They shut the Dogg down when he reach the max   Whatcha trying to drink, clearer yet?"
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.” I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home. .Cause I get allot of that(I get allot of that)   Put your hands in the air if you get allot of that(if you get a lot of that) I get allot of that   Put your hands in the air if you get allot of that      [Chorus: x2]   Let's talk about hate cause I get allot of that   Talk about money cause I get allot of that   (I get allot of that, I get allot of that, I get allot of that,)   Cause I get allot of that      This can't be it man this shit is stress full   Is that what it is I'm just successful,   Maybe I'm to good to hood low down no good   I just keep shit real just like you should,   Twist my fingers throw up my hood   Let's get this money I know I would   I know that's right but still we do wrong   J-bo got 30 but still we moved on   Get them clamps out   Get my groove on   I stay iced out   Get my cool on   Best be cool homes   Get my goon on   I'll bust them to homes   Get my lose on      [Chorus]      They say young fell off yeah the boy done lost it   Been porting all my life baby I'm just exhausted   I take a Gatorade break to get everything straight   Now I'm sitting here like how much Gatorade make   How much money would it take to make some mo money   Damn right a nigga straight come get some mo from me   I sold millions made them millions   But still yaw doubt me what's this with out me   Can't be that bad still got my trap swag   And every time I do a show I leave with a trap bag   Money in trash bags   I call that garbage   20 thousand a trash bag   It looks like garbage      [Chorus]      I get allot of that allot of this   I need allot of it   Sit on my bedroom floor counting all of it   That money be Ludacris   It just might shock you   If you can't find Chaka then my right hands keep it   Look I am simply on of the best   Can't even lie i can't vouch for the depressed   Just like zip-lock they get killed in the plastic   Best add five grams so you can weigh it in plastic   I am so dirty they wrap me in plastic   When they wrap me in plastic need to put me in traffic   They say that I'm difficult even different   Show me the difference I'll bring you the difference      [Chorus].Fremon nell'anima dolcezze estreme,   Ecc Nel baccio freme amor!.La la la   Love is the real thing   You know   Love is the real thing   La la la la   La love   La la la   Love is the real thing   You know   Love is the real thing   La la la la      She is waiting   In the office   For the bell to go   She is thinking   Of their meeting   Just a month ago   Now she's running   Through the people   Everyone so slow   Now he holds her   And he loves her   He tells her so and      La la la   Love is the real thing   You know   Love is the real thing   La la la la   La love   La la la   Love is the real thing   You know   Love is the real thing   La la la la      By the nightfall   They have driven   From the world they know   She's so happy   They're together   And their love will grow      And when you feel your chance has come   Who's going to throw it all away   And if there's someone left behind   You have to say that      La la la   Love is the real thing   You know   Love is the real thing   La la la la      La love   La la la   Love is the real thing   You know   Love is the real thing   La la la la      La la la   Love is the real thing   You know   Love is the real thing   La la la la   La love   La la la   Love is the real thing   You know   Love is the real thing   La la la la.Night and you and Blue Hawaii   The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me   Lovely you and Blue Hawaii   With all this loveliness there should be love      Come with me while the moon is on the sea   The night is young and so are we, so are we      Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii   And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you      Come with me while the moon is on the sea (the moon is on the sea)   The night is young and so are we (so are we)      Dreams come true in Blue Hawaii   And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you.One by one, from the mountains to the sea,   Points of light, are calling out to you and me."
"In the story, “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- “I mean its not the kind we at-at-“ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home..I said, ""Baby, this is meant for me, me, me, me."".""Who could ask for anything more?.[Hook]   Shut up when I'm talking to you!.I said, baby,   Why don't you be my girl?.Your love endures forever   Reaches beyond the heavens   I will praise, I will praise   Your love is better than life   Your name alone satisfies   I will sing, I will sing      You are my God, You are my song   You are my love, I am found in You   Your holiness, Your majesty   Your presence fills my life   And the earth will shake, the skies light up   They join with us   Live to make Your praises glorious, glorious      No longer I who live it   It's Christ who lives in me   I am Yours, I am Yours   I'm planted deep within You   My heart and soul will sing   Forevermore, forevermore      You are my God, You are my song   You are my love, I am found in You   Your holiness, Your majesty   Your presence fills my life   And the earth will shake, the skies light up   They join with us   Live to make Your praises glorious, glorious"
"The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the “ winter hibiscus”. Then later in the story she says how ,”many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .” That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,”then she will take that test again.”therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  .Oh!.Well it seems like our fate to suffer   And wait for the knowledge we seek   It's all his design, no one cuts in the line   No one here, likes a sneak      You got to fill out a form first   And then you wait in the line   You got to fill out a form first   And then you wait in the line      After you climb, up the ladder of time   The Lord God is here   Face to face, in the vastness of space   Your words disappear      And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love,   And the current is strong   But all that remains when you   Try to explain is a fragment of song      Lord is it, be bop a lu la   Or ooh poppa do   Lord, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do   Be bop a lu la.His name is Jesus, our risen King   Who is this King so mighty, Lord of strength?.Saw my life go flashin' past   In the eyes of a faithful friend   Four legs, four lives   And the screechin' tires never seem to end      I will change if Lester lives   Not mess him 'round just 'cause I own him   He was nearly wiped away   But he had good luck and strong bones      You make me clench my teeth   Us humans ain't got dignity   Eat my plants and steal my things   You're the head of security      I will change if Lester lives   Not mess him 'round just 'cause I own him   He was nearly wiped away   But he had good luck and strong bones   Inside and behind him      I will change if Lester lives   Not mess him 'round just 'cause I own him.Oodles of light what a beautiful sight   Both of God's eyes are shining tonight   Rays and beams of incredible dreams   And I am a quiet man."
"The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine. She is finally settling into her new life and says that “many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future..What Is Life   George Harrison      What I feel, I can't say   But my love is there for you anytime of day   But if it's not love that you need   Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed      Tell me, what is my life without your love   Tell me, who am I without you, by my side      What I know, I can do   If I give my love now to everyone like you   But if it's not love that you need   Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed      Tell me, what is my life without your love   Tell me, who am I without you, by my side   Tell me, what is my life without your love   Tell me, who am I without you, by my side      What I feel, I can't say   But my love is there for you any time of day   But if it's not love that you need   Then I'll try my best to make everything succeed      Tell me, what is my life without your love   Tell me, who am I without you, by my side   Oh tell me, what is my life without your love   Tell me, who am I without you, by my side      What is my life without your love   Tell me, who am I without you, by my side      Oh tell me, what is my life without your love   Tell me who am I without you by my side.Chorus:   You can't defeat him - he's fighting for freedom   That's all he wanted - that's all he needs   You'll never beat him with weapons and money   There ain't no chain as strong as the will to be free   Maybe his colors are driving you crazy   Call him a commie - maybe it's true   Lure him away from his home with your money   Give him the work that you don't want to do   Chorus:   You can't defeat him - he's fighting for freedom   That's all he wanted - that's all he needs   You'll never beat him with weapons and money   There ain't no chain as strong as the will to be free   See how we honor the struggle for freedom   They needed vision - we gave'em war   See who is patiently watching in silence   The crucification of el salvador   Chorus:   You can't defeat him - he's fighting for freedom   That's all he wanted - that's all he needs   You'll never beat him with weapons and money   There ain't no chain as strong as the will to be free.[Kokane]   In this times   Of hate and pain   We need a remedy   To help us through the rain   Can't you see   I'm straight up G.

" The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become… almost familiar now” that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions..Enlist ye Newfoundlanders and come follow me      They crossed the broad Atlantic in the brave Florizel,   And on the sands of Suvla, they entered into hell   And on those bloody beaches, the first of them fell....I might go down come the weekend, go on my own,   Drop off Annie and the baby, maybe drive alone..Fight!.Please come back, to my paradise..[Chorus:]      Wait a little while to welcome what you're after   Give it the time to find its way to you   And soon as you no longer try, you'll turn and find it standing by your side   Come and get it, when you let it, it'll come to you      When I run short on inspiration, I best recall what I've known all along   'N I remember sweet September's song, there never really has to be   A cold and bitter wind in front of me anymore      Just forget it and wait a little while, while, while   Wait a little while, everything will come to you in time   Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time   Wait a little while - every little thing's gonna come to you in time   Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time   Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time   Wait a little while"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng’s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about..[Chorus]      [Verse 3]   Yo, yo and when the sun drop   Back in Philly that don't mean that the fun stop   All it mean is that it's time to turn the lights on   All day long I been plotting on this nice john   It's ten o'clock now Jeff is trying to hype me   Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?.Ride, you wait to hug the shoal, you hate the thought, you're so-so..It's a long, long way from here to there   Silent shadows over the dateline   We both stare at the same blue moon   Under the sheltering sky      Some say love is the rarest word   Some say truth's just a point of contention   I know we have a love never mentioned   Under the sheltering sky      Will we wake from an endless dream   Will our worlds come tumbling around us   I can hear a silent scream   Crying in the night      Am I fading in your eyes   Is my memory clear as the day we met   For now we must both remain   Under the sheltering sky   Under the sheltering sky.Watching the people on the street today she couldn't help but smile   Watchin' the town go walking by all shaded eyes and alibis   Strange how much pain you can hide away beneath a well-cut suit   This is the day she walks away      And the lights of the city pushin' a good time   Asking her out tonight   But she's saving her money for a better life      She's got a map of the world   Pinned up on her wall   She's got a map of the world   She's gonna go and see it all   She's gonna see it all      Watchin the people on the street today   Such a lonely sight   'Swore she could see their dreams go by   All cars and stars and buy buy buy   Runnin on empty Runnin to stand still   No time for their own lives   Sleepwalking through the danger signs      And it feels a little scary   A little runaway   Letting go of all she's done   And the lights of the city, well they're all singin'   Buy some of this, c'mon   But when you lie to yourself   You lie to everyone      She's got a map of the world   Pinned up on her wall   She's got a map of the world   She's gonna go and see it all   She's gonna see it all      She'll empty the sand from her shoes   In Paradise   Sail out across the bay   She'll dance under an island sky   Until the break of day      She's got a map of the world   Pinned up on her wall   It's such a beautiful world   Glistening and magical      She's got a map of the world   Shining away in her mind   Colouring-in her life   This is the day she walks   She's gonna see it all   She's gonna breathe it all   Paris London New York   She's gonna see it all.You walk the streets   Righteousness but you refuse to understand      You say you love the baby   Then you crucify the man   You say you love the baby   Then you crucify the man      Everyday things are changing   Words once honored turned to lies   People wondering, can you blame them   It's too far to run and too late to hide      Now you turn your back on   All the things that you used to preach   Now it's, ""Let him live in freedom, if he lives like me""   Well, your light has changed, confusion rains   What have you become      All your olive branches turned to spears   When your flowers turned to guns   Your olive branches turned to spears   When your flowers turned to guns"
"The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the “test” again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng’s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she “failed the test”, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow..Hush hush, shh   Hush hush      I didn't mean to kiss you   You didn't mean to fall in love   I never meant to hurt you   We never meant for it to mean this much   Hush hush, now      I wanted to keep you   Forever next to me   You know that I still do   And all I wanted was to believe   Hush hush, now      So go on, live your life   So go on, say goodbye   So many questions   But I don't ask why   So this time I won't even try   Hush hush, now   Mmm, hush hush, now      When I try to forget you   I just keep on remembering   What we had was so true   And somehow we lost everything   Hush hush, now   (Hush hush, now)      So go on, live your life   So go on, say goodbye   So many questions   But I don't ask why, no   So go on, live your life   So go on, and say goodbye   So many questions   But I don't ask why   Maybe someday   But not tonight   Hush hush, now      Hush hush, now   Hush hush, now      Don't, don't, don't you ever say a word, word   Of what you ever thought you heard, heard   Don't you ever tell a soul   But you know   I tried to hide, but I still believe   We, that we were always meant to be, be   And I can't never let you go, no   Hush hush, now      So go on, live your life   So go on, and say goodbye   So many questions   But I don't ask why, no   So go on, live your life   So go on, and say goodbye   So many questions, but I don't ask why   Maybe someday   But not tonight   Hush hush, now, mmm   Hush hush, now, mmm   Hush hush,shh.And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me   Afraid of comin' in last..Please excuse, my tendency   To color everything I tell you   You don't understand   It takes me wherever I want to go      This is surely what I need   But I don't always think that way   And in the end   I can't help feeling      I must sober into this   I've got time   To build you up so tall   You won't fall down on me      I've got time   To build you up so tall   You won't fall down on me, down on me   Please excuse      My tendency   To color everything I tell you   But in my mind   There's nothing that really      Ever holds us from the truth   So I build My Ark for you   And I hope you do the same for me   In the end, I can't feeling      Just a sobering end to this   I've got time   To build you up so tall   You won't fall down on me      I've got time   To build you up so tall   You won't fall down on me, down on me.Boom!.lookin' for some changes   that no one wants to see   running round in circles   nowhere left to go   too many uniforms   tryin' to run this show   I don't know   it's never what i wanted   living in this heap   got to get the hell out   I'm in too fuckin' deep   this world is a crazy place   I'll take it day by day   lord, won't you help me   I got to get away   I don't know."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver’s test. To Saeng her failing the driver’s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng’s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn’t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     .The friends we know we meet along the way   Too soon the times we share form part of yesterday   'Cause life's a constant change   And nothing stays the same, oh no      Clouds that move across the skies   Are changing form before our very eyes      Why couldn't we keep time from movin' on?.I would be much obliged   To hear about   Your lonesome childhood   And the way   You were done in   By the folks back home   But that's all over now   You know   The future looks good   And I'm all   It takes   To make you happy      Sing   A little song for me   The one about   The day you gave up   Everything else   Everything else   Everything else      You know the reason   That I know   You just can't live   Without me   Is the way   You fall apart   When I'm not there   Your hair gets snarled   And you cannot tie   Your shoes   My pretty baby   And I'm all it takes   To make you happy      Sing   A little song for me   The one about   The day you gave up   Everything else   Everything else   Everything else      Sing   A little song for me   The one about   The day you gave up   Everything else   Everything else   Everything else      Just delight   In what you do not know   The rest is hazy   And you know   You're much too old   To be free      If you tried   To look beyond the deal   It would amaze me   Cause I'm all   It takes   To make you happy   I'm all   It takes   To make you happy.The innocence is gone   But still I'm holding on   Searchin' for love that lasts forever   Lookin' for a place   Where love can hide away   Takin' a chance it's now or never      Maybe it's time to draw the line   There's just one thing that's on my mind      Is it lust, is it love   Whatever it is I can't get enough   Is it lust, is it love   When I look around tell me who can I trust   Is it love      Lovers come and go   Sometimes it's hard to know   If this will be a night to treasure   When the damage has been done   And the hurting has begun   You'll justify a moment's pleasure      Is it lust, is it love   Whatever it is I can't get enough   Is it lust, is it love   It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above      Is it lust, is it love   When I look around tell me who can I trust   Is it love   Lust or love      Maybe it's time to draw the line   There's just one thing that's on my mind      Is it lust, is it love   Whatever it is I can't get enough   Is it lust, is it love   It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above      Is it lust, is it love   Still lookin' for more, it's never enough   Is it lust, is it love   When I look around tell me who can I trust      Is it love, is it love, is it love   Is it love, is it love.It took a lot of money   To start my heart,   To peg my leg and to buy my eye..Because we're here   Roll the bones   Why does it happen?"
"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, ”when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again”     .Well have you ever been experienced?.Fade away..Born under the sign of the Gemini twins   There's two sides to me and they ain't even friends   All sides are rising and there ain't no in between   When I'm bad I'm bad when I'm good I'm the best you ever seen..Yeah, easy rider don't you deny my name,   No no no no no, oh no..I've got a great idea   And wouldn't you like to know   You probably can't bear it   So I guess I'll have to share it   I thought of it a moment ago      It starts with your hand in mine   And next comes a little stroll   You probably won't buy it   But I'm trying to keep it quiet   So please don't tell a soul      'cause if you do   The world and you   Will think I'm crazy and give me medicine   They'll drag me away   And as I go you'll hear me say   I could have been a decent match for edison      Ideas are few and far between   And good ideas are rarer still   So listen and be wise   Just forget the other guys   'cause my idea's no good for three   My idea is you and me"
"The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower’s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower’s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages.Hey d-a-d-d-y,   I saw m-a-m-a cry..I never knew a man could tell so many lies   He had a different story for every set of eyes   How can he remember who he's talking to?.(Do you ever know?).Yeah   Mama told me, ""Your lady's lookin' for another man""   I never worry, there ain't a need for me to take no stand   I got my reasons, the things I do are better left unsaid   I'm into pleasin', I do my talkin' with my hands instead      'Cause I can make some time   You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine   You're starin' at the man, you want to land   A six foot, hot look, all American man, yeah      I've been to Detroit, I've been to L.A. and I've seen St. Lou   I've had some good times, but I've been waitin' for a girl like you      'Cause I can make some time   You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine   You're starin' at the man, you want to land   A six foot, hot look, all American man, yeah      All American man   'Cause I can make some time   You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine   You're starin' at the man, you want to land   A six foot, hot look, all American man, a man      I'm a six foot, hot look, all American man, yeah.[Chorus]      Do you think about all the books   You haven't read?"
"Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she’s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, “and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism – each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph..I said she's out of sight ??.Oh, I read it in the tabloids..love like yours will surely come my way..Fairy stories ??.Just me an' the blues!"
"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says “when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story “Winter Hibiscus” used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story..It is the music of a people   Who are climbing to the light..Ya'll niggas don't wanna fuck with the Fam   Get rid of that lame   Get rid of that   We about to girl   We about to girl   Come fuck with this girl.Girl, I can't believe my ears..No man has ever felt a love,   So deep..Eyes so bright, so big and wide   Make you feel so strange   Somewhere deep inside   It's the face of an angel   Soul of the devil may care      How I'd love to know   What goes on in there      She needs your love   She needs it every day   But speak of love   See her laugh and run away      Julia, which way will you go   Julia, I want to know   Julia, only the moon and stars   Julia, know just where you are   Julia      See the dance that needs no alibi   Oh you don't need to dream   When you know you can fly      She needs your love   She needs it every day   But speak of love   See her laugh and run away      Julia, which way will you go   Julia, I want to know   Julia, only the moon and stars   Julia, know just where you are   Julia"
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on..Morning finds me staring in the mirror   There's a stranger now who's looking at me   Oh, how could you let her go, just walk away?.Praising my savior   All the day long.I can hear the strobe now,   It's loud..I ain't above my raisin' and I ain't about to change..But, I'm changing fast   You'll put it all in my past   No more running around   Feel like I'm fit to be tied down."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her “budding” will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle..I'll die before I get to sleep   When screaming shadows haunt my dreams   I'm cold and soaking wet when daylight shows its face   This fear will always get in your way   And I can hear so much   That I miss it everyday   It finds me deep in love and deeper down the lane   I don't know too much but I know what I want to say   I Just Need Myself   Please leave me when you see me fall   Oh please I have to climb that wall   And from the top of it you can nearly see your face   But don't let this ever get in your way   And I can hear so much   That I miss it everyday   It finds me deep in love and deeper down the lane   I don't know too much but I know what I want to say   I Just Need Myself   I'm not going to walk on sinking sand   I'll sail this day to higher land   And when the sun is high, and I'll let my music say   These things will never get in your way   And I can hear so much   That I miss it everyday   It finds me deep in love and deeper down the lane   I don't know too much but I know what I want to say   I Just Need Myself.Joe, what do you know?.Ba-bum!.Hey baby, it's a quarter to eight   I feel I'm in the mood   Hey baby, the hour is late   I feel I've got to move      Well, hey now, baby   Said, I like your style   You really got me, baby   Way down deep inside      Oh, you drive me crazy   Baby, you're the one   I just want to rock-and-roll you woman   Until the night is gone      Hey baby, it's a quarter to eight   I feel I'm in the mood   Hey baby, the hour is late   I feel I've got to move.She says she doesn't love me,   Like-but shes acting- but its just,   If she isn't talking,   Mr. Lincoln's head is bleeding,   On a front row while she's speaking."
"It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, “This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader..When he's just as shook as you, you little snoot      Chorus 2X      Everyone come see the greatest show..I been moving   Cause they wanted me dead or alive   But I'm making a break and I want you to take a ride   Take a ride -   Bring on the night   Into the shadows and out of the light   Bring on the night   Let the dream chaser take you away      When the sun hits another horizon...   And the joker has started to deal...   You can quit if you choose but there's nothing to lose   By a spin of the wheel   Gotta burn all your bridges behind you, they'll keep dragging   You down if you stay...   And I know I ain't wrong cause I'm free and I'm on my way   On my way...   Bring on the night   Into the shadows and out of the light   Bring on the night   Let the dream chaser take you away      I live on the edge of tomorrow   I'm racing along on the wind   I can see what I need, you better believe   I'm playin' to win   I got nothin' to fear when I'm flyin....They hadn't been near me for years..Ecco ora mai, il momento temuto da tempo, sai   Gia so quello che mi dirai, e la fine di noi..Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit   And you ain't no friend of mine."
"In “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author’s purpose in concluding the story with “When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,” was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. “Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.” This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, “How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. “This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months”. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal..I ain't fooled, gettin' ready..Glass house, that once was mine , the sun will shine in on me   You, change your mind, you weren't the kind to live on me   I remember yesterday , turn my tears to laugher   Then you left and like a stray, I came running after      I remember you at night, palm trees softly swaying   I remember all the words you were softly saying      Glass house upon the hill so big and still, the shady lane   It's ours , my love , until the day we say auf wiedersehen.Bad, gonna drive you raving mad   B.A.D..Oh, can you imagine?.At first it came to me in visions   And that was filling me with pain   And when my fear became desire   To let the demon burn my soul      It said ""Don't fight in vain,""   ""I'll make you love the pain."""
"There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, “Winter Hibiscus,” in the way that she did. “Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here…” is what Saeng’s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states “…she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become…almost familiar to her now.” Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time..Yeah yeah yeah..They're trying hard to put me in my place   And that is why I gotta keep running   The future's mine and its no disgrace   'Cause in the end the past means nothing      You tell me I'm free then you tie me down   And from my chains I think it's a pity   What did it cost you to wear my crown   You don't like it so why don't you admit it      D'you feel a little down today?.We're through being cool   Eliminate the ninnies and the twits   Going to bang some heads   Going to beat some butts   Time to show those evil spuds what's what   If you live in a small town   You might meet a dozen or two   Young alien types who step out   And dare to declare   Spank the pank who try to drive you nuts   Time to clean some house   Be a man or a mouse   Waste those who make it tough to get around   If you live in a big place   Many factions underground   Chase down mister hinky dink   So no trace can be found   Put the tape on erase   Rearrange a face   We always liked Picasso anyway   Mash 'em.What we got ain't worth a cent   What we got ain't worth a damn   Someone's screwed the master plan      The pursuit of happiness   It's a common goal   The pursuit of happiness   Doing what we're told   The pursuit of happiness   To the very end   It goes 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round again      Bite the bullet in the dust   Got to take their word on thrust   No use counting down your prayers   All God's children running scared   No use howling at the moon   Planet Earth is going soon   Starving children stand on line   Living now on borrowed time      The pursuit of happiness   It's a common goal   The pursuit of happiness   Doing what we're told   The pursuit of happiness   To the very end   It goes 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round again.Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng’s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng’s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test..Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si lu bon gang-gang   Sauv?.And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear,   I want you to come on, come on to your mama now,   And if you ever want a little love of a woman   Come on and baby baby baby babe babe baby now   Cry baby yeah..Dozens of girls would storm up   I had to lock my door   Somehow I couldn't warm up   To one before      What was it that controlled me?.I just wanna talk to you   How do I say you're beautiful   When I can't take my eyes off you   I don't wanna say the wrong thing   I want just the right words to impress you   Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?.Oh, it's your secret, it's your life, who am I to criticize?"
"The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn’t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story..Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two   One of these days I'll be back with you   Counting the ways that I love you   Through and through      One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine   Tentatively you put up the signs   Letting me know you are mine      And I'm counting on you   To be here through it all   I'm counting on you   To catch me if I fall   Whatever you do, remember   I'm always counting on you      Flight six, eight, one, gate forty-two   At seven fifteen I'll feel ten feet tall   Knowing you care after all      And I'm counting on you   To be here through it all   I'm counting on you   To catch me if I fall   Whatever you do, remember   I'm always counting on you      Counting on you   To be here through it all   Counting on you   To catch me if I fall   Remember I'm always   Counting on you.Background voices calling from a distance   See no evil, hear no evil)   Static on the line of least resistance   Don't say nothing at all   Don't say nothing at all   Don't say nothing at all   I'm hanging on a wire, waitin' on the word   I'm never seen, you're never heard   The object of desire is seldom ever clear   I reach for you but all I hear   Are the background voices calling from a distance   Silent partners, listen to the hush      A lover without words is easily deceived   And rumors easily believed   The matter of obsession is seldom ever clear   I turn around, you disappear   In background voices calling from a distance   Silent partners, listen to the hush   Silent partners   You know they don't say nothing at all      What about the things we never mention?.Bacon Lot, knowumsayin'?.Lordy, lordy, Coddingtown, that's the place for me..All on her own   She's on the phone   So sincerely...

Ooh!"
"The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says “Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, “… and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. .I'mma Skype ya   I don't wanna hype ya   But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya   You ain't never have a bitch understand you   Most of them wanna use you when they ran through   I just wanna be somebody, that can add to   Your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too   I just wanna listen   When you leave I say ""damn, I fucking miss him""   I just wanna be your vixen   Give you something real wet, to put your lips in   I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you   Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure      [Hook: Jeremih]   I just wanna be your favorite   I just wanna be your favorite   I just wanna be your favorite   I just wanna be your favorite   Won't you let me be your favorite?.Man, I'm doing mine they're doing there's   So I guess It's all good   And, what about your crew?.Send lawyers, guns and money   Uhh!.biotch (biotch) I'm an All Star (chea)   26 inches sittin on the chevy frame (frame)   Top down (top down) I do the damn thang (yeeaah)   Flo-Masters got it soundin heavy from the rear (rear)   4-55 dude I'm outta here (chea)   Got my Gucci shades lookin like a rap star (star)   A buck fifty on the way call me Nascar (that's right)   Cocaine white wit the antique tags   I ain't trippin like red like gang flags (what up game)   It's Young Jeezy who the fuck wanna deal wit me (wit me)   Cashville, Tenn-A-Key, I brought a mill wit me      [Chorus]      [Verse 2: Yo Gotti]   Don't get this shit confused (fused) we was neva cool (cool)   You throwin up the North(north) but I dont know you (nope)   I'm fuckin plenty bitches (bitches) sippin plenty crisses (crisses)   You frowin up like a nigga don't supposed too   I'm mobbin wit my tools (tools) don't make me act a fool (fool)      But I'm a have to if ya homies can't control you (yup)   You steppin on my shoes (shoes) breakin all the rules (rules)   Can ya fight?.Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem   Shinning far through shadows dimmed   Giving the life for those who long have gone on   Guiding the wise men on their way   Unto the place where Jesus lay   Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on      Oh beautiful star the hope of light   Guiding the pilgrims through the night   Over the mountains 'till the break of dawn   Into the land of perfect day   It will give out a lovely ray   Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on      Oh beautiful star (beautiful, beautiful star) of Bethlehem   Star of Bethlehem   Shine upon us until the glory dawn   Give us a lamp to light the way   Unto the land of perfect day   Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on      Oh beautiful star the hope, the grace   For the redeem of good and blessed   Yonder in glory when the crowd is one   Jesus is now the star divine   Brighter and brighter he will shine   Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on      (Repeat Chorus)   Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem shine on"
"The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was “Madagascar periwinkle” in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower’s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today..She took off and left home,   She doesn't live here anymore..Oh, the moment you know it might start,   And there's no time for saying, ""No!"".And guess what?.Don't get me wrong,   I ain't the kind   To turn away from you   When something's on your mind..The immense crowd   Of clowns are now on the move all in unison moving in one direction towards   An unknown destination."
"The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng’s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn’t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did..double F.      Well, she has now gone   From this unhappy planet   With all the carnivores   And the destructors of it.Jump back, tell a friend   Ooh, la, la, la   Ooh, la, la, la   Ooh, la, la, la   I want a movie moment   We're so in love it hurts   And I'd be the main attraction   Everybody's favorite girl   Wanna be in Gucci dresses   I know you like that style   Symphony of stars to serenade us   I'm giving you my smile   Cover me with kisses   Sweet, sweet kisses   Come on over and kiss me all over   I'm gonna be here   So cover me   Run into you in slow motion   Thunder claps and pouring rain   The world is falling down around us   We didn't notice anyway   Wanna be in Gucci dresses   I know you like that style   Symphony of stars to serenade us   I'm giving you my smile   Cover me with kisses   Sweet, sweet kisses   Come on over and kiss me all over   I'm gonna be here   Cover me with kisses   Sweet, sweet kisses   Come on over and kiss me all over   My love is for real   Come on, come on, cover me baby   Come on, come on, cover me baby   Come on, come on, cover me baby   Come on, come on, cover me baby   Come on, come on, cover me baby   Come on, come on, cover me baby   Come on, come on, cover me baby   Come on, come on, cover me baby   Cover me with kisses   Sweet, sweet kisses   Come on over and kiss me all over   I'm gonna be here   Cover me with kisses   Sweet, sweet kisses   Come on over and kiss me all over   My love is for real.I got to keep running now   Bell Boy!.Ring a ding ding..He said: ""I ain't tryin' to shake you up, but I just want you to know      If the cops start to crowding me in   You're gonna be the first to go!"
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again..Cause it truly, loosely, he knows how to make me feel like a lady   I'm sneaking out the night cause he drives me crazy   He knows how to make me sweat!.[Dedicated to A.

"She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring..Jen!.I need a map of your head   Translated into English   So I can learn not to make you frown   You'd feel better if you'd vent   Put your frustrations into four letter words   And let them out on mine   The most weathered ears in town      So say what you will   Say what you mean   You could never offend   Your dirty words come out clean.But I can't find my way home..Momma may have,   Poppa may have,   But God bless the child   That's got his own,   That's got his own....But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured,   Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors."
"In the story, “winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story she vows,” In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home..I wish that it could be like that   Why can't it be like that?.Jesus commands us to go,      It should be the exception if we stay..these same people who deplore th   El of current popular songs and yet will sit around enthralled singing jimmy crack corn and I don't care or green grow the rushes, oh!.How can't I make mistakes,   I dunno whats up with you..And I don't know why, I let that mean woman make me a fool."
"The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample “But it’s strong enough to make it through winter”, says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself “Then i will take the test again.”     .This is ""T"" to the mother fucking ""Ofty""   What's you're problem Dickhead      [1st Verse]      Don't kick my dog dickhead   Don't beep at me dickhead   Why d'you mug me off in my car dickhead   Why you disrespecting my bra dickhead   There's a dickhead in you're mouth   A dickhead on parade   Do not have kids   Don't want dickheads to be made dickhead   Why you disrespecting my bra dickhead   Why d'you piss me off in first class dickhead   I'm not sitting here to be treated like a dickhead   Bumba Clart, kin' Raas Clart   Where's the Chorus dickhead      [Chorus:]      Isn't it Lovely, that we can still be good friends   They say you've gone off me, don't be so sloppy..

" The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng’s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother ‘s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn’t  home she said “ I failed the test .” This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn’t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal..Honey, just allow me one more chance,   Ah'll do anything with you..Big boss man   Can't you hear me when I call?.And Romancing..Oh!).A tatooed madman, I'm hell on wheels   Born a wicked child left alone in the fields   My father was the wind, my mother was fire   Raised by the wolves and I grew up wild   A kamakazi man, a hollering 'Banzai'   Never crash and burn, never gonna die   ya cannibal it's me, ya scream and shout   I'll chew ya up and spit ya out      Storms i gotcha comin and its gonna be me."
"By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return From their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready..Soul   I dropped by to pick up a reason   For the thought that I caught that my head   Was the event of the season   Why in crowds   Just a trace of my face   Could seem so pleasin'   I'll cop out to the change   But a stranger is putting the tease on      I was down on the ground   When the messenger   Wrote me a letter   I was raised by the praise of a fan   Who said I upset her   Any girl in the world   Could have easily known me much better   She said   You're strange, but don't change   And I let her   In a while when the smile on my face   Turned to plaster   Stick around while the clown who gets sick   Does the trick of disaster   For the race of my head and my face   Is moving much faster      Is it strange I should change   I don't know   Why don't you ask her   Is it strange I should change      I don't know, why don't you ask her   Is it strange I should change   I don't know, why don't you ask her   Is it strange I should change      Why don't you ask her      [Fade out].I got my head down between my knees   I got my back against this bedroom wall   I hear my voice saying baby please   But I know you don't hear me call      You're staring at that far horizon   I don't even know why you stay   It's like you're already miles and miles away      We got this life so far turned around   We only talk about what happened last   We try to move ahead but we're losing ground   To the heartache and the pain of the past      Staring at that far horizon   I don't even know why I stay   You're already miles and miles away..Gonna have a little girl   A little boy   A little engy we call Leroy   But no one needs to know   Right now..It's travelin' time and I must move on..Feel the rush of the ocean."
"The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that..After all these years   I find I'm OK by myself   And I don't need you   Or your homespun philosophy   No, no, no, no      This might make you throw up in your bed   I'm o.k..Up underneath the her clothesline..She dips the feather in his blood   Writes herself so many lines   A lifeless letter from her childhood   As her father slept by her side      What (animal) do you do?.This time he's gonna wear an iron suit   This time she's gonna fix her heart and make it bullet proof   He says he's gonna take a bite from the forbidden fruit   She says never never bite more than you can chew   But this time he's not gonna be another could've been   This time she's gonna get real, love the skin she's in   She says a winner never quits, quitters never win   She said this time that she is built to face anything   This time he's gonna step for who he is   This time she's gonna live to work, she's not working to live   He says just because you say it's true, it don't mean it is   She says it seems too good to be true, well then it probably is   This time he's hell bent yeah he's heaven bound   This time she's gonna pick herself up no more breaking down   He says he's gonna turn the wheel, turn this shit around   She says if he's looking for love then she don't want to be found      When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow   It's so hard to keep yourself on the straight and narrow   When you shoot across the sky like a broken arrow   It's all I've got   Yeah when you hit the ground   It's hard to get to heaven when your falling hell bound      This time he's gonna make it to the aftermath   This time she's gonna raise her head choose the righteous path   He said one day we will look back and it will make us laugh   She said better to have and not need, than to need and not have   No matter what the cause it's better to have loved and lost   Have you ever met a man who never loved at all?.It's all my fault, could have told you."
"The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng “comfort in her time of discomfort.” She would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of that she fail test the first time because she was comfortable with being in a new place. But when spring comes, she’ll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding..Could you think for yourself and go on?.Throw your homework onto the fire   Come out and find the one that you love   Come out and find the one you love.Chorus   With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,   Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,   But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,   And there's no salvation to be found..I feel like bein' jive, hangin' out, maybe go to Mexico..Once you let someone love you   You'll find an open door   A place in your heart you've never been before   (Believe it's never too late) never too late   (For someone to set you free)set you free      (Someone love you) someone love you   Won't you let someone love you   (Someone love you)   (Someone love you)"
"The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring..You want to love with me, love with me then,      I only ask that you still be my friend,      For there are many where friendship's unknown,      They live together, but really alone..Yeah, you can be the greatest   You can be the best   You can be the King Kong banging on your chest      You can beat the world   You can beat the war   You can talk to God, go banging on his door      You can throw your hands up   You can beat the clock (yeah)   You can move a mountain   You can break rocks   You can be a master   Don't wait for luck   Dedicate yourself and you gon' find yourself      Standing in the hall of fame (yeah)   And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)   'Cause you burn with the brightest flame (yeah)   And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)   And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame      You can go the distance   You can run the mile   You can walk straight through hell with a smile      You can be the hero   You can get the gold   Breaking all the records they thought never could be broke      Yeah, do it for your people   Do it for your pride   How are you ever gonna know if you never even try?.Perfect by nature   Icons of self indulgence   Just what we all need   More lies about a world that      Never was and never will be   Have you no shame don't you see me   You know you've got everybody fooled      Look here she comes now   Bow down and stare in wonder   Oh how we love you   No flaws when you're pretending   But now I know she      Never was and never will be   You don't know how you've betrayed me   And somehow you've got everybody fooled      Without the mask where will you hide   Can't find yourself lost in your lie      I know the truth now   I know who you are   And I don't love you anymore      Never was and never will be   You don't know how you've betrayed me   And somehow you have everybody fooled      It never was and never will be   You're not real and you can't save me   Somehow now you're everybody's fool.Look out, here comes tomorrow   That's when I'll have to choose   How I wish I could borrow   Someone else's shoes      Mary, oh what a sweet girl   Lips like strawberry pie   Sandra, the long hair and pig tails   Can't make up my mind   I see all kinds of sorrow   Wish I loved only one   Look out here comes tomorrow   Oh how I wish   Tomorrow would never come      Told them both that I loved them   Said it, and it was true   But I can't have both of them   Don't know what to do      I see all kinds of sorrow   Wish I loved only one   Look out here comes tomorrow   Oh how I wish   Tomorrow would never come      [Instrumental]      I see all kinds of sorrow   Wish I loved only one   Look out here comes tomorrow   Oh how I wish   Tomorrow would never come   Covered by The Monkees and other artists.Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon,   Ill blame it on the nights that could not be,   But, my heart blames it on me."
" He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants..Dirty Harry, you look really scary   With your .357, officer Kevin   Spent 11 years on the force trying to get mine   Head got the flat top, boots got the spit shine   Don't give a fuck about my neighborhood   Just wanna do your eight hours, then hit the showers   Shoot a brother down adn you don't send flowers   Goddamn sherrif, can't wait to tarriff   A chunk of a nigga ass, but watch a nigga blast   And get away nigga fast   You ain't gonna have me face down no more   You ain't gonna have a chance to clown no more   To the boys in blue, I got kids too   Ain't going out like a jigaboo, no no no   On my way to the store   You see me in a Range Rover, now you gotta pull me over   But where oh where is the ticket?.Well I'm looking for my face   And I got no place to go      I said, ""Oh no, doncha follow me no more."".Sometimes at night I lay awake,   Just to watch you sleep, hear each breath you take..(guitar solo)      Oh I'm playing in a travelling band   Playing in a travelling band   Won't you get me, take me hand   Well I'm playing in a travelling band   Well I'm flying across the land   Trying to get a hand   Playing in a travelling band, oh-wow!.Sweet home Kokomo      Go on down to the river, baby   Goin' to sit down on the ground   Well, I'm goin' down to the river, baby   Goin' to sit down on the ground   And let the way of the water   Lord, Honey, wash my troubles down      Kokomo me, baby   Kokomo me right   Kokomo your mama   She'll be back tomorrow night   I gotta cry with you, baby   Baby, don't you want to go   Right on to Lemon Light City   Sweet home Kokomo?"
"The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng..Do you dream?.Well I think it's time to get ready   To realize just what I found   I have lived unaware of what I am   It's all clear to me now, that      My heart is on fire   My soul's like a wheel that's turning   My love is alive, my love is alive      Well there's something inside   That's makin' me crazy   Tryin' to keep it together   Cause what I'm saying, I have been saving   And now could be forever      My love is alive, my heart's on fire   Soul is like a wheel, like a hot wire   My love is alive, my heart's on fire   Soul's like a wheel, like a hot wire      There's a mirror inside my mind   Reflectin' the light that shines on me   Hold on to the feeling   Let it be, let it grow   My heart is on fire, my love is alive      Fire in my heart, soul's like a wheel that's turning   My love is alive.When the curtain calls   Oh baby, what's a boy to do?.Whoever you are   Beat my mother down, all I see is scars   And memories - what about me?.She use to be my rosa amarilla   My little Mexicali tomatilla   But then one night I drank too much sangria   Woke up and found a note that said I'll see ya      (Chorus)   Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more   My baby no esta aqui no more   She left me here with nada   Broke my heart like a pinata   My baby no esta aqui no more      Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her   Please, please tell her that I need her      I used to be her number one vaquero   Her numero uno caballero   But I've had to hock my spurs and my sombrero   'Cause when she left she took all my dinero      (Repeat Chorus)      Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her   Please, please tell her that I need her      Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more   My baby no esta aqui no more   she left me here with nada   Broke my heart like a pinata   My baby no esta aqui   My baby no esta aqui   My baby no esta aqui no more"
"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. “ ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng..At this time I would like to introduce a friend of ours,   a very talented guy named John Sebastian..Skin moves towards malignant   Worshiping the sun..Won't need no shadow man   Runnin the government   Won't need no stinkin' WAR   Won't need no haircut   Won't need no shoe shine   After the garden is gone   After the garden is gone   After the garden is gone      What will people do?.I want to do all I can, just to show you..Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you   Embrace me, you irreplaceable you   Just one look at you   My heart grew tipsy in me   You and you alone   Bring out the gypsy in me      I love all the many charms about you   Above all, I want these arms about you      Don't be a naughty baby   Come to papa, come to papa do   My sweet embraceable you      I love all the many charms about you   Above all, I want my arms about you      So don't you be, a naughty baby   Come to papa do   My sweet embraceable you"
"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus”. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says “In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again”. This shows Saeng’s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng’s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here....I can't stop this feeling   Deep inside of me   Girl, you just don't realize   What you do to me      Your lips are sweet as candy   The taste stays on my mind   You just keep me thirsty   For another cup of wine      When you hold me   In your arms so tight   You let me know   Everything's all right      I, I'm hooked on a feeling   I'm high on believing   That you're in love with me      I've got it bad for you, darling   But I don't need a cure   I'll just stay addicted   And hope I can endure      All the good love   When we're all alone   Keep it up boy   Yeah, you turn me on      I, I'm hooked on a feeling   I'm high on believing   That you're in love with me      When you hold me   In your arms so tight   You let me know   Everything's all right      I, I'm hooked on a feeling   I'm high on believing   That you're in love with me      I said I'm hooked on a feeling.Your enemies stay far from you   And they don't....Especially for the young!.Bucking broncs, yeah, sipping wine,   You got to see him go,   And all the ten-gallon girls   Love to hear him yodel ""Ay-hee-ho!"""
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with, “When they come back take that test again. “She does this to show that she still has hope, and won’t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. “@CAPS1 I will take that test again.” (shows hope).”And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  .I suck information through the holes in my skull   As my belly gurgles hungry my mouth is always full..Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth   One more thin gypsy thief   Well I see Jane's awake      She sends her regards..I know a man we call him poor boy Jones   He's never been a 100 miles from home   He's got a pretty good farm   And a level head   A heart of gold      No satellite dish for his TV set   And he ain't on lie with the internet   He says guitar music entertains us here   and it sounds real good to the untrained ear      And I can't find a rason to echange   More of this and more of that   Has never been my game   The way I've got it figured out   I ain't missed a thing   And I can't find a reason to change      Some people like to fly around first class   But a greyhound bus goes pretty dang fast   Been a while lot of times when time were lean   A big night out was a Dairy Queen   He says all my children believe in god   They can hold their own   They can hold a job   There's a whole lot of color in the human race   And loving one another makes a better place      And I can't find a reason to exchange   More of this and more of that   Has never been my game   The way I've got it figured out   I ain't missed a thing   And I can't find a reason to change   No, I can't find a reason to change.Can't take my eyes off you..He is such a sick little man   He's so much sicker than me, and I am      Meet me at midnight by the cemetery gates   Meet me at midnight or your Lucy will be dead      McKenzie did you hear me?...No Lucy, she is fine   She's sleeping in her coffin   Can't wait to meet your face again      He is such a sick little man   He's so much sicker than me, and I am      Meet me at midnight by the cemetery gates   Meet me at midnight or your Lucy will be dead"
"I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is “almost familiar to her now” (@NUM1)..And I miss you like hell   And I'm feeling blue      Wish you were here   Me oh my country man   Wish you were here   (Wish you were here)      Wish you were here   Don't you know the snow is getting colder?.You talk about me as if I'm not there   You don't even whisper 'cause you just don't care   I stand there and listen to my life go by   And at times I wonder why I even try      Well I try because I like to finish what I start   And I have faith it can get better tomorrow   But it won't if you keep treating me   Like I'm invisible      Say that you won't treat me   The way you're treating me   Say that you won't   I see you but you just keep looking right through me   Like someone you don't even see   Like I'm invisible      You brag to your friends how much I must want ya   You said I was someone you could do with or without   You're so confident that I'd never leave you   No wonder you're surprised that I am walking out      Well, I have to leave no matter how sad it might be   Because this hurt's become my reality   And I won't let you keep on treating me   Like I'm invisible      Say that you won't treat me   The way you're treating me   Say that you won't   I see you but you just keep looking right through me   Like someone you don't even see   Like I'm invisible      Well I finally got the nerve to move on   'cause a fly kind of guy like me   Surely deserves more, much more   My new love can see what's inside of me   And she told me to thank you   For the good love that you blew, and oh      I wish you could see the way she looks at me   She don't keep me insecure or treat me lovelessly   She don't hide me from her friends when we have company   And she never ever makes me feel   Like I'm invisible      And after we lay here, she wants me to stay here   I'm not just for making love then expected to leave   I'm not only someone used for helping her ends meet   And she'd never ever walk on by me   Like I'm invisible      Like I'm invisible.Minsan dalawang puso'y   Nagsumpaan pag-big nawalang hanggan   Sumpang kastiyong buhangin pala   Pag-ibig na pagsamantala   (Repeat Refrain, III)   Minsan dalawang puso'y   Nagsumpaan pag-big nawalang hanggan   Sumpang kastiyong buhangin pala   Pansamantala, luha ang dala   'Yan ang pag-ibig na nangyari sa atin   Gumuhong kastiyong buhangin......Can you stop the pain?.Walking and talking   Dancing 'till dawn      Insomnia   Waiting to get you   Insomnia   Waiting to get you."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test..Chorus:   Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...   ...

"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it..I don't want to watch no porno,   And I don't want to play guitar,   I don't want to spank the monkey,   I don't want to go down to the corner bar,   And I ain't even got to listen   To all the stupid shit you got to say..White, white ashes, building crashes down..Blest are they who smile from bodies free,   Seems to me like any other crowd   Who are waiting to be saved..D.C. why y'all!.(I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)   (I truly believe, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do)"
"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng’s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says “vowed” to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become… familiar.” The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time..Yeah I'm wit you nigga c'mon   Alright then nigga lets make it happen then   All you motherfuckers get on the fuckin floor!.I sit around and sadly mumble..You're too much..I was caught between the years   Cost me nearly all my tears   With my back turned looking down the path      Hit me like a ton of bricks   Had to have my outlook fixed   With my back turned looking down the path      People always ask me why   What's the matter with me?.Woah, Woah   What's new pussycat ?"
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line “.. Slowly fading into the distance.” Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line “… Through the quiet repition of season upon season.”.

" The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change. The snow is melting represents change from cold to warm. The geese returning represents a new life as in coming back to something semi–new. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The hibiscus is budding represents growth.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphisise the theme that changes in life are hard to adjust to. Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home. The flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight to Saeng's character. We now know that eventhough it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and love, she will have the strength to make it in a new world.?.If I had wings   Like Noah's dove   I'd fly   Across the water   To that man I love   Fare you well   Oh, honey   Fare you well      One of these mornings   In the drizzling rain   All around my heart   Was an aching pain   Fare you well   Oh, honey   Fare you well      If I had listened   To what my mama said   I'd of stayed at home   In momma's bed   Fare you well   Oh, honey   Fare you well   Fare you well   Oh, honey   Fare you well      One of these mornings   It won't be long   You'll call my name   And I'll be gone   Fare you well   Fare you well   Fare you well.You woke me up from this long and endless sleep..Got a message in my head   That the papers had all gone   Richard Manuel is dead   And the daylight's coming on   I've been wandering through the dark   Now I'm standing on the lawn      If I could give all my love to you   I could justify myself   But I'm just not coming through   You're a pill to ease the pain   Of all the stupid things I do   I'm an anchor on the line   Of a clock that tells the time   That is running out on you   Well it was cold when I woke   And the day was halfway done   Nearly spring in San Francisco   But I cannot feel the sun   You were sleeping next to me   But I knew that you'd be gone      If I could give all my love to you   I could justify myself   But I'm just not coming through   You're a pill to ease the pain   Of all the stupid things I do   I'm an anchor on the line   Of a clock that tells the time   That is running out on you   Take some time before you go   Think of monday's coming down   And the people that you knew   The ones that aren't around   You've been fading day to day   I've been moving town to town      If I could give all my love to you   I could justify myself   But I'm just not coming through   You're a pill to ease the pain   Of all the stupid things I do   I'm an anchor on the line   Of a clock that tells the time   That is running out on you   2X.Couple in the next room   bound to win a prize:   they've been going at it all night long!.Where have I gone wrong?"
"Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. “when the snow melts and the geese return” This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons.

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won’t stop until they are in the south for winter. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal..The joy of a toy      Put the hurt into action..and I'm dreaming again ..What you going to do when the walls come down   When the searchlights flash and the sirens sound   If your name is called will you be around   Will you keep a' rolling   Where you going to hide when they look for you   Will you march in time, will you see it through   Make me proud, the least you can do   Wheelz will keep us rolling      Now to a fault can I speak the name   From where we go and whence we came   Standing tall to share the blame   Time only knows tolling   Count out the scars, that pollute the mind   Where the critics lay and the enemy find   They find, no one   We are burning more than just a moment      Wheelz to the moment that takes us where we are   Wheelz to the volunteer that's gone too far   Wheelz to the few we love, our loyalty and trust   Wheelz to our moment, the best of us      When the price is high and betrayal ripe   Would you rather run, or will you stay and fight   Will you give me hope, will you give me light   You have to keep me rolling   And if I fall, right next to you   Will you lift me up, will you see me through   You know I'd do the same for you   You have to keep me rolling      Where you going to stand, when the bastards drool   When the bitches cry, in the line of fools   Will you give me strength, so I can too   Never stop the rolling   I am honored to have known your name   So proud I am that you feel the same   As we go from whence we came, rolling   We are burning more than just the moment   We are living more than in a moment      Wheelz to the moment that takes us where we are   Wheelz to the volunteer that's gone too far   Wheelz to the few we love, our loyalty and trust   Wheelz to our moment, the best of us      Take up arms, stand in a line   Listen to the march that takes you through time   Find what you need in the sound of the drum   And feel in your heart, what only few have done      Wheelz to the moment that takes us where we are   Wheelz to the volunteer that's gone too far   Wheelz to the few we love, our loyalty and trust   Wheelz to our moment, the best of us      The best of us.Yeah, watch the world die   Yeah, yeah watch the world die   Wooah, yeah, watch the world die   Yeah watch the world die.Yuko awezayo kusikia kilio chetu?"
"Thes Author, In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the habiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng knew seeing the flower again will make her cry, will make her memories come back, she will be re tested..God she'd his grace on thee   And crown thy good with brotherhood   From sea to shining sea!.A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,   And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,   And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,   Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour..We're 'gonna make plans for eternity..Go away and never come back!.Oh, can you feel my heart?"
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better. As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass..(manny charlton)   Publishing copyright: elgin music   Copyright 1986 nazareth (dunfermline) ltd., dunfermline.Solitary brother,   Is there still a part of you that wants to live?.Right   Sure the angels know how to fly   Knows that I will   Be standing here regardless   Hey yo, ey,      I can't picture ever more   Don't know what it looks life   But girl if I know nothing at all   I know if you're not there   I'm not going regardless   Life is scary sometimes   And the dark leaves you blind   But when you.If you put me to the test, if you let me try..All that's missing is the sea,   But don't worry, you can suntan!"
"The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng She is a teenager her family just moved to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng failed her driving test and on the walk home discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus she falls in love with the Hibiscus. Saeng's mother has a garden she is always planting things a using plarts a veggies from her garden for dinner. The author conclude a paragraph that says where the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring Saeng with take the test again. I think Saeng says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants When she passes the test and she thinks seeing th Hibiscus will help her passthe driving test..and hight tension wire (?).Play it like ya really bad   Tired      Can I interest you in nothin'?.Oh no, it's true   I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do   Oh no, it's kinda strange   I'm the last sensitive cowboy on   Oh no, it's true   I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do   Oh no, it's kinda strange   I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range.They try to bring me down, but I won't stop..I'm not asking your heart to believe me."
" I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home..What I feel, what I know, what I hear   It's over!.Dashing through the snow   In a one horse open sleigh   O'er the fields we go   Laughing all the way   Bells in bobtails ring   Making spirits bright   What fun it is to ride and sing   A sleighing song tonight   Jingle bells   Jingle bells   Jingle all the way   Oh what fun it is to ride   In a one horse open sleigh   Jingle bells   Jingle bells   Jingle all the way   Oh what fun it is to ride   In a one horse open sleigh.I was dumb enough not to settle down when you wanted to   Now I'm sittin' here going crazy trying to crawl back to you   Mary, Mary, why you want to do me this way?.[Verse 1]   My life is a movie and everyone's watching   So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense      [Pre-Chorus]   Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing   When the pressure's coming down like lightning   It's like they want me to be perfect   When they don't even know that I'm hurting      [Chorus]   Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel   Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real   Act like you know me, but you never will   There's one thing that I know for sure   I'll show you   I'll show you   I'll show you   I'll show you      [Verse 2]   I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way   Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say      [Pre-Chorus]   Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing   When the pressure's coming down like lightning   It's like they want me to be perfect   When they don't even know that I'm hurting      [Chorus]   Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel   Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real   Act like you know me, but you never will   There's one thing that I know for sure   I'll show you   I'll show you   I'll show you   I'll show you   Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel   Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real   Act like you know me, but you never will   There's one thing that I know for sure      [Outro: Acoustic]   I'll show you   I'll show you.Essentially, people in this world just wanna let it be."
"The author ended the story “Winter Hibiscus” with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes..Settle down, don't settle down without me, no, no   Settle down, I'll settle down for good, yeah   Settle down, I'll settle down around you, yeah, yeah   Settle down, I'll settle down for sure, yeah      Whatever I can do, I will   'Cause I'm good like that   For seven years, seven days, and seven hours   I took my chances, yeah   Whatever I can do, I will   'Cause I want      Never lose that feeling   Never lose that feeling      Settle down, I'll settle down around you, yeah, yeah   Settle down, I'll settle down for good, yeah   Settle down, don't settle down without me, no, no   Settle down, I'll settle down for sure, yeah      Never lose that feeling   Never, no, no   Never lose your feelings   Never, that's for sure      Never lose that feeling   Never lose that feeling   Never lose that feeling   Never lose that feeling   Never lose that feeling   Never lose that feeling      Whatever I can do, I will   'Cause I want to, and what I want I get   Seven years, seven days, and seven hours   I took my chances, yeah      Settle down, don't settle down without me, no, no   Settle down, I'll settle down for good, yeah   Settle down, I'll settle down around you, yeah, yeah   Settle down, I'll settle down for sure, yeah      Never lose that feeling   Never, no, no, no.My mind was racin' I was pacin'   But the words just would'nt come   And there was only one thing left to do   I feel it coming on      [Chorus]      Some days you gotta dance   You gotta loosen up those chains and dance   You gotta loosen up those chains and dance.I'm watchin' the skaters   Fly by on the lake..I'm doing very well   I can block out the present and the past now   I know by now you think I should have   Straightened myself out - Thank you, drop dead!.Ah, well perhaps you can use a gift yourself?"
"The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that “never giving up is important” is presented and carried out hopefully through the character’s vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard..The end.....[Verse 2]   What would you wish if you saw a shooting star,   In an ordinary world?.Now and later, I don't wanna have to wait, you the one..Then ever, ever praise we   His power and glory-why, ever more proclaim   His power and glor-or-ory-why, ever more-ore-ore proclaim...      Oh-oh..., oh-oh..., oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh...   Oh-oh..., oh-oh... [fade].Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
" The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn’t like the change and would like to go back to her old home.Vo-dee-o-do..Shoot them in the back, I shoot them in the back      I'm going down, I'm going downtown   I'm going down, down, down.The winter's getting colder, summer's getting hotter   Wishin' well's wishin' for another drop of water..And the joint been jumpin' when the band been pumpin'   And you know they're playing crazy gigs..Mary, did you know   Your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?"
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn’t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, “I-I failed the test.” When she says “the test” she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, “When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces..You can't hold me!).It was a Friday morning, I was really boring   I wish it was night, a struggle and a fight   When I saw her there was a good affair   She's so nice, she's so cool, I don't think she's a fool   When I saw her last time, was a day at school   But at school it isn't fine, yeah the school isn't cool   I was drunken that night, without thinking about   I was really gone 'cause we had much fun      Without thinking about, I went go more far   I was really almost, knocked down by a car      Chorus 2X:   I would take her, I would find her, she's my target   The way I want her, and her money, that's sounds funny      I hope her friends like me, or do they hate me   My friends don't like her, but I really don't care   She is more important, than my stupid friends   They can say what they want to, ''just do what you want to! ''.Why must I be the thief?.I think you wanna...Ref (3x)"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not disappointed about failing is anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year.  .As the days fly past will we lose our grasp   Or fuse it in the sun?.I've been waiting so long   To be where I'm going   In the sunshine of your love..You push too hard   You push too hard   Come closer and talk to me      You push too hard   You push too hard   D'you get the picture now?.Work, it can work..Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye   Oh no one else could take her place in my life   Oh we had something good   So tell me why she would   Go and make me cry   Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye      I remember how she'd hold me   And say she'd stay forever true   Back when the future looked so rosy   But tonight it's lookin' mighty blue      Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye   Oh no one else could take her place in my life   Oh we had something good   So tell me why she would   Go and make me cry   Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye      Don't know what I didn't give her   That she gets from someone new   I only know how much I miss her   And wish my heart was only broke in two      Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye   Oh no one else could take her place in my life   Oh we had something good   So tell me why she would   Go and make me cry   Oh me, oh my   Why did she go and make me cry   Oh me, oh my sweet baby said goodbye"
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, “she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again..All's I gots is time -- Got no meaning, just a rhyme..Empty, where my heart used to be   Now I'm looking in the mirror, I see this monster that is me.Cause I need more time   And I need an excuse      I'm a thief, a liar   An angel in the fire   I'm a king, a drug   The push that comes to shove   I'm a freak, a star   I'm everything you are   I'm your Jesus, I'm your pride      We're made to heal      I depend on you   For the wings of life   And the air that you move   And I defended you   For this one last time   For the nerves you abuse..They ask me where the hell I'm going?.[Verse:]   I was at the mall on some back to school   Tryna cop me a couple pairs of shoes   And then I looked to my left   And I lost my breath 'cause this girl was so fresh   Really wasn't tryna intrude   But she looked like the type I was into   And I wanted to holla but she was wit her mama   Felt like a catch 22   Okay how should I step to her, (how should I step to her)   Without any disrespect to her   But I thought she would like   If I kept it polite   So I stepped and this is what I said to her      [Chorus:]   Excuse me mamma (hey)   Your daughters fine (your daughter's fine)   And If I could I'd like a moment of her time (a moment of her time)   While I was shopping I saw her walking by   So can I get her number and I'll give her mine?"
"The story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing “when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough. That’s what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus..He came dancing across the water   With his galleons and guns   Looking for a new world   And a palace in the sun      And on the shore lay montezuma   With it's coca leaves and pearls   In his halls he often wondered   With the secrets of the world      And the subjects gathered round him   Like the leaves around the trees   His coat of many colors   For the angry gods to see      And the women all were beautiful   And the men stood straight and strong   He offered life with sacrifice   So that others might go on      Yeah      Now hate was just a legend   And war was never known   The people worked together   And they lifted many stones      And they carried them across the flatland   But they died along the way   (many lives were lost)   Built up with their bare hands   What we still can't do today   (many lives were lost)      And I know she's living there   And loves me to this day   I can't remember when   Or how I lost my way   Ah-oh   Ah-oh   Ah-oh   Ah-oh      He came dancing across the water   Cortez, cortez   What a killer.But for right now they're both in love   The only thing they're thinkin' of   Is that they're finally where their hearts have always been..And that old beat up car we dated in, finally turned to rust..You gotta roll with it   You gotta take your time   You gotta say what you say   Don't let anybody get in your way   'Cause it's all too much   For me to take      Don't ever stand aside   Don't ever be denied   You ought to be who you be   If you're coming with me      I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside   I think I'm gonna take me away and hide   I'm thinking things that I just can't abide   I know the roads on which your life will drive      I find the key that lets you slip inside   Kiss the girl she's not behind the door   Do you know I think I recognize your face   But I've never seen you before      [Chorus]      I know the roads on which your life will drive   I find the key that lets you slip inside   Kiss the girl she's not behind the door   Do you know I think I recognize your face   But I've never seen you before      [Chorus]      Don't ever stand aside   Don't ever be denied   You ought to be who you be   If you're coming with me      I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside [Repeat: x 8].When bells ring out the summer free   Oh baby doll   Will it end for you and me?"
"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng saying “when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending. The rest of the story is and sad because saeng misses her home in Vietnam. ""Its – it’s not a real one. I mean, it’s not like the kind we had at – at – she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before."" The end sends the message that even though things are different than before, she won’t give up trying to make a good life in the United States and not let this change affect her .Before you know the crime it's all too late..Romance me...dance me   'til I don't care   You haven't lived until you've danced on air   Whisper nothings if you dare   Won't you please, be my Fred Astaire      (Jam):   Everybody up...everybody up   Everybody up on the dance floor now   Everybody up...everybody up   Everybody up on the dance floor now      I know they call you Mr. Lonely Heart   But you're the leading man to play the part   You don't have to be a millionaire   All you have to do is be my Fred Astaire      (Chorus):   Get up now...get up now   Get up now...be my Fred Astaire (x2)      (Jam):   When you move it's like a melody   Serenading...the very heart of me   I'll be your Ginger Rogers on the floor   Swirl me..Till you execpt it with grace when your true love doesn't last..We're like crystal   (Hey)   We break easy   (Hoo)   I'm a poor man   (Hey)   If you leave me   (Hoo)   I'm applauded   (Hey)   Then forgotten   It was summer   (Hey)   Now it's autumn   (Hoo)   I don't know what to say   You don't care anyway   I'm a man in a rage   With a girl I betrayed   Here comes love   It's like honey   You can't buy it with money   You shook me to the core   You shook me to the core      (Hoo, hey)   We're like crystal   (Hey)   It's not easy   (Hoo)   With your love   (Hey)   You could feed me   (Hoo)   Every man   (Hey)   And every woman   (Hoo)   Needs someone   (Hey)   So keep it coming   Keep it coming   Keep it coming   Keep it coming   Keep it coming   Keep it coming      I don't know what to say   You don't care anyway   I'm a man in a rage   With a girl I betrayed   Here comes love   It's like honey   You can't buy it with money   You're not alone anymore   You shook me to the core   You shook me to the core      I don't know what to say   You don't care anyway   I'm a man in a rage   With a girl I betrayed   Here comes love   It's like honey   You can't buy it with money   You're not alone anymore   You shook me to the core   You shook me to the core   You shook me to the core   You shook me to the core      Keep it coming   Keep it coming   Keep it coming   Keep it coming   Keep it coming.Yeah, and I'll shave mine   I don't like the things you try to make me do   And I don't need you   I don't need you      I don't need you to tell me what to wear   You can say that I don't care, it's true   I don't need you to tell me how to speak   I won't become some kind of geek like you      Just to hear you talk you'd think the world revolves 'round what you've got to say   Now you can give me trouble but I'm going to give it back to you some day      You don't like my face   No you look just fine   I don't know my place   No you're out of line   Should I shave off my hair?"
" In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again..Turning a new leaf   Turning a new leaf   Turning a new leaf      Street wise, cat's eye's   Show business smile   Lookin' for today's mark   On the golden mile   Book wise, movie eyed   So cool dudes..Hoping for a new beginning   To take me away from my surroundings   So I can finally say goodbye   Wondering what'll become of us   When we are all old and gray   And this time that we've spent together   Was well worth our wait   Think of the fun that we had   Not caring until the next morning   It feels so good to go through life   With your eyes half open      We are all one and the same   We are lovers, and brothers, and sisters   And most of all friends      These years have passed us by so fast   It seems like we never got the chance   To realize how good life really was   And let the moment last   And it feels like it was only yesterday   When we walked into this place   And said I can't wait till I get out of here   And now as we walk down this aisle   With four years all rolled up in a scroll, you can't help but think   Hey, Where did the time go      We are all one and the same   We are lovers, and brothers, and sisters   And most of all friends   Hold on to your memories   Hold on to those little things   And I hope you receive as much as you get   Cause when you die they're the only things   That you can take to your grave      These are the days of your life   And don't let them pass you by   Cause you never know when you might take your last breath   And so take a deep one tonight      Good friends we had along the way   And good friends that didn't make it to where we stand today   But we all know that they're looking down on us   And even though their lives were cut short   We still remember the little thing that made us laugh about them   And do you remember when and where did you meet them?.""Oh, I prefer absence,"" said she,   ""My heart grows fonder alone."".There must be another way to say goodbye.That's when Homo sapiens,   Starts to emerge."
"The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant..Chorus      There we lay till the break of the day   And divil the one did hear us   There we lay till the break of the day   And divil the one did hear us   She arose and put on her clothes   Saying ""Darling, you must leave me."".Crazy, crazy   Crazy fool   Cra--zy fool      If she thinks that she   Gonna dispose my world   Gotta-be-a crazy, crazy, crazy,   Crazy fool   Cra--zy fool      My love for you,   Was oh, so strong   We went together,   For oh, so long      I might have complained about this misery, yeah   Is this the way,   Love's supposed to be?.S' what I love to see!.Ev'rything's gonna be alright now..Drink blood."
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus,” the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She says that she will try again. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up..fly high over the see   There's a little girl who's waiting for me   Love her till my dying day   And when I die you'll hear me say   I love that girl for eternity   But I gotta get the first plane home   I gotta get the first plane home   Got to wing wing[?].Ricky's been kicking the gong, lickity-split, didn't take too long..Wear a uniform   All on a government loan   I'm worth a million in prizes   Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the   Sidewalk - no more beating my brains   With the liquor and drugs   With the liquor and drugs   Well I am just a modern guy   Of course I've had it in the ear before   'Cause of a lust for life   'Cause of a lust for life   I got a lust for life   Got a lust for life   Oh a lust for life   Oh a lust for life   A lust for life   I got a lust for life   I got a lust for life   Well I am just a modern guy   Of course I've had it in the ear before   'Cause of a lust for life   'Cause of a lust for life   'Cause of a lust for life   Here comes Johnny Yen again   With the liquor and drugs   And the flesh machine   He's gonna do another striptease   Hey man where'd you get   That lotion?.And out of state you're so hot, Juggalos reach   (Juggalos reach)   And what about the Bronco Bowl in Deep Ellem?.How deep is the red??"
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by: Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is try to adjust to @LOCATION1 coming from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes “saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain..Didn't sleep a wink last night,   'Cause you walked out the night before..[Hook:]   I got friends with money, and I got money too   So we put it together and let you pick what to do   And then we do it!.alright, go out all night   ?This is?.Big wheels turning   Baby I know   Big wheels turning   Baby I know   Big wheels turning, turning,   Turning, turning....And tonight, she's waiting   On"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng’s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng’s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace..When I'm with people, I thank god,   I can talk hip when I'm crying inside..I dreamed about my mother,   Dear old Papa, Sister and brother,   I dreamed about that girl   Who's been waiting for so long..Sometime world, pass me by again,   Carry you, carry me, away..'Cause we're alone now, and   I'm singing this song for you      You taught me precious secrets   Of the truth, withholding nothing   You came out in front, I was hiding   Oh, but now I'm so much better   If the words don't come together   Just listen to the melody   'Cause my love's in there hiding   Oh, oh      Oh, I love you in a place   Where there's no space or time   Love you for my life   You are a friend of mine   And when my life is over   Remember when we were together   We were alone and   I was singing this song for you   We were alone   I was singing this song for you, oh   Singing   I was singing, singing, singing, singing, singing this song for you   Oh, yes   Singing this song for you.If the world goes blind   And I lose my mind   Will you show me the way?"
"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences. SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did..Whatever we've got we share....   La la la la la wee-ooo (Ay!).Oh, tell me why   I love you after all, Johnny, like that very first day   Don't laugh at me no more, Johnny..Happier than the morning sun   That's the way you said it would be   If I should ever bring you inside my life..Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder   Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made   Now I see the stars and I hear the rolling thunder   Thy art throughout the universe displayed   Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee   How great Thou art oh   How great Thou art   Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee   How great Thou art   How great Thou art   When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation   To take me home what joy shall fill my heart   Then I shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my God   How great Thou art   Then sings my soul"
"The author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus” with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself “I will take that test again,” shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng’s good character. It shows Saeng’s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with ”when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.”.And now I'm just glad he left me these..And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh   By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga   Just forget it, you talk it, I live it   Like Eli I did it, jokes on you mothafucker and I get it   No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me   Or-gy, or are we, speakin' metaphorically   Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam nigga   Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga   And a nigga still young, wanna have no kids   But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit   Had a few white girls, asses flat a shit   But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit   Got 'em jumpin' out the building   Watch out below, a million out the door      I'm about to go HAM   Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am   I'm about to go HAM   Hard as a mothafucker let these niggas know who I am      Fuck y'all mad at me for?.Just about dinner time   I'm eatin' bullets..If I ever have a doubt   What life is all about   I get my pencil out and then commence to doodlin'   And I find it real relaxing   'Specially when I feel that life is really taxing!.For what goes on in his mind   Work!"
"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn’t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, “but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.” thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  .Down deep in your soul   Do anything, I might even love you   Wow-oh.Someone has clawed out my eyes..Been beat up and battered 'round   Been sent up, and I've been shot down   You're the best thing that I've ever found   Handle me with care      Reputations changeable   Situations tolerable   Baby, you're adorable   Handle me with care      I'm so tired of being lonely   I still have some love to give   Won't you show me that you really care      Everybody's got somebody to lean on   Put your body next to mine, and dream on      I've been fobbed off, and I've been fooled   I've been robbed and ridiculed   In day care centers and night schools   Handle me with care      Been stuck in airports, terrorized   Sent to meetings, hypnotized   Overexposed, commercialized   Hand me with care      I'm so tired of being lonely   I still have some love to give   Won't you show me that you really care      Everybody's got somebody to lean on   Put your body next to mine, and dream on      I've been uptight and made a mess   But I'll clean it up myself, I guess   Oh, the sweet smell of success   Handle me with care.You say you want me..Halls Of Illusions   [Violent J]   Ticket please, thanks, walk through the door   Into the Halls Of Illusions, visit yours   And see what coulda and shoulda and woulda been real   But you had to fuck up tha whole deal   ""Lets take a walk down the hallway   It's a long way it, it takes all day!"""
"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it..Coming down again, coming down again   Coming down again, coming down again      Share your thoughts, there's nothing you can hide   She was dying to survive   I was caught, oh, taken for a ride   She was showing no surprise      Coming down again, coming down again   Where are all my friends, coming down again      Coming down again, coming down again   On the ground again, coming down again      Slipped my tongue in someone else's pie   Tasting better ev'ry time   She turned green and tried to make me cry   Being hungry it ain't no crime      Coming down again, coming down again   All my time's been spent, coming down again.If you ever   Went there, you would know what I'm talking   About..[Verse 2]   I only married Queen Caroline   When my debts began to climb   'Cause if I agreed to tie the knot   I said I'd pay off the lot!.(Yea) This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt   I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts   (Yea) This is my story, money, cars, bad hoes   This is my story eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)      Came from humble beginnings now I'm cocky with my spending   They say ""life is just a game"" and I thank God that I'm winning   Models roll my indo, I beat the pussy, Django   Them niggas talking money, I got more digits in my gate code   She make a pole disappear like hocus pocus (Hocus pocus, pocus)   You're ain't never gon' find another nigga this focused (Focused)   I got every block, every street corners sold up (Up)   Whatever club represent my city, throw it up (Up)   I own the game, coach slash player sho 'nough   Okay, haters forfeited never showed up, yup      This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt   I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts   This is my story, money, cars, bad hoes   This is my story eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   (Yea) And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   (2 Chainz) And I'm, stickin', to it (Uh huh)   And I'm, stickin', to it      Velcro, I'm sticking to it, hatin', I've been a victim to it   Your conversation is sanitation, ain't no hesitation when I finna do it   I stick it in (Uh) switch it up and try to hit a friend (Uh)   Live it up and count my dividends, roll, like cinnamon   Whoa, big face Benjamin's   And she looked at me like you ain't nothin' but a star   I looked at her like this ain't nothin' but a car   If you ride with them you ain't going that far   But if you ride with me (Me)   Crib so big we can play hide-and-seek (Play hide-and-seek)   You can confide to me, ride me like I ride the beat   Pilot seat, I need a co-pilot (Tell 'em), kiss a ass in both mouths (Tru)   Yeah I'm talking both lips, what you know 'bout boat trips?.I am your trash man-   Throw out all your trash today-   Clean out your mind today-   Please pass the weed   And please take some heed."
"The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test.

"There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says “a blossom of two would have blown into the well” It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said”she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.” This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing..Oh love, oh love, oh careless love..Got a good reason   For taking the easy way out..I can fly...   And touch the rainbow in the sky....And forget everything, baby      Hop in the car and go with me   You don't have to pack everything   Don't you want to feel the breeze?.""Say something""   ""Anything""   I'm warning you   I'm warning you   I'm fucking you   I'm warning you   ""Relax""   ""It's just a phase""   ""You'll grow out of it""   Believe anything anyone ever tells you   It's not funny anymore   It's thing you hate the most   The thing you hate the most   The thing you hate ALMOST"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says “In the spring when the snows melt” because she is beginning to get used to “the quiet repetition of season upon season”. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     .Fabolous and Missy, Sickalicious right..All devils eve the witches exchange energy   Black warlocks concentrate predicting prophecies   Announcing serenade uniting under stars   The celebration desecration from afar   Secret - evening - thunder   Pagans - dancing - under   Pale moon - rising - watching   Starlight - gazes - catching   All devils eve   All devils eve   All devils eve the candle red alights the Queen   The black familiars in pentacles of green   Flowing the bloodline past millennia so strong   Reciting atmospheres to tangle mortal song   Secret - evening - thunder   Pagans - dancing - under   Pale moon - rising - watching   Starlight - gazes - catching   All devils eve   All devils eve   All devils eve electric orgy spells are cast   Magnetic impulses circles painted last   The psychic inspiration rings the pewter bell   The bond exists in consciousness invisible   Secret - evening - thunder   Pagans - dancing - under   Pale moon - rising - watching   Starlight - gazes - catching   All devils eve.Raindrops have brought us together and that's what I longed to see..""I loved that song..And I hear your mournful songs   I hear your painful crys   And I've seen the light of hunger   Linger deep within your eyes   And you talk about your sinkin'   And what a hole you're in   You expect for me to love you   When you hate yourself my friend."
"The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory’s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject..And I'd rather be fightin' some old memories,   than to wonder if you ever really love me..Internal War   Killing our own   Burn the ones that have sinned against   Claim their lives in your death romance   Arm the young with your hunting toys   By your own actions you are all to blame   Power in the wrong hands our scaffold is destroyed   Children killing children because our government has ignored   I sling my arrows to shatter your walls   No more creating victims from ignorance   Left to second both sides   Each one cries and lies   No More War   You've killed again   My life for what   Bound hands   Yes you've all killed again   Stand by as dying children wait for life   The line has been crossed again   How long will it take   The line has been crossed again   How long will it take to protect life.Lay down   Lay down   Lay your sweet lovely on the ground   Lay your love on the track   We're gonna break the monster's back   Yes we are...   Lay down your treasure   Lay it down now brother   You don't have time   For a jealous lover      As you enter this life   I pray you depart   With a wrinkled face   And a brand new heart      I don't know if I can take it   I'm not easy on my knees   Here's my heart you can break it      I need some release, release, release      We need   Love and peace   Love and peace      Lay down   Lay down your guns   All your daughters of Zion   All your Abraham sons      I don't know if I can make it   I'm not easy on my knees   Here's my heart and you can break it   I need some release, release, release      We need   Love and peace   Love and peace      Baby don't fight   We can talk this thing through   It's not a big problem   It's just me and you   You can call or I'll phone   The TV is still on   But the sound is turned down   And the troops on the ground   Are about to dig in      And I wonder where is the love?.Blow a kiss..No one truly has the answers   Every day I struggle through it once more   Keep things bottled up, never speaking my mind   Misinterpreted, I'm doing just fine      Every day I put a brave face on, serves me well   Feeling helpless, facing it alone, hard to tell   That I can change who I am, how I feel, there's no end      I have done what you asked of me   Leaves me nothing to live for      Coming undone, way too high a price I should pay   You keep your pride while I die inside every day   No I can't lie anymore, won't pretend I've done all I can      You can't imagine the hell I'm going through   Not asking you to save me   I'm too far from heaven      Nothing you can do to change me   But accept me as I am"
"The author ends the story with “when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph..No one knew for sure if Ambrose was his name..One day I'll stop breathing   My heart will stop beating   I won't see your face again   This flesh and blood is weak   And life isn't ours to keep   Sometime it has to end   In time even memories fade away   With time you might live   To forgive and forget   The mistakes that I made      [Chorus]   I broke some promises   Sometimes I lied to you   But one thing will always be true   I'll never stop loving you      Fall from your grace   You'll never be replaced   God knows how hard I've tried   But it just ain't no use   I thought I could shake you loose   I'm still torn up inside   In time even memories fade away   With time you might live   To forgive and forget   The mistakes that I made      [Chorus: x2].Days when the rains came   Down in a hollow   Playin' a new game      Laughin' and a runnin'   Skippin' and a jumpin'   In the misty mornin' fog   With our hearts a thumpin'   It was you, my brown eyed girl   You, my brown eyed girl      Now what ever happened   Tuesday is oh so slow   Goin' down the old mine   With a transistor radio      Standin' in a sunlit lane   Hidin' 'hind a rainbow's wall   Slippin' and a slidin'   All along the waterfall   It was you, my brown eyed girl   You, my brown eyed girl      Do you remember when   We used to sing   Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da   Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da      So hard to find my way   Now that I'm on my own   Thought about it just the other day   My, where's the time all gone      Can't remember back then Lord   Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout   Makin' love in the green grass   Behind the stadium   With you, my brown eyed girl   Do you remember when   We used to sing   Sha la la la la la la la la la la ti da.But aah would you take me home?.Originality?"
"The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng‘s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she’s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons..with the thermal   I had that TEC in the bushes, run up on me I burn you   Folks they come to Atlanta, just to ride through my zone   Wanna see where I trapped at, they wanna see what's my home   In the place that I said, everything that I meant   I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads   I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread   If you play with Bricksquad, them might take off your head      I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high   I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high   She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up   And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up   I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high   I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high   She so high, but bitch with me so she good night   And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice      Bitch I bigger pay her or get bigger paid, everyday is a bigger day   Bigger nigga get a bigger gun, hit his ass in his bigger face   Bigger ?.Tuna   Rubber   A little blubber in my igloo   And I knew you pigtails and all   Girls when they fall   And they said Marianne killed herself   And I said not a chance   Don't you love girls ladies babes   Old bags who say she was so pretty why   Why why why did she crawl down in the old   Deep ravine      C'mon pigtails girls and all those sailors   Get your bags and hold down won't you just   Hold down cause Ed is watching my every sound   I said   They're watching my every sound      The weasal sqeuaks faster then a seven day week   I said Timmy and that purple Monkey   Are all down      At Bobby's house   Making themselves persters and lesters and jesters and my   Traitors of kind   And I'm just having thoughts of Marianne   She could outrun the fastest slug   She could   Marianne   Quickest girl in the frying pan.Taking orders from the   Provo City Little League..If you really want me that's reason enough..Is this world spinning round   Has this ship run aground   What's that shape   What's that sound   That's just me falling down      Some of us are free   Some are bound   Some will swim   Some will drown   Some of us are saints   Some are clowns   Just like me they're falling down      Well I lied to the nation   While my reputation ran dry   From my lungs to my liver   I clung to the river bank's side   Yeah well I'm back in the water   Doing what I ought to   Trying to lead an ordinary life      Is this world spinning round   Has this ship run aground   What's that shape   What's that sound   That's just me falling down      Some of us are green   Some are brown   Some are lost   Some are found   Sight unseen baby   Sound on sound   Pray for me I'm falling down      I was lost in the jungle   Crossed over enemy lines   Well I got me a red nose   By sleeping under hedgerows at night   Yeah well I tried levitation   Flying in formation   Heaven knows the weight of this crime      Is this   Is this world spinning round   Has this ship run aground   What's that shape   What's that sound   That's just me falling down      Falling down   Falling down"
"The Author of “Winter Hibiscus” ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant “dies” in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle..Everybody razed on the West Side [RIZE!].If it's getting harder to face everyday   Don't let it show, don't let it show   Though it's getting harder to take what they say   Just let it go   And if it hurts when they mention my name   Say you don't know me   And if it helps when they say I'm to blame   Say you don't own me      Even if it's taking the easy way out   Keep it inside of you   Don't give in   Don't tell them anything      Don't let it   Don't let it show      Even though you know it's the wrong thing to say   Say you don't care, say you don't care   Even if you want to believe there's a way   I won't be there, I won't be there      But if you smile when they mention my name   They'll never know you   And if you laugh when they say I'm to blame   They'll never own you      Even if you feel you've got nothing to hide   Keep it inside of you   Don't give in   Don't tell them anything      Don't let it   Don't let it show.Un uh      Ha shalom lo   Water...

"There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up..I rode past destruction in the ditches   With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo..You best step back, Korn on the cob, you need a new job..yes..I'm alive, I've come to realize not a moment too soon....MIMI   (Oh, you rule alone, Love!)"
"I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again..No fair, you can't hear me   But I can you..Tell Mama   Etta James      Your dogs ain't found a good girl,   One that love you and give you warning   Now you find that you been misused,   Well how many girls can think all right      She'd embarrass you anywhere,   She'd make her friends think that she didn't care   Give me the chance and I'd been begging   And I just want to take care of you and I want you to      Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need   Tell Mama, what you want and how that girl does things all right   Let me hear you say.Go for yourself..Well, the clouds didn't look like cotton   They didn't even look like clouds   I was underneath the weather   My friends looked a crowd   The swimmin' hole was full of rum   I tried to find out why   All I learned was this my friend   You got to swim before you fly      I got two girls   One's in heaven and one's below   Oh, one I love with all my heart   And one I do not know..Way down in the Congoland   Lived a happy chimpanzee."
" The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn’t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn’t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task.It goes on and on, this insanity,   The game of us and them we play..Do you want to repeat lines   Or write your own?.Well, I know what it means to hide your heart   From a long time ago   Oh, darlin'      It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'   It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'   It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'   It keeps you runnin', yeah, it keeps you runnin'.Cumpare sing,   Cumpare su,   And dance 'sta tarantella..But I remember...      Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer."
" The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way..But now I'm standing on the corner,   Lost in the things that i said..It goes on to say, ""I love you..Who's seen the kisses left in dim lit bars?.You don't want to play by the rules   (you don't want to play by the rules)   I don't want to love here anymore   (I don't want to love here anymore)   You don't want to play by the rules   (you don't want to play by the rules)      You (you)   Don't (don't)   Play (play)   By the rules   I (I)   Won't (don't)   Love here anymore      You don't want to play by the rules   (you don't want to play by the rules)   'cause I don't want to love here anymore   (I don't want to love here anymore).It's always been the same, same old story."
" I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  .Livin' on your cheatin'   And the pain grows inside me   It's enough to leave me crying in the rain   Love you forever but you're   Driving me insane   And I'm hanging on   Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in      Our love has got the power   Too many lovers in one lifetime   Ain't good for you   You treat me like a vision in the night   Someone there to stand behind you   When your world ain't working right      I ain't no vision, I am the man   Who loves you inside out   Backwards and forwards with   My heart hanging out   I love no other way      What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?.What's that a blond hair?.Catch a boat to England, baby,   Maybe to Spain,   Wherever I have gone,   Wherever I've been and gone,   Wherever I have gone   The blues, they're all the same..Sink down, sink, sink down down..Wildflowers grow everywhere   Vibrations flow, things will have to change   (good evening, madam."
"The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver’s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on..what can you do?.And a real famous cat all dressed up in red,   and he spends the whole year working out on his sled,   it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick..Hey you, see me, pictures crazy,   All the world I've seen before me passing by,   I've got, nothing, to gain, to lose,   All the world I've seen before me passing by,      You don't care about how I feel,   I don't feel it anymore,   You don't care about how I feel,   I don't feel it anymore   You don't care about how I feel,   I don't feel it anymore,   You don't care about how I feel,   I don't feel it anymore..No feet to fall,   You need no ground,   Allowed to glide right through the sun,   Released from circles guarded tight,   Now we all are chosen ones..-From Clone High-      The ancient pharoh's were not to bright they say   But they made one contribution, that I live by to this day   It's the food pyramid, and it's approved by the U.S.D.A."
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her”. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test..I'm a super cop      I was born to serve justice   Get my name   I'm a super cop      Kung fu action is my game   I'm a cop now   A super cop now      He drives around in a world turned upside down   I'm a cop now   A super cop now      He's gotta round up all the evil clowns   I'm a cop now      A super cop now      What he sees just makes him want to cry   I'm a cop now   A super cop now      He works alone 'cause if he don't he'll die      (spoken) the truth and protect   The motto I ascribe to   With equal justice   For the down and out or well to do   I'm a super cop   A gangster's worst nightmare   One man demolition team   I'll send them into disrepair      He's been fighting,   Fighting for so long      I'm a super cop      He's been righting,   Righting every wrong      I'm a super cop      Now he's hiding   From the long arm of the law      I'm a cop now   A super cop now   He gets up and tries to save the world      I'm a cop now   A super cop now   He goes out and tries to find a girl      I'm a cop now   A super cop now   If you're a punk he'll aim straight for your belt      I'm a cop now   A super cop now   He makes the news every time he kicks some butt      Super cop   Super cop   Super cop   Super cop      Super cop   Super cop   Super cop   Super cop      Super cop   Super cop   Super cop   Super cop.You can mislead a man,   You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes..Mash it up now   That's exactly what we gonna do   Make it good      You are so beautiful   You are so wonderful   And you can make your dreams   Make them come true      You get through everything   And cast a laugh and sing   You can do anything   That you want to      You bring the sunshine when it's dark   With nothing but love sweet love   And make me smile and say it's fine   When I haven't got a dime   Love, true love   And when things are going wrong   We can fix it with a song   I know we can now      We gonna do it   You don't need expensive furs   You don't need no diamonds and pearls   You don't need that witchcraft world   To make your dreams come true      You don't need no Cadillac car   You don't have to be no movie star   Just what you are   And I know that you make it through      You are the essence of   Everything I love   Oh baby oh baby      It's a positive vibration   Going in circulation   We gonna give it to the nation   Through this evaporation      I feel it deep, deep down inside.Come and put your name on it   Put your name on it   Come and put your name on it   Your name   Bet you wanna put your name on it   Put your name on it   Come and put your name on it   Ba-ba-baby      It's not even my birthday   But he want to lick the icing off   I know you want it in the worst way   Can't wait to blow my candles out      He want that cake, cake,   Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake   Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake   Cake, cake, cake      Ooh baby, I like it   You so excited   Don't try to hide it   I'ma make you my bitch   Cake, cake, cake, cake   Cake, cake, cake, cake   Cake, cake, cake, cake   Cake, cake, cake, cake      I know you wanna bite this   Its so enticin'   Nothin' else like this   I'ma make you my bitch      And it's not even my birthday   But you wanna put your name on it   And it's not even my birthday   And he tryna put his name on it   Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now   Just get up on my body   I'll do anything.And the mercy seat is waiting   And I think my head is burning   And in a way I'm yearning   To be done with all this measuring of truth."
"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that “when they come back ... I will take the test again,” (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, “A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept “(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. .Don't smile   Lest a innocent Chile   The power of God is gonna get to be your Tao   Throw like a hit from the best   Take it in a slump   Ha ha   Feel it in your chest..When the windows all are broken and your love's become a toothless crone,   When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd,   Winter morning breaks, you're all alone..[Cornelius:]   Don't you think my dancing has a polish and a flair?.Well, I fear that the music will end,   And shatter the spell it may lend..Fires gonna burn   Think of consequence   Then you move when it your turn      [Chorus:]      Walking on my own   Leaving you behind   You were crying out   That you need to speak your mind      [Chorus:]   Haunt you everyday"
"The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom..There's no business like show business like no business I know   Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow   Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow      There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low   Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold   Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show      The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk   Are secretly unhappy men because   The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk   Get paid for what they do but no applause..It's only small town talk   They're telling all the lies   And make some people crazy   They don't realize we're still thinking..How can we be lovers if we can't be friends?.Every mile, see him smile with the dust in his eyes..[Verse 1]   I can taste it on your mouth and I can't leave it   You're a freak like me, can't you see?"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver’s test. “She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. “This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she’ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2..I'm getting closer to her   And the closer I get   The more I lose my fear of loneliness      A step outside in the rain,   They just close the cinemas   I'm light years away from you as I drive in my car   And your love shines like a neon sign,      It ain't so far   But the distance is unbelievable   What is love: unbelievable   What is freedom ?.And a little old Jim Beam and we'd get right   And you know these flashing lights sure make me dizzy   And this disco's very strange to my ears   Looks like they turned the longhorn into a spaceship   And I'll be leaving just a soon as I finish this beer      Cause you see I'm a dinosaur   I should have died out a long time before   Have Pitty on a dinosaur   Hand me my hat excuse me mam   But where's the door!.Like the folks you meet on   Like to plant my feet on the Brooklyn Bridge   What a lovely view from   Heaven looks at you from the Brooklyn Bridge      I love to listen to the wind through her strings   The song that she sings for the town   I love to look up at the clouds in her hair   She's learned to wear like a crown      If you've been a rover   Journey's end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge   Don't let no one tell you   I've been tryin' to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge      All the folks in Manhattan are sad   'Cause they look at her and wish they had   The good old Brooklyn Bridge      If you've been a rover   Journey's end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge   Don't let no one tell you   I've been tryin' to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge      You'll miss her most when you roam   'Cause you'll think of her and think of home   The good old Brooklyn Bridge.Can you feel it?.Down to the village,   With a broomstick in his hand,   Running here and there all   Around the square saying,   Catch me if you can."
"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, ”Its not a real one”  ""Not like the kind we had before.” Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered..The real me not my fly alter-ego?.They said yeah, yeah, yeah      I can't stop, can't stop rockin'.Be Bop A Lula she's my baby   Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe   Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll..I feel like rocking, I wanna with you!.   What am I gonna do ?"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng’s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author’s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph..One at a time..See the sun rise over her skin   Don't change it   See the sun rise over her skin   Dawn changes everything   Everything   And the delta sun   Burns bright and violet      Mississippi and the cotton wool heat   Sixty-six a highway speaks   Of deserts dry   Of cool green valleys   Gold and silver veins   Of the shining cities      In this heartland   In this heartland soil   In this heartland   Heaven knows this is a heartland   Heartland...heartland      See the sun rise over her skin   She feels like water in my hand   Freeway like a river cuts through this land   Into the side of love   Like a burning spear   And the poison rain   Brings a flood of fear   Through the ghost-ranch hills   Death valley waters   In the towers of steel   Belief goes on and on      In this heartland   In this heartland soil   In this heartland   Heaven knows this is a heartland   Heartland...heaven knows this is a heartland   Heartland...heartland   Heartland...heaven's day here in the heartland   Heart....'Cause you keep me coming back for more   And I feel a little better than I did before   And if I never see your face again, I don't mind   'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight      Sometimes you move so well   It's hard not to give in..Well its been rainin' on and on   Ever since you've been gone   Those dark clouds keep rollin' in   And every time I think I might catch myself a glimpse of sunlight   The bottom falls out again   Well I can barely keep afloat   I'm up the creek without a boat   And I've been adriftin' heaven knows how long   'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone      Hey, well drip drip drip goes the sound of the rain   The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane   My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm   I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms   Safe and warm   Girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine   Baby won't you come back home   'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone      Aw listen to me now   I keep starin' out the window   Searchin' for a rainbow   To signal that the storm will end   Hey, 'cause I know that the rain'll keep pourin' on the pane   Until my saint comes back marchin' in   Oh, girl its been a long time since I've seen sunshine   Baby won't you come back home   'Cause it's been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone   Hey, well drip drip drip goes the sound of the rain   The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane   My friends said I should settle for any port in a storm   I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms   Safe and warm   Girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine   Baby won't you come back home   'Cause its been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone   Yeah its been rainin' forty days and forty nights since you've been gone.Is life everything you want to be,   Does it give you everything that you need,   Does it live up to your expectations,   Are you ready for the celebrations."
"Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story “Winter Hibiscus” the author uses the conclusion “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again” he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says “and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went” It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn’t pass her test she doesn’t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  .We got the mother and the kids   We got the guy and his date   We all get mad   We all get laid   Looks like somebody forgot about us   Standin' on the corner   Waitin' for a bus   Say hey mister driver man   Don't be slow   Cause I got somewhere I got to go   Say hey mister driver man   Drive that thing fast   My precious time keep slippin' past   Lets call the mayor lets complain   Looks like the city's done to us again   Tied up in traffic what'ya know   The damn city bus moves so slow   I said hey mister driver man   Don't be slow   'Cause I got somewhere I got to go   Say hey mister driver man   Drive that thing fast   My precious time keep slippin' past.Erase the race that claim the place   And say we dig for ore.   ""See the light ram through the gaps in the land."".Hand in hand, heart to heart   We never should have let it start   But it's too late, we shared it all   Now it's time to share the blame      Face to face, toe to toe   Where we'll stop.And lately I've little cause to smile,   Ever since she goose-stepped down the aisle..I'm a taxi driver on an all-nighter   Don't want to fall asleep at the wheel   Play me some feel   4 AM business is slow   I listen to my radio   If no one flags me down, I turn up the sound   Moving to the beat   I cruise the empty streets   Changing the gears   Filling up my ears   Help me stay awake   Don't take a commercial break   I need another fare   So stay on the air   Won't you play me some driving music   Won't you play me some driving music   I'm a daydreamer   My speedometer says   I'd better take it slow   Or my speaker's gonna blow up   Help me stay awake   Don't take a commercial break   I need another fare   So stay on the air   Won't you play me some driving music   Won't you play me some driving music   Please won't you play me my request   I want to hear it one more time   Just for luck   Spin it again 'fore the sun comes up   Seems like I'm always changing dials   Station to station, mile after mile   Won't you play me some driving music   Won't you play me some driving music"
" The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ’’Winter Hibiscus’’ with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over…’’ In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding… connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ’’take that test again…’’ By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ’’@CAPS1 of loss.’’ and to her grief.      .It doesn't matter to you   It matters to me      We're cut adrift   We're still floating   I'm only hanging on   To watch you go down   My love      I disappeared in you   You disappeared from me   I gave you everything you ever wanted   It wasn't what you wanted      The men who love you, you hate the most   They pass through you like a ghost   They look for you, but your spirit is in the air   Baby, you're nowhere      Oh...love...   You say in love there are no rules   Oh...love...   Sweetheart,   You're so cruel      Desperation is a tender trap   It gets you every time   You put your lips to her lips   To stop the lie      Her skin is pale like God's only dove   Screams like an angel for your love   Then she makes you watch her from above   And you need her like a drug      Oh...love...   You say in love there are no rules   Oh...love...

"In the short story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society..Oooh,   B-B-Boy,   Oooh,   B-B-Boy,   Oooh,   B-B-Boy,   Oooh,   My gangsta boy,   B-B-Boy,   Oooh,   B-B-Boy,   Oooh,   B-B-Boy,   Oooh,   B-B-Boy,   Oooh,   My gangsta boy.The rain and the wind and the song and the love you bring..I, I, I never would have thought it would end this way, I lied   I never have believed that we would separate   What we have now is how it stands   And now I wish you'll try to make it stay   The way we are is here and now   I wish you'd make the most of all we have today      Before you go and give it away   Hold on for one more shot   Before you let it slip away   Hold on for one more shot      I did not believe, I did not mean to hurt you no more   I never meant to let you down, down   Though the silver lining wears through   I still do not mean to hurt you, no   When the sound of your voice is not ringing through   Beginning to question whether I should be around      Before you go and give it away   Hold on for one more shot   Before you let it slip away   Hold on for one more shot      Before you go and give it away   Hold on for one more shot   Before you let it slip away   Hold on for one more shot.What's it cost you, darling?.Woah, woah...   She's the refugee."
"All throughout the story “Winter Hibiscus”, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng’s future and growing confidence..You wake up to an empty night..Up above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes   These things are the colors of the blues   In the mail your letter came the ink and paper looked the same   Blue must be the color of the blues   Bluebird's singing in the trees seems to sympathize with me   But he ain't singing like he used to do   The pearly waters in the sea are as cold as you left me   Blue must be the color of the blues      There's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red   Blue must be the color angels choose   A blue suit you proudly wore when you left to return no more   Blue must be the color of the blues   Blue days come and blue days go how I feel nobody knows   Life is mighty empty without you   There's a blue note in each song that I sang since you've been gone   Blue must be the color of the blues.Why do you believe that we've got something coming,   You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,   Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,   Too far away..Every lonely city   Where I hang my hat,   Aint as half as pretty   As where my babys at..[Chorus]      [Outro: kung fu sample]   You've learned how to kill   Every moved you've learned is trained to that end   Yet, we wish to preserve life   The first thing to learn, is that difference   Then you can start training with us, from the beginning"
"I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize’s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her..doot, doot doot..You've become an island in the hazy world surrounding me   Offering a vast reward each time I safely cross the sea   All too often I become lost in the fog and haze   Clinging still, against my will, to promises of clearer days      I am just a raindrop that accelerates without control   Losing bits and pieces in descent 'til I'm no longer whole   I am just another shooting star above that you might see   Until I have your full attention I'll be anything but me   Anything but me.But at least you thought you wanted it   Which is so much more than I can say for me..Don't want no airplanes, no ticket on a fast train,   All I wanted was a two-lane, with you by my side..Traveling in a fried-out Kombi   On a hippie trail, head full of zombie   I met a strange lady, she made me nervous   She took me in and gave me breakfast   And she said      Do you come from a land down under?"
"The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver’s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again.This only happens once a year!.Oh, watch out!.How come you came this far?.You didn't know   You've been alone   You've been away      There's always something out there.I guess you're in London today,   And I don't wanna need you this way,   Come back, be here, come back, be here."
"Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past..Oh...   Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring   La...      You're clever   Everybody's clever nowadays   You're clever   Everybody's clever nowadays      You are sleeping   You do not want to believe   You are sleeping   You do not want to believe   You are sleeping   You do not want to believe   You are sleeping.But the second part, the second part is really nifty,      (takes a deep breath) ok      She'd go   I'd go   we'd      Then those two-bit johnny's did it around   to cheer the best attraction in town   they nearly tore the balcony down,   and we'd say: ok boys we're going home,   but before we go here's a few more partin' shots,   and this, this we did in perfect unison      (instrumental)      Now you see me going through it   you make think there's nothing to it   but I simply cannot do it... Alone(hold note).She'll never see that seaport town   Called Canadee-i-o..Yeah yeah      (adam gets punched out).I want to have dinner with Gershwin   I want to watch Rembrandt sketch   I want to talk theory with Curie   Impossible I guess      I want to talk moods with Picasso   On a rendezvous   I want to fly double with Earhart   I want to get next to you   Next to you      So close   Just as close as I can get   The rain of your worry   Can't effect   What I feel is what I feel   One touch   Of your greatness   Is what I need   My circle of fantasy   Would be complete      I want to sing hymns with Mahalia   When the day is through   I want to tell you about it   I want to get next to you   Next to you      So close   Just as close as I can get   The rain of your worry   Can't effect   What I feel is what I feel   One touch   Of your greatness   Is what I need   My circle of fantasy   Would be complete      So close   Just as close as I can get   The rain of your worries   Can't effect   What I feel is what I feel   One touch   Of your greatness   Is what I need   My circle of fantasy   Would be complete      I want to have dinner with Gershwin   I want to watch Rembrandt sketch   I want to talk theory with Curie   Impossible I guess"
"The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.” This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation..Ooh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style   I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile      Last year when I had to send my Christmas cards   I had to sign my name alone   But now your name is next to mine   And there's more love in every line   I'm wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone I've known      No more blue Christmases they'll all be bright   No more just pretending to be happy when I'm sad   Going through the motions while others feel glad      No more blue Christmases now that I've found you   Oh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style   I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile      Last year when I had to buy my Christmas gifts   I had to do it on my own   Ooh, champagne parties everywhere but without you I just didn't care   Now there's more than just a Christmas tree to decorate my home      No more blue Christmases now that I've found you   Oh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style   I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile      No more blue Christmases now that I've found you   Ooh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style   I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile, oh   I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile      Merry Christmas everyone.Students   Now we pledge ourselves to hold this barricade   Let them come in their legions   And they will be met   Have faith in yourselves   And don't be afraid   Let's give 'em a screwing   That they'll never forget!.""Why is the world so creepy?.So listen, listen to me,   Ooh you must believe me,   I can feel your eyes go throught me,   But I don't know why..You made me cry, and I cried a lot."
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything..It's not the spotlight, it's not the cam'ra light,   It's not the streetlights of some old street of dreams..Voices   Don't go near him, Mr. Mayor   The load is heavy as hell   The old man's a goner for sure   It'll kill you as well..Are you excitable?.We are down, we are crazy fools everyday at school..The lesser loyalties depart,   And neither race nor creed remain   From bitter searching of the heart."
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the story with the quote ""when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother ""comes back"" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again..Baby got the whole world standing up   Damn I bet a pitcher took a chance on love   Baby love....I will give you life   You'll serve only me   And my will to kill   You will kill for me      All that I desire   All that I command   You are here for me   I'm your master      My creation      I will make for you   A soul mate to love   Unlike your love for me   And you will take my name      She will be your bride   She will serve me too   And I will introduce you to   The Bride of Frankenstein.Clouds open dust and waves rise up to   Obscure God's very blue sky..Afraid to be caught   Afraid to be free   Afraid to make love   Afraid of vd   Afraid of the rain   Don't like to get wet   Afraid to take drugs   They make me forget   Afraid that the air   Will make me get sick   Afraid that a girl   Will cut off my.... Oh!.Goodbye, papa, please pray for me   I was the black sheep of the family   ""I don't know all these words   I have bought three turds   With my bb-gun I would kill birds""      We had joy, we had fun,   We had seasons in the sun   But the hills that we climbed   Were just seasons out of time      All our lives, we had fun   We had seasons in the sun   But the hill that we reached   Were just starfish on the beach      Goodbye, michelle, my little one   ""I was the apple of the shiny sun."
"The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved.But I lose myself..Put your dad on the phone!.You know you love your man   Two hundred miles an hour   Drinking up the fumes   And you're never more alive   When you feel his power   You gotta have it today   Cause a woman gets hot   You're racing for the man in the cloak   Ah you're living your life on fire   You see, but it's out of bounds company      [Chorus]   (Fast company)   I with the lights, heart beats   Dancing to the music   Lord I just burst into fire   No wonder I can't sleep   I got a feeling today   I wanna get all hot   All my dreams explodes with a shot   Lord I'd be living   My life on the Caribbean Sea   But it's out of bounds company      (Fast company)   You see you're on the way to come   You say you're one your way to go   Baby the heart's speaking paradise   But you - Help me   Get your big life   Fast company      [Chorus]      (Fast company)   You see you're on the way to come   You say you're one your way to go   Baby the heart's speaking paradise with me   Fast Company.Papa he talks to me   Don't try your heart   Gets deep inside you   Does you real harm   Don't you care?.Yo I coulda' been had fame   Jump shot with a stupid ass aim   Cause you couldn't around the last name   So my crossover wins the last game   And it's ill right?"
"Confidence, persistance, memories – all things that Saeng has “that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, “then I will take that test again,” shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won’t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saeng’s life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country..Did you see your children   Growing up today,   And did you hear the   Music of their laughter   As they set about to play?.(no no no)   Momma's, daddy's, sister's, brother's,   Friends, and cousins..I knew it was there   Though I tried to hide it   The feeling just kept on shining through   Haven't known you that long   So I try to deny it   But the feeling was much too much too strong      Could this be love   Deep down inside   Tearing me apart   I feel it in my heart      Constantly, you're on my mind   Thinking about you all the time   I can't sleep no matter what I do   I just keep on thinking 'bout you      Why do I feel this way   When I know you have someone   That you're seeing each and every day   Should I play this game   Of just being your friend   When I know that's not where I want it to end      How could this be wrong   When the feeling's so strong   Tearing me apart   I feel it in my heart      Constantly, you're on my mind   Thinking about you all the time   I can't sleep no matter what I do   I just keep on thinking 'bout you      Constantly, you're on my mind   Thinking about you all the time   I can't sleep no matter what I do   I just keep on thinking 'bout you      No I don't want to start no trouble   Between you and I and your lover   But I must tell you what I'm going through   Everytime you walk by I see love in your eyes.? ).You can talk to me about powder-kegs   And how I'm sittin' on one right now."
"The author of “Winter Hibiscus”chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She says, “I will take that test again”. The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied. The hibiscus in the sentence ""…when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...” @CAPS1 starting over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to highlight the theme and symbolize a new start.I don't know that I will ever trust again,.What do you think about me?.Cause I'm stiched up like an angel chord, I'm fixed up   They try to run and hide somehere in there defense   And now want to hand me down again......Oh baby   Don't let it be..And she came and I came in   That's perfect time   That pussy wet, man it's too wet   It got me sliding   I'm a vet   Got a a mean chick   But shawty riding      [Hook]"
"I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn’t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way..Her leaving sure brought me closer to that cold, cold ground..Want you to know you can feel me darlin'!.I'm going down   To a place where I can see all there is to see in me..Alabama Man!.I guess I'll have to put you down on my list,   I didn't want to do it but you insist."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers’ test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime..Love that woman, yes, your everything to me   Whoa, 'cause you're a friend and lover   Just as sweet as good as a woman should be      I love you baby   I love you baby   I love that woman   I love that woman   I love that woman   I love that woman.Dying alone, naturally..I just max like I'm playing the sax   And take the crowd to the climax   Yo, Cool J, I'll never go astray   I'm funky you can hear me at the Milky Way   You're weak, wick raps, I'm cool as jazz   Got razzmatazz ask my man Shabazz   I know you're afraid because I'm self-made   I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade   MC's are terror-struck, I'ma run amuck   Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck   Just a toy boy, can't stop my convoy   Rhymes I said last year were just decoys   I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox   I'm back with a style that's unorthodox   You must of had a teaspoon full of bull   I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful   They try to get with this, to me that's an insult   Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult   I enter like a giant saying fee fi foe fum   Then rock the auditorium until it's pandemonium   I'm dropping 'em      Yo E, dropping 'em      Don't sleep, cause I'ma go deeper   All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper   My rhymes are rising, the angle's getting steeper   I hated Mussolini Martini so I'ma sweep a   Emcee, like he's one of the two   Break him into fragments right in front of you   Mic check one two, is too fundamental   My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental   In the center, I had to enter   Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor   Of lyrics, so all you non-believers   It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a   Rude awakening, you can't do anything   You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring   Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence   Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced   That the crew invader, soloist exterminator   Greater evader of ducks, concert crusader   Is bad, my nickname's the circuit breaker   Eating up the world, acre by acre   I'm dropping 'em      Word to mother, dropping 'em!.Jesse rides through the night   Under the Main Street light   Ridin' slow      This ol' town, ain't the same   Now nobody knows his name   Times have changed, still he rides..You're built like a car, you've got a hub cap diamond star halo."
"The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects..Kis liye maine pyaar kiya   Dil ko yuhi bekarar kiya   Sham savere teri raah dekhi   Raat din intazar kiya) - (2)   Kis liye maine pyaar kiya      Aankho me mai ne kajal dala   Mathe pe bindiya lagai   Aise me tu aa jaye to   Kya ho ram duhai   Chhup ke muh me armano ne   Li kaisi angadai   Koi dekhe to kya samjhe   Ho jaye rusvai   Mai ne kyon singar kiya   Dil ko yu bekarar kiya   Sham savere teri raah dekhi   Raat din intazar kiya ho   Kis liye maine pyaar kiya      Aaj vo din hai jiske liye mai   Tadpi banke radha   Aaj mere man ki bachaini   Bad gai aur zyada   Pyaar me dhoka na kha jaye   Ye man sidha-sada   Aisa na ho jhutha nikale   Aaj milan ka vada   Mai ne kyon aitabar kiya   Dil ko yuhi bekarar kiya   Sham savere teri raah dekhi   Raat din intazar kiya ho   Kis liye maine pyaar kiya   Dil ko yuhi bekarar kiya   Sham savere teri raah dekhi   Raat din intazar kiya ho   Kis liye maine pyaar kiya.You came 'round today   You never even knocked on my door   Your note tried to say   That you don't love me no more      Bridge:   I want you by my side cause   I want to be your man   I'm burning up inside cause   I want to be your man      I had to be told   From people that I meet in the street   They are turning cold   Without you I would not be complete      I want you by my side cause   I want to be your man   I'm burning up inside cause   I want to be your man      Why did you write me in a letter   A word from you would be much better      I want you by my side cause   I want to be your man   I'm burning up inside cause   I want to be your man      Don't cast me aside   Without you I could never survive   Why did you decide   To kill the love that keeps me alive      I want you by my side cause   I want to be your man   I'm burning up inside cause   I want to be your man.Will, he be the one to make it, to help make it right?.Is there some space where the parkin' sign says free?.The weight is my soul      The weight is my soul, come to me."
"The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she’ll survive also. Although the flower isn’t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she’ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     .Here comes the sun.When you're gone   How can I even try to go on?.And when you hear this shit,   It makes the world say damn, I want to kill Sam..Look up, I look up at night   Planets are moving at the speed of light   Climb up, up in the trees   Every chance that you get   Is a chance you seize   How long am I gonna stand   With my head stuck under the sand?.And after such a blazing day   At last the breeze began to play   I drained my glass and turned to see   Her face she smiled she spoke to me   I told her my name I asked her the same   She said they call me sky   Sky   Said she is in danger maybe a stranger   Might know a place near by   And she talked and she smoked little more than a job   All the cares of my life went away on that day   In that room coming out of the gloom   And the gift that she gave follow me to the grave from on   Life goes on   Now you gone   Life goes on after sky   Life goes on after sky   So much can change without a sign   A twist of fate two worlds alight   The words get spoken all worlds were broken   The wind began to sign   The heat of daybreak the precious keepsake   Too soon the last goodbye   And the death in her eyes come enraged of the skies   For the day of my birth was the last day on earth   Like a boat in the night gets a moment of light   I could see what I've done what must be from now on   Life goes on   Now you're gone   Life goes on after sky   Life goes on after sky      Ahhh sky   Ahhh sky      Life goes on   Now you're gone   Life goes on after sky   Life goes on after sky      Sky   Sky"
"The author added the last paragraph because Saeng’s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better..I hear my heart beatin' faster   I feel it in my bones   I want it now 'cause I have ta   But why no-one knows   I'm like the angel on the A train   My eyes is diamond white   And from the cradle till your insane   The life you have to fight   But no-one really knows why there's a spirit in the sky   There's escape so long   He will understand while I take him by the hand   Why life's time tunnel is long   Well it will be alright   If you stay tonight   It's where we both belong   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on      I hear my heart beatin' faster   I feel it in my bones   I want it now 'cause I have ta   But why no-one knows   I'm like the angel on the A train   My eyes is diamond white   And from the cradle till your insane   The life you have to fight   But no-one really knows why there's a spirit in the sky   There's escape so long   He will understand while I take him by the hand   Why life's time tunnel is long   Well it will be alright   If you stay tonight   It's where we both belong   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on      It's gonna be alright   You're gonna stay tonight   It's where we both belong   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on   It's gonna be full on.Stepping inside I fixed myself into a seat   Holding on, lord, I heard them engines start to beat   Big silver bird let me inside your plane   Want to fly so high, fly me high away   (instrumental part).All I really want to do   Is, baby, be friends with you..All hail Me!.I don't want to control you, so baby if she's gonna hold you,   Then why don't you just stay, stay where you've been."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about. It is about how Saeng misses home and filed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. She let herself by the flower and remember her home. That make her sad. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story. It shows her getting used to the new home.I smile when I'm angry..Can't you hear my call?.Changes are vital, do we care?.You better change your attitude   Cause you know you want it to   You bring me all your pride   But I know you hold it too   I can feed your bounty, yeah   If you feed my head as well   And I won't give you empty promises, yeah   When the quarter's in the wishing well      But this ain't no sentimental movie   Where dreams collect like dust   You talk to me with innocence in your eyes   So now, who can you trust?.You keep the dagger close at hand."
"The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it’s strong enough to live through the winter.The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes..[Repeat]      Children say Charlie is happy   Giving balloons to the angels instead..E te, beltade ignota, cinta di chiome bionde!.And I am still inside you..(Halloween?).Will tomorrow be the same blood   Rushin thru my veins   [Chorus:]   I'm alive I can feel the blood rushing thru my veins an that's all I need   Know 'cause I'm not looking for a change."
"The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time..Mmmm mmm yeah   Do do do do do do do-do   Ohh Yeah      Gotta change my answering machine   Now that I'm alone   Cuz right now it says that we   Can't come to the phone   And I know it makes no sense   Cuz you walked out the door   But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore   It's ridiculous   It's been months   And for some reason I just   Can't get over us   And I'm stronger than this   Enough is enough   No more walkin round   With my head down   I'm so over being blue   Cryin over you      And I'm so sick of love songs   So tired of tears   So done with wishing you were still here   Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow   So why can't I turn off the radio?.But one day the streets fell silent,   Yet they knew not what was wrong..On your own,   All alone and crying   A wounded soul on an island in the blue   Love's required   But you're too tired from trying   Don't Give Up   There's love enough for you      [Chorus]   There's love enough for a broken heart   Love enough for another start   Love enough in the Father's arms for you   When it feels like the tears won't end   When loneliness is your only friend   There's love enough   Love enough for you   On His own   Allone and dying   He gave up everything for me and you   Hear your heart   It's time to start relying   On the one who had love enough for you      [Chorus]   Like a cup that's running over   Like a well that won't run dry   From the storm a constant cover   For a heart, the sole supply   Chorus (2X)   Love enough for you   Love enough, love enough   Love enough for me   Love enough for you.In the middle of late last night I was sittin' on a curb   I didn't know what about but I was feeling quite disturbed   A street sweeper came whistlin' by   He was bouncin' every step   It seemed strange how good he felt   So I asked him while he swept      He said ""It's my job to be cleaning up this mess   And that's enough reason to go for me   It's my job to be better than the rest   And that makes the day for me""      Got an uncle who owns a bank he's a self made millionaire   He never had anyone to love never had no one to care   He always to seemed kind of sad to me   So I asked him why that was   And he told me it's because in my contract there's a clause   That says ""It's my job to worried half to death   And that's the thing people respect in me   It's a job but without it I'd be less   Than what I expect from me""      I've been lazy most all of my life   Writing songs and sleeping late   Any manual labor I've done purely by mistake   If street sweepers can smile then   I've got no right to feel upset   But sometimes I still forget   Till the lights go on and the stage is set   And the song hits home and you feel that sweat      It's my job to be different than the rest   and that's enough reason to go for me   It's my job to be better than the best   and that's a tough break for me   It's my job to be cleaning up this mess   and that's enough reason to go for me      It's my job to be better than the best   and that makes the day for me.You got the best of me   Whoah can't you see?"
"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese “slowly fading into the distance” she thought of herself. “When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. “the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. “This hibiscus is budding” states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again” because it’s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng..I don't have an explanation   For another lonely night   I just feel this sense of mission   And the sense of what is right      Take it easy on my now   I'd be there if I could   I'm so full of what is right   I can't see what is good      It's a hopeless situation   Lie awake for half the night   You're not sure what's going on here   But you're sure it isn't right      Make it easy on yourself   There's nothing more you can do   You're so full of what is right   You can't see what is true      A quality of justice   A quantity of light   A particle of mercy   Makes the color of right      Gravity and distance   Change the passage of light   Gravity and distance   Change the color of right.Heaven is counting on you   Run with a heart that is true   Carry the cross, reaching the lost   Heaven is counting on you   We are standing at the end of time   We are part of a grand design   We are grateful to a risen Lord   For the others who have gone before   I hear voices in the heavenlies   They are calling to you and me   Saying rise up, there's a world to win   I hear them saying again   Heaven is counting on you   Run with a heart that is true   Carry the cross, reaching the lost   Heaven is counting on you   Many suffered, even gave their lives   For the message of the risen Christ   Now they're watching seated high above   Shouting to us as we run   Heaven is counting on you   Run with a heart that is true   Carry the cross, reaching the lost   Heaven is counting on you   There is a race, there is a prize   There is a price to pay   And the saints beyond   Cheer us on today   Heaven is counting on you   Run with a heart that is true   Carry the cross, reaching the lost   Heaven is counting on you.[Verse:]   Because of love He left His throne and made this earth His home   He did it willingly, for you and me, with heaven left behind   He came to save all mankind, from sin and shame   He could have walked away, but instead He chose to stay upon that tree   And take a crown of thorns for me, because of love      [Chorus:]   Because of love He bore my pain, shouldering the blame   Why did He choose to go, how could He love me so?.Now inspire me to more   Inspire me to more..Well, I've seen 'em on the TV, the movie show   They say the times are changing but I just don't know   These things are gone forever   Over a long time ago, oh yeah"
"The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything’s going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it’s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph..She sucked my asshole, she sucked my toes, she's the suckinest bitch alive..Tuna..Welcome to the show, the great finale's finally here   I thank you for coming into my theater of fear   Welcome to the show, you're all witnesses, you see   A privileged invitation to the last rites of me   Remember me?.Are her eyes very bright,   Charming Billy?.Are you ready for the fallout?"
" In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her “test”. But I know this because its says “Then I will take that test again” her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus. .And a vicious decision is drivin' me mad..Oh can you turn your back on such a great big fight?.Please leave me alone on this day..It was nice when it lasted,   But now it's gone..Edison came to stay."
" The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country..I was scared but it fel   Et..(spoken)   Uh, that hurt man   Alright   Perfect.Tears the past..Eloquence belongs,   To the conqueror..Sana'y di nagmaliw ang dati kong araw   Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay   Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal   Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan   Sana'y di nagmaliw ang dati kong araw   Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay   Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal   Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan   Refrain:   Sa aking pagtulog na labis ang himbing   Ang bantay ko'y tala, ang tanod ko'y bituin   Sa piling ni nanay, langit ay buhay   Puso kong may dusa sabik sa ugoy ng duyan   Sana'y di nagmaliw ang dati kong araw   Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay   Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal   Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan   Sa aking pagtulog na labis ang himbing   Ang bantay ko'y tala, ang tanod ko'y bituin   Sa piling ni nanay, langit ay buhay   Puso kong may dusa sabik sa ugoy ng duyan   Nais kong matulog sa dating duyan ko, inay   Oh!"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has “tear stains and puffy eyes” as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test..Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad   It cuts through the deepest parts of me   And fills up my mouth with words that I cry   How I'm still trying to stay inside   Hearts break and hearts wait   To make us grow from dust   Then our eyes cry and souls sigh   So that we know that it hurts   Our hearts break and hearts wait   To make us grow from dust   Then our eyes cry and souls sigh   So that we know that it hurts   Every now and then my memories ache   With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made   But as time goes on and my age gets older   I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain   'Cause heart break and hearts wait   To make us grow from dust   Then our eyes cry and souls sigh   So that we know that it hurts   Our hearts break and hearts wait   To make us grow from dust   Then our eyes cry and souls sigh   So that we know that it hurts   You know when to make me, I might just your heal   You know when to make me, I might just your heal   You know when to make me, I might just your heal   You know when to make me, I might just your heal.Rainy day, rain all day   Ain't no use in gettin' uptight   Just let it groove it's own way   Let it drain your worries away yeah   Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey   Lay back and dream on a rainy day   Lay back and groove on a rainy day   Lay back   Oh yeah!.But, but....If you ask me would I entertain the lions at the zoo   By singing in beside them just before their lunch was due   Would I do it?.(Who?)"
 The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom..Not a wookie   When you take it off   I'd love a lookie..The son of Israel.).Walk on that same beach   Like I did before..I got to keep it on the inside      I want to get lost   from my life sometimes      Sit on the side   and watch world go by      I want to get lost in the dark   and dream for awhile      Just sit inside a dark room   and dream for awhile      The only thing that ever makes   sense to me   Is the words to a song from   an American movie      The only thing that ever made   made sense in my life   Is the sound of my   little girl laughing   Alive and happy in   the summertime      I am just like everyone I know      I am afraid of things that I   don't know      I am afraid of ever really   being alone      I want to find myself a brand   new heart      I want to find a girl   and make a brand new start      I want to find a girl and get lost   in the dark      The only thing that ever makes   sense to me   Is the words to a song from   an American moive      The only thing that ever made   made sense in my life   Is the sound of my   little girl laughing   Through the window of a   summer night      I sit alone in the backyard   Wishing I could be inside      Just the sound of my   little girl laughing   Makes me happy just to be alive      Sometimes I am happy   just to be alive.For if i didn't love you   If i didn't love you   I wouldn't love at all.
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you’ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way..When the morning sunrise   Becomes a magic show   Before your very eyes   And all the sounds of life   Begin to harmonize   You hear a song of hope   Surround your senses   And feel the promise of a brand new kind of world   Lose your defenses   Unlock your mind   Unwind and follow me   Come let me help you see   How to find the way to leave yesterday behind      We should be together   When we're this close we're bound to work it out somehow   We found a dream to share   Don't lose it now   Just let my song of love   Surround your senses   And feel the promise of a brand new kind of world   Lose your defenses   Unlock your mind   You know I love you   (Love you)   Come let me show you   (show you)   How to find the way to leave yesterday behind.Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)   Here comes the sun, and I say   It's all right      Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter   Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here   Here comes the sun   Here comes the sun, and I say   It's all right      Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces   Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here   Here comes the sun   Here comes the sun, and I say   It's all right      Sun, sun, sun, here it comes   Sun, sun, sun, here it comes   Sun, sun, sun, here it comes   Sun, sun, sun, here it comes   Sun, sun, sun, here it comes      Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting   Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear   Here comes the sun   Here comes the sun, and I say   It's all right      Here comes the sun   Here comes the sun, and I say   It's all right   It's all right.My cheeks were reflecting the longest wavelength   My fan was folded up and grazing my forehead   And I kept touching my neck   To guide your eye to where I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone      My scars were reflecting the mist in your headlights   I looked like a neon zebra shaking rain off her stripes   And the rivulets had you riveted   To the places that I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone      And then we can do anything we want   And then we can do anything we want   And then we can do anything we want      We started out sipping the water   And now we try to swallow the wave   And we try not to let those bastards get us down   We don't worry anymore 'cause we know when the gulf comes we get brave   After all, look around   It's happening, it's happening, it's happenin' now      Let's pretend we're eight years old playing hookey   I'll draw on the wall and you can play U-F-C rookie   Then we'll grow up   Take our clothes off   And you remind me that I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone      And then we can do anything we want   And then we can do anything we want   And then we can do anything we want   And then we can do anything we want.Got a good reason   For taking the easy way out   Got a good reason   For taking the easy way out now      She was a day tripper   A one way ticket yeah   It took me so long to find out   But I found out      She's a big teaser   She took me half the way there   She's a big teaser   She took me half the way there now      She was a day tripper   A one way ticket yeah   It took me so long to find out   And I found out      Tried to please her   She only played one night stands   Tried to please her   She only played one night stands, now      She was a day tripper   A sunday driver yeah   Took me so long to find out   And I found out      Day tripper   Day tripper yeah      Day tripper   Day tripper yeah      Day tripper.If you've got a heartache   Of the kind that will not pass by   Even if you don't see the end   Of what lies around the bend   Don't stay that way   It's all in a day believe me   Even the best of dreams must end   Even so it grieves me   Stay loose, don't fight it   Let it take you all the way and   If it's wrong, you will right it   Do not waste these hours away   How many times have I told you   These are the tears I've shed   Could it be that I need help   Is it maybe I've come undone   And one thing more   You know it don't come easy   Even the best of friends must part   Even so it grieves me   Stay loose, don't fight it   Let love take a holiday   If it's wrong, you're gonna right it   Do not waste these hours away   Soon the storm will be over   And the clouds will all pass by   To be insane beyond belief   Is sometimes the best relief   And one thing sure   Love never did come easy   Even the best of dreams must end   Even so it grieves me   Stay loose, don't fight it   Let it take you all the way and   If it's wrong, you will right it   Do not waste these hours away   Stay loose, don't fight it   Let love take a holiday   If it's wrong, you're gonna right it   Do not waste these hours away"
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story..Wherever I am found,   Your memories still around..Never no more do I wonder,   Why you don't never play with me any more..I said yes, I said yes, I said yes,   I prayed a thousand times yes..Ik wil eens zien waar de mensen zijn   Ik wil eens zien hoe die mensen dansen   Zij lopen rond op die,   hoe noem je die?.The world is full of them."
"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""I’d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught..How sweet is life but we're crying   How mellow the wine but it's dry   How fragrant the rose but it's dying   How gentle the breeze but it sighs   What good is in youth when it's aging   What joy is in eyes that can't see   When there's sorrow in sunshine and flowers   And still only our rivers run free..Is it to   good to be secure?.They do it and then they do it again!.Well I'm gonna move baby   Well on the outskirts of town   Well I'm gonna move baby, yeah   Way back down on the outskirts of town, yeah      Well I don't need nobody else   Always hanging around   Yeah yeah, baby, oh oh      Well let me tell you baby   We're gonna move away from here   Well I don't need no ash mail   To buy, Lord I'm gonna buy you a fridge dare      Lord when we move   Way back down on the outskirts of town, yeah yeah   Well I don't need nobody else   Ah, worse hanging around   Oh, play your song, yeah      Love me babe      Yeah      Well let me tell you, baby   As funny as it seems   We're gonna have a dozen children   They're all, all gonna look like me   Lord, when we move, yeah, way back down   Way back down on the outskirts of town      Well I don't need nobody, yeah   Always hanging around   Yeah yeah, no   Yeah   Y'all.That's if you appreciate yourself."
" The concluding paragraph explains her next goal. She had to take a test but failed it. Paid over nineteen dollars for the plant. It reminded her of her old home. She will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also..Hela, heba, helloa..Slipped away from me..Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me   What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?.It is gone and I am free..You were there for me   Through the deepest valleys I was in   You have rescued me   Time and time again      You carried me   You are my god   Following your way is all I trust   My pure delight   You alone I give all my heart      Reff:   I've found all that I've been missing   In my god who died to cover my sins   Now I found my path for living   Since I believe in you      Bridge:   Consume me and breathe your love in me   Surround me you're all that I need   Now I found my path for living"
" The reason the author of the story “Winter hibiscus” ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don’t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner’s permit test. Also you can’t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up..You are part of the sum   What has been going on?.I won't let anyone blow it out, I'm gonna let it shine..Do you remember me   I sat upon your knee   I wrote to you   With childhood fantasies   Well, I'm all grown up now   Can you still help somehow      I'm not a child   But my heart still can dream   So here's my lifelong wish   My grown-up Christmas list   Not for myself   But for a world in need      No more lives torn apart   That wars would never start   And time would heal all hearts   Every man would have a friend      That right would always win   And love would never end   This is my grown-up   Christmas list   What is this illusion called      The innocence of youth   Maybe only in their blind belief   Can we ever find the truth   There'd be no more lives torn apart   And wars would never start      And time would heal all hearts   Every man would have a friend   And right would always win   And love would never end      This is my grown-up Christmas list   This is my only lifelong wish   This is my grown-up Christmas list.[Chorus]   Ain't no big deal to say I love you still   Call out my name   I'll be here   Ain't no big deal to say my love is real   When you reach out I'll be there      [Bridge]   Please don't be afraid to look me in the eye   Sad time is gone I got no tears to cry   Don't say you don't know I'm right   When I say we'll get by      [Chorus]      [Intermediate]   Nobody makes me feel the way that you do   Night time's such a thrill when I spend it with you   Ask me what is on my mind   So I can tell you true      [Ain't no big deal   My love is for real]   I love you still   [Ain't no big deal   My love is for real]   Ain't no big deal   I love you still   [Ain't no big deal   My love is for real]   Baby I love you still   [Ain't no big deal   My love is for real]   Ain't no big deal   Uh uh uh uh uh   Ain't no big thing   Uh uh uh uh   I said (first time only)   Ain't no big deal   Uh uh uh uh uh   Ain't no big thing   Uh uh uh uh      [Bridge]      [Intermediate]      [Reach out   Reach out]   I'll be there   Yeah   Oh yeah   [Reach out   Reach out]   I'll be there   Yeah   I'll be right by your side   [Reach out   Reach out]   I'll be there   Yeah   Oh yeah   [Reach out   Reach out]   I'll be there   Yeah.Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend   Loving the love I love      To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said   Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold   And in between what might have been and what has come to pass   A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass      Where do your golden rainbows end?"
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver’s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about “What happened with the driver’s test ,what was the point of that ?”..Into the masses turns to clay   Molded into what is now, the greater good   To close the story yesterday      Don't need to see your face,   Don't need to hear a word you say..Someone's got to help me get out of Louisiana, just to help me get to Houston town..I don't know what the answer is, but fair dues to you   A local lack of wisdom never stopped your being true   A drummer in the basement   A rhythm - roll at each hand's turn   Finding one thing you can believe in   Could seem like so much work   You've heard the cry before   Up and away we shall go   Tearing up the town   Tearing up the town   Hurry to dinner, son, the heat is on   Your daddy's in the oven and your mamma, she's gone   She went down to the clinic, but the news was not good   They told her it was nothing much, but she'd had quite enough   The ruins of a household, a loverboy who sits and stares   ""No, No"" she cried, ""I can't take it, I'm gonna go out somewhere""   You've heard the cry before   Up and away she goes   She's tearing up the town   Tearing up the town   Tearing up the town   Now we're really with it, comrades, now we're set   Ben Dolan's right behind us with the castanets   It took a lot of pleading, but he came here after all   And Ben's the very boy to take us right to where we want   Hey, look at them couples linking through the rainy streets   Someplace to be in love, the best there'll ever be   Oh sister sadness, get yourself behind me   Oh brother badness, why must you deny me?.I'm gonna buy an amplifier   And shout out ""Have you heard?"".When you hold me in the street   And you kiss me on the dance floor   I wish that it could be like that   Why can't it be like that?"
"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement..[Verse 2]   She's in my dreams when I sleep (yeahhh, yeah)   (Whoa oh) But when I wake she's gone so I weep (yeahhh, yeah)      [Chorus]   She's an angel   She's the girl, I want to share my dreams   She's an angel   I don't care if she can't fly over things   She's an angel   I don't care if ya can't see her wings   Watch her flyyyyyyyy, yeah, ohhh oh..There's no line if we just hide them..Sambora      If God was a woman      If God was a woman   With long blond hair   Would you kneel at her altar   And offer her prayer   Could she be your addiction   Could she make you sin   If God was a woman   And you were her man   If God was a woman   Would you be impressed   If she showed up in high heels   And a pretty red dress   Would you make a donation   Or would you draw the line   Would you yield to temptation   Or savor her wine   If God was a woman   Shed come like an angel   Or a devil in disguise   When she left in the morning   Would you lose your religion   Or kiss your faith goodbye, goodbye   If God was a woman..In the company of wolves I sat in silence   Observant and afraid   He was there with the eyes like glowing embers   The man you see was made, oh whoa whoa      I was low but now I am high   It helps to know serenity from ennui   Oh oh, something's wrong, something's wrong,   When it all remains the same   So face the fire, come into your name      In the company of wolves I sat in silence   Observant and afraid   He was there with the eyes like glowing embers   The man you see was made, oh whoa ooh      Even I can't recall how many days I had been out there for   But when all those lights cease to shine,   I was alive I think for the first time   Infinity it falls, in feathery folds   But she bites like loveless eyes,   And with her belly full she called this rite of passage,   It was the longest night of my life      It was the longest night of my life      Even I can't recall how many days I had been out there for   But when all those lights cease to shine,   I was alive I think for the first time   Infinity it falls, in feathery folds   But she bites like loveless eyes,   And with her belly full she called this rite of passage,   It was the longest night of my life      It was the longest night of my life.Well, who will you go to   When there's no-one to betray?"
"For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ‘’when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     .I bet you wouldn't think a dance   (Oh yeah Betty Jean)   Could start a real romance   (Oh yeah Betty Jean)   I bet you wouldn't think a kiss   (Oh yeah Betty Jean)   Could turn me on like this   (Oh yeah Betty Jean)   Well let me tell you how it was   (Oh yeah Betty Jean)   Yes it did, Yes it was.When the gulf between   All the things I need   And the things I receive   Is an ancient ocean   Wide, wild, lost, uncrossed   Still I maintain there's nothing   Wrong with you   You do all that you do   Because it's all you can do   Well, I was fifteen   Where could I go?.Yea, my eyes are burning in my head   And seeing only red   And wishing you were dead      Is this love?.Sometimes,   You wake up in the morning with the bass line,   A ray of sunshine,   Sometimes,   You know today you're gonna have a good time,   And you're ready to go..In love with you   How am I supposed to do everything?"
"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: “I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does..The time is short now..Do you recall a girl that's been in nearly every song?.Man!.His girl by his side   And the lights turned low   He just says, let it snow, let it snow   I don't care      Oh, the weather outside is frightful   But that fire is, mmm, delightful   Since we've no place to go   Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow      It doesn't show signs of stopping   And I've brought lots of corn for popping   The lights are turned way down low   So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow   Let it snow      When we finally say good night   How I'll hate going out in the storm   But if you'll only hold me tight   All the way home I'll be warm      Fire is slowly dying   And, my dear, we're still good-bying   Long as you love me so   Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.Dumb-dee-dumb-dee-dumb-ooh-yeah-yeah,   Dumb-dee-dumb-dee-dumb-ooh-yeah-yeah,   Oh, I'm hurtin'."
"In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted..I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me,   Swich-e-rooney..Autographs now and again   People who saw you on blankety blank   Or in the bank   Your fifteen minutes start now.It's the end of the night..Mine eyes are dim, I cannot see,   I have not brought my specs with me,   I have not brought my specs with me!.Do you want to play house, do you want to play house   Playin in the house, playin in the house of love      Call me over, call me over the top   And Ill say yeah!"
"Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower..All the precious moments..I got a great big dick   So anyone who can't adjust   Gets rust      And then bites the dust   Be ready to walk a mile   'Cause I'll smack that cool-Aid smile   As I Cramp your style (style...style)   Cramp your style (cramp your style...cramp your style).Does anyone remember the great depression?.'Cause some day she'll go off and find a life of her own   Marry a good man   And make a happy home   Until she comes back and sees with those same eyes   What time can not diskise      She walks through the door with that look on her face   Cause daddys' brown hair has all turned to gray   They talk for hours they cry and they laugh   Watchin' old movies and thinkin' back   And just as she turns to go   She says, ""hey dad, how bout 1 for the road""      ""Dance me!.It is just above Lake Simcoe, by Lake Couchiching."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said “Then I will take that tes again”, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don’t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season”. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she’ll do great..The universe is at Your feet   Gives You praise   Evermore   The stars will light the sky for You   Always   God be praised   And we sing   The Lord is on high   The Lord is on high      I adore You   I adore You   And there's none that compares   To Your majesty O Lord   I adore You   I adore You   And I stand   In wonder of Your love      We will crown You   King forever   Living Saviour   Jesus Redeemer   Lord of Heaven   Robed in majesty   Crowned in glory   Creation adores You      Holy Holy   God almighty   And forever the Lord is exalted   Hear the angels   Shout His anthem   Ever-living   God we adore You.Hiding from the day,   I can't bare it,   Cannot tame the hunger in me      Oh, I say I did it,   Always searching,   You can't fuck with me..Mama told me when I was young   Come sit beside me, my only son   And listen closely to what I say..Amazes me how you can bring us all together..know!"
"The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life..Say you'll be mine my whole life through!.All my my friends are happy to stay   Here in this yard day after day   But something inside me has called me away   I don't understand but I know I can't stay      I'm gonna fly   No one knows where   But I'm gonna fly   I'm lighter than air      Cause I have felt for the first time   I can be myself   No more faces to hide behind   Just a smile and a dream that's mine   Even if I am the only one who wants to fly      I'm gonna fly   No one knows where   But I'm gonna fly   I soar through the air      All of my life seems I've waited   For the time to start   Being the person inside of me   Unafraid of being me   No more faces to hide behind   Just a smile and a dream that's mine   Even if I'm the only one who wants to fly      If I had my life to live over again   I'd run bare foot, relax a bit more   And I'd talk to more children   And I'd learn how they laugh   And I'd teach them how I've learned to fly      I'm gonna fly   No one knows where   But I'm gonna fly   I'm lighter than air      I'm gonna fly   No one knows where   But I'm gonna fly   I soar through the air      Cause all of my life seems I've waited   For the time to start   Being the person inside of me   Unafraid of being me   Even if I'm the only one who wants to fly   I'm gonna fly.(Listen close I won't say this again)      [Chorus]      I'm sorry for changing..Did she go to work or just go to the store?.I stand up for my pride   I don't wanna be just like anyone   In this world I cannot hide   I must finish what I have begun      That's the way I play   In the modern day   'Cause I wanna stay   In the modern day      Got a picture in my mind   Of the way that I wanna be   So I search until I find   The power inside of me      It's another phase   Of the modern day      Gotta face up to this life   Can't let it get the best of me   So I make a sacrifice   If that's the way it has to be      I'm doin' what I feel is right   I'm ready if I need to fight      In the modern way   In the modern day      Gotta face up to this life   Can't let it get the best of me   If I make a sacrifice   That's the way it has to be      Like a motor in overdrive   I feel good and I feel alive   I got no need to beg or borrow   Got a shortcut to tomorrow      And I'm on my way   To the modern day   Got a lot to say   In the modern day      'Cause I need to stay   In the modern day      In the modern day"
"Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, “… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. .And somewhere in the darkness there we found a brand new start   As I took every word she whispered straight to heart   When she said      Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me   Hold me, hold me like you want me   Like you'll never let me go?.Am I who I think I am?.Your pathetic war will finish even before it's begun,   We've taken Charles prisoner, the Roundheads have won!.New York City was a stitch in time   When I stood all I could of L.A.   Patchin' up the pieces of my tangled mind   Diggin' somethin' different every day, yeah   Soon as I was better, I was movin' on   Gettin' it together, gettin' good and gone   And by gettin' by high, good and high and strange   Gonna get some strange   New ain't nothin' but a state of mind   Keeps a man from missin' what he left behind   I'll take anything that I can find   Anyhow anywhere anyway anytime   I'll keep livin' till the day I die as long as I can   Get it up for one more try   Gettin' by gettin' by high good and high and strange   Gonna get some strange   New ain't nothin' but a state of mind   Gettin' by good and high and strange   Gonna get some strange.Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops."
" I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won’t give up if they don’t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life..Lucky me   I guessed the kind of man   That you would turn out to be   Now I wish that I'd been wrong and then   I could remember to breathe   And all along the watchtower   The night horses and the black mares   Ready themselves for the outcome   For the strange times upon us      But what you didn't count on   Was another mother of   A mother revolution   But what you didn't count on   Was another mother of   A mother revolution   You could've have me   You could've have me   You could've have me   Right there beside you   You could've have me boy   You could've have me yeah   You could've have me   Right there beside you      A wife on loan in a cafe   In old El Paso   Next I go to   Seven Gates and my sister's Bass Bonanza   And all along her watchtower   The night horses and the black mares   Steady themselves for the outcome   For the strange days upon us      What you didn't count on   Was another mother of   A mother revolution.Can't you see I'm no good without you?.Shake it up!.Baby, you said,   Long as rivers flow   Each day you'd love me more..quick,   These we hate him, these are past us, huh   Always fighting for the position of top dog   That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog   Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine   But I'm always having to proove myself, time after time   Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast   Judged from the past and he's put last   And bluffing with nothing to say, stutterin and slurrin   And mutterin words with no meaning, attack me side I'm like Danny Kane   Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin   And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please   I've got a craving      [Scratched sample until end] - ""I'm the man"""
"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn’t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start..Queen, queen of the rodeo   Queen, queen of the rodeo.Get your motor runnin'   Head out on the highway   Lookin' for adventure   And whatever comes our way      Yeah darlin' go make it happen   Take the world in a love embrace   Fire all of your guns at once   And explode into space      I like smoke and lightning   Heavy metal thunder   Racin' with the wind   And the feelin' that I'm under      Yeah darlin' go make it happen   Take the world in a love embrace   Fire all of your guns at once   And explode into space      Like a true nature's child   We were born, born to be wild   We can climb so high   I never wanna die      Born to be wild   Born to be wild.I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do it,   Sweet banana, you've never been done..And I guess I've come to live here in your eyes..There's a gap in between   There's a gap where we meet   Where I end and you begin      And I'm sorry for us   The dinosaurs roam the earth   The sky turns green   Where I end and you begin   (4, 5, 6, 7)      I am up in the clouds   I am up in the clouds   And I can't, and I can't come down      I can watch and not take part   Where I end and where you start   Where you, you left me alone   You left me alone      X will mark the place   Like the parting of the waves   Like a house falling in the sea   In the sea      I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive      And there'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies      I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive      And there'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies      I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive      And there'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies   There'll be no more lies      I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive   I will eat you alive"
" The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting she chooses to try. and make their wew home work out. After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes..It'd be just another river town   Streets would have a different sound   There'd be no honky tonks with whiskey rounds   No dreamers chasin' dreams down      No tourists takin' in the sights   No stetsons under broadway lights   No pickers playin' for pocket change   No rhinestone boots on an old church stage      Hey blue eyes, cryin' in the rain   Hey fire, burnin' round the ring   Hey crazy, you know it's true   That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you      No ghost of the man in black   No long white cadillac   No woman standin' by her man   In the place where it all began      Hey good lookin', hey momma tried   Hey gambler, hey country boy can survive   Hey jolene, you know it's true   That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you      Hey georgia, hey smokey mountain rain   Hey galveston, he stopped loving her today   Hey fancy, you know it's true   That nashville, wouldn't have   Blue eyes, cryin' in the rain   Hey fire, burnin' round the ring   Hey crazy, you know it's true   That nashville, wouldn't be nashville, without you      It'd be just another river town   Streets would have a different sound.She is livin' far away from a lonely man in the San Francisco Bay,   He is dreamin' hard of a girl all claid in bad plaid and mad at the whole world,   All her friends they are blessed impressed intelligent freaks,   All of them are six feet tall all of them are hateful to me,   She sleeps alone and wet with her phone in her face all tied up in her old bed,   She walks alone everyday up and down the rainy streets in her own weird way,   All her friends they are blessed impressed intelligent freaks,   All of them are six feet tall all of them are hateful to me,   Hateful, yeah they're hateful to me,   Hateful, yeah they're hateful to me,   Hateful, yeah they're hateful to me,   Hateful,   Getting very hateful.What happened to Eddie, Paul, and Bruce?.I'll put a lid on it   I'll put a lid down on it   Save it for another night.Aww, but it don't make no difference, baby, no, no,   And I know that I could always try."
"The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, “I just stared at the hibiscus,” this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready..It was there for the first time   I could see it by the look in your eyes   You're so shy, but I know you want me   Your desire will not be denied..In The Name Of Love   Before you break my heart      Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go   Each time you leave my door   I watch you walk down the street   Knowing your other love you'll meet   This time before you run to her   Leaving me alone and hurt   (Think it over) After I've been good to you?.How many more songs have I gotta write?.If I seem a little distant   Maybe I'm outta sight   If everytime we speak   You seem to draw a blank   It's the ghost of my ex-friends   That you have to thank      If I lack a certain etiquette   Break all the social laws   This door is off it's hinges now   But the choice is yours..But I'm going to meet the one I love   So please don't stand in my way   Because I'm going to meet the one I love   No, Mamma, let me go!"
"The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, “In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  .No, I don't think we are!.The wind is whistling,   The wind is whistling   Through the house..I better tell her that I love her   Before she does it all over again   Oh God, she's killing me!!!.Above the sun go round and round till the moon comes out   You are my Immortal, you will live forever      Just come and join my side, I'm letting you in..Listen to the color of your dreams..."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story..Come with me   Which way is up?.We've laid the cables and the wires   We've split the wood and stoked the fires   We've lit our town so there is no   Place for crime to hide   Our little church is painted white   And in the safety of the night   We all go quiet as a mouse   For the word is out   That God is in the house   God is in the house   God is in the house   No cause for worry now   God is in the house   Moral sneaks in the White House   Computer geeks in the school house   Drug freaks in the crack house   We don't have that stuff here   We have a tiny little Force   But we need them of course   For the kittens in the trees   And at night we are on our knees   As quiet as a mouse   For God is in the house   God is in the house   God is in the house   And no one's left in doubt   God is in the house   Homos roaming the streets in packs   Queer bashers with tire-jacks   Lesbian counter-attacks   That stuff is for the big cities   Our town is very pretty   We have a pretty little square   We have a woman for a mayor   Our policy is firm but fair   Now that God is in the house   God is in the house   God is in the house   Any day now he will come out   God is in the house   Well-meaning little therapists   Goose-stepping twelve-stepping Tetotalltarianists   The tipsy, the reeling and the drop down pissed   We got no time for that stuff here   Zero crime and no fear   We've bred all our kittens white   So that you can see them in the night   And at night we're on our knees   As quiet as a mouse   Since the word got out   From the North down to the South   For no-one's left in doubt   There's no fear about   If we all hold hands and very quietly shout   Hallelujah   God is in the house   God is in the house   Oh I wish he would come out   God is in the house.How can a poor boy when you don't believe a thing that's true, for you   When you don't believe a thing, nothing that's true for you   How can a poor boy ever get next to you?.You should care for me!.I swear on the stars above I do!"
"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different..It's in your eyes, what's on your mind..I do it all right   You wanna know how I do it   I do it all right   I got a hole and I'll never go home   There ain't nothing can fill it up   I got a hole and I'll never go home   There ain't no one thing   A new road, a new road   A new road, a new road   You never get right back   A new road   You never get it right back   A new road   You wanna know how I do it?.When the snowman brings us snow   Well he just might like to know   He's put a great big smile, on someone elses face   If you jump into your bed   Quickly cover up your head   Don't you lock the doors   You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way      Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day   When the kids start singing and the band begins to play   Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day   Let the bells ring out for Christmas      When we're skating in the park   If the snow cloud makes it dark   Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way   Now the frosty paws appear   And they've frozen up my beard   So we'll lie by the fire   'Til the heat simply melts 'em all away      Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day   When the kids start singing and the band begins to play   Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day   So let the bells ring out for Christmas      When the snowman brings the snow (when the snowman brings the snow)   Well he just might like to know (well he just might like to know)   He's put a great big smile on somebody's face   So if Santa brings that sleigh (Santa brings that sleigh)   All along the Milky Way (along the Milky Way)   I'll sign my name on the rroftop in the snow   Then he may decide to stay      Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day   When the kids start singing and the band begins to play   Oo-oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day   So let the bells ring out for Christmas      Okay you lot - take it!.And when will mom stop kissing me   In front of all my friends?.Get ready   It's courtin' time!"
"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again”. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better..But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin',   Off the wall, that's all..You a tramp, Otis..Faster, faster, to welcome disaster..It's gonna be like starting all over again   I gotta get used to you   I gotta get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I got to get used to you, again   You know I love to feel you   Reach the depth of my heart   Deep inside of me   The way it used to do   I've had so many lovers   No-one could ever tame me   They all seem to rub me the wrong way   They always get my back up   No-one seems to do the things that you do for me   And now that you're back in my life again   I gotta get used to you   I gotta get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I got to get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I gotta get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I got to get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I gotta get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I got to get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I gotta get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I got to get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I gotta get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I got to get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I gotta get used to you, again   I gotta get used to you   I got to get used to you, again.Fill me like the mountains, yeah, yeah, yeah,   Fill me like the sea, Lord,   Not coming past, still at last      Lord!"
"The story like this for mine reasons. First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that..No more sleepy dreaming..Be on your way..Give me more time, I gotta have more time..Go to sleep, little Earth..Sometime world, pass me by again,   Carry you, carry me, away."
"The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion..Howard: Get out of here, you creep, you used to live in his house!.Headcase baby   She's a cool kind of crazy   Wild and she's willing   Into early Dylan      She drives me crazy,   Oh yeah, ooh ooh yea      When I look into her big brown eyes   I'm so glad to know she's mine   My little headcase, yeah Ooh, ooh,   Yeah, my little headcase, yeah   Ooh, ooh, yeah      Heidi is a headcase, a rebel and a rouser   Cranks up her Rickenbacker   Blasts away for hours   What's she doin' now on the escalator   Snorting up some speed on the picture of or Stiv Bators      What 'cha doin'?.Goodbye..Me and Claudeen at the Seven Eleven   Smokin in the back, in our mini skirts   Take us back to class, so we look like heaven   You say I'm so fine that it hurts      I'm on the fire but what can I do,   I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you   I'll be outside pick me up after school   In your thunder black, baby blue   Thunder black, baby blue   Baby blue      Baby if you want to join our entourage   Paint your face on it here we go   Letting on keepin' on so dangerous   Keeping it cool yeah god knows   Riding around town blue and leather   Walking them streets like the queen of hearts   Laughing at nothin' be alone together   ??.But there's someone whose love is real."
"  The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up..Up on the white veranda   She wears a necktie and a Panama hat..Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na..Am I still mine?.Well Jerry at de mike come fe Demonstrate   Yes, Jerry at de mike me come fe Demonstrate   Me come fe show de crowd a people dat great is great   Right ya now Mr Jerry at go set tings straight   No MC test Jerry in a ate!.All the strangers walk like you tonight."
" I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts..So keep thinkin you the man   Cause its all part of my plan      I-I-I'm ready for ya.I'm glad I got to see you once again   Although we're through I still love you   I guess I'll have to call you just a friend   'Cause someone new has just stepped in   I try to say that I don't really miss you   But in my heart I know it's just a lie   And if someday his love should prove untrue   I'll be around when he has said goodbye   (I try to say that I don't really miss you)   But in my heart I know it's just a lie   And if someday his love should prove untrue   I'll be around when he has said goodbye   (Goodbye).See that girl who's smiling so brightly,   Well I reckon she's cool and I reckon rightly,   She's good looking and I ain't frightened,   I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning..He calls us to offer up ourselves a living sacrifice...Westward leading, still proceeding,   Guide with thy perfect light."
"I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that..Life was a ball and you took it all,   We took a fall,   You were the doubt   You won't bail us out,there's no use to shout,Your dying!.How long till there's no denying   We're out of time?.Let 'em shine on..It's difficult..Ooooooo!"
" because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place.The winter season of the year,   When to this world our Lord was born,   The ox and donkey, so they say,   Did keep his holy presence warm..To want someone for all your own and not to share their love..It burned, burned, burned....And feel a change already beginning..(Yeah that's the super bass)   Boom-badoom boom, boom badoom-boom?"
" The auther mad it seem like he did not like it but he loved flowers and he like working in the syr wit the people his mom is anierpaady he liked to see him togod wit his life that come back becus thay liked the place..Cuz u used to be the one   Who asked me to let her be      So you're the one   Who want us   To get back   (You say lets get back together)   (Lets get back forever)   Now it's u the one   Whos's followin me around   Like a homeless dog   And you pray   (Let's get back together, let's get back for better)   Get back   Lets lets lets   Get back   (Back, back, back...)      Now your the one   Whos chasing me   Everywhere I go   Ur all I see   It's like ur following me everywhere   I used to pray for that to happen   But now I just don't care   It's more   It's startin to annoyme   I'm gettin crazy   It's gettin chaotic      So baby now   Ur the one who's looking for me   I wonder why?.Love is gonna find you and set you free   Somebody's waiting there to catch you   You don't have to be afraid now baby..I realized that nothing else will satisfy me   I'm so glad I found you   Now that I'm changed, no one can keep me away from you      Uh oh, uh uh oh (oh oh)   Uh oh, uh uh oh (oh oh)   Uh oh, uh uh oh (oh oh)   Uh oh, uh uh oh (oh oh).As I was going down I throwed up my hands,   Saying, ""Please Lord, take me on dry land."".All those numbers!"
" The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away..It's nothing to see   But something's got you down on your knees   I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts   And it ain't falling down by degrees   I think I'm gonna die   From trying to kick a hole in the sky   Trying to kick a hole in the sky   Trying to kick a hole in the sky   From trying to kick a hole in the sky   Oh, bring it on!.I cry for you oh my lord, (sing for me)   My kingdom of lust is yours (oh, sing for me)   Bonded by love we are one, you are the moon and I am the sun.When they went to bed that night, no one would have believed   That in the morning light would not be there   The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man   No place was there known to have been spared   Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone   The day the light went out of the daytime sky      Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom   Nothing out of reach could be observed   Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day   Who hit him no one knew, or whom he hit   Cars were caught in pileups and the planes could never land   The day the light went out of the daytime sky      ""Now I can rest here after my journey   Now I can feed here before I continue."".The thrill, the desire, the excitement is gone   We seem to have found a safe comfort zone   We worked so hard to get where we are   That romance got lost on the way      It used to be never enough   We'd melt with each look and each burning touch   We laughed and we loved and we just ate it up   Back when we were hungry that way      Let's love like we're hungry again   Bring back the passion we had back then   The time has gone by, we forgot what it meant   Lets love like we're hungry again      Don't you miss those feelings we had at the start   And that fire that got started from each little spark   Oh it's good where we are, but I miss where we've been   Lets love like we're hungry again, now and then      Lets love like we're hungry again   Bring back the passion we had back then   The time has gone by, now we've grown too content   Lets love like we're hungry again, now and then   Lets love like we're hungry again.Follow my every step take notes   On how I creep I's bout ta go in deep   This is the way I creep my season   Here's my ghetto rep I kept to say   The least no no it can't cease so I   Begin to piece my two and two together   Gots no snowy weather have to   Find something to do better bet!"
"The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again..Lady Yellow Stamper with a fillet in a hamper   Dying to finish the course,   Goodies for the table with a fable on the label   Drowning in miracle sauce..Only you know      Looking for   The solution   You hold the key   Deep inside   The solution   Set yourself free      Round and round we go   Round and round we go      Giving in, giving out   Do the best you can do   Giving in, giving out   It's all up to you      Giving in, giving out   Do the best you can do   Giving in, giving out   It's all up to you      It's all up to you   It's all up to you.""What kept you so long?"".It was Paradise Valley, Nevada,   Not far from where the west was won..Wading the stream that flows in between you and I, once in a dream."

"I think the authour chose to end the story this way to show that the girl is remembering her past and being at, ease. with the flower she at a since of peace. The writer wants to convey that no matter what your used to you can find something that can bring you happiness and a since of focus..Personally I know the alley   Where Jack feeds on the birds of night   Not even bubbies on bicycles 2x2   Can stop the blood and feathers flying      Waring overalls and for once and for all   What is the dream?.Oh, what a night!.Don't you feel it growin', day by day   People gettin' ready for the news   Some are happy, some are sad   Got to let the music play      What the people need   Is a way to make 'em smile   Ain't so hard to do if you know how      Gotta get a message   Get it on through   Got to let the music play   Let the music play   Let the music play      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time   Let the music play      Well I know, you know better, everything I say   Meet me in the country for a day   We'll be happy and we'll dance   We're gonna dance the blues away      If I'm feelin' good to you and you're feelin' good to me   There ain't nothin' we can't do or say   Feelin' good, feelin' fine   Gonna let the music play   Let the music play   Let the music play      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   (Oh, yeah)   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   (Don't it make you feel good)   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time      Like a lazy flowing river   Surrounding castles in the sky   The crowd is getting bigger   Listenin' for the happy sounds   I've got to let them fly      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time   (Listen to the music, now)      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time      Music is my sanctuary   Music is my life   Music is my sanctuary   Music is my life      Music is my sanctuary   Music is my life   Music is my sanctuary   Music is my life.So I said   Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may      What about Livingstone?.Old 61's my number on the hi-way   I'm turnin' up the V's on the airways   I'm tuned into some bad-ass transactions   It's the only way to get my satisfaction      Yeah antenna head, yeah antenna head      Antenna waves be burnin' up my radio   Mister DJ say it's the only way to go   Cranked up all the way my tube is turnin4 red   Got a pocket full uh cornbread just call it   Antenna head      Yeah antenna head   Yeah antenna head   Yeah yeah yeah antenna head   Yeah antenna head      Yeah antenna head   Yeah antenna head   Yeah yeah yeah antenna head   Yeah antenna head"
" The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story..Always love....You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave..Hello little Suzie, hello little Suzie   Can I walk home with, can I walk home with you ?.And all the ladies sing,   So, oh, oh oh oh..Quite some time, I been sittin' it out   Didn't take no chances, I was a prisoner of doubt   I knocked down the wailin' wall, it ain't no sin   I, got, the feel of fortune, deal me in      [Chorus]   I'm comin' straight on for you   You made my mind   Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through,   Straight on, straight on for you,   Straight on for you      Now, I know, I got to play my hand   What the winner don't know, the gambler understands   My heart keeps playin' it through with you, my friend   I'll take my chances on you, again and again, again      [Chorus]"
" Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think at se was wereing about it doing spring because she whent to wacth the geese fly in a u shape and she whent to see the plant grow but the snow don’t melt yet. She started takeing to herself about it but she could whant to take at test doing spring. At if she can passed it again because she doesn’t like to take the test over and over again. When every body gets to the diffent thing after thee test is over..Can you love me for good   The way you thought you could?.No way!.We said we'd walk together baby come what may   That come the twilight should we lose our way   If as we're walkin a hand should slip free   I'll wait for you   And should I fall behind   Wait for me      We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side   We'd help each other stay in stride   But each lover's steps fall so differently   But I'll wait for you   And if I should fall behind   Wait for me      Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true   But you and I know what this world can do   So let's make our steps clear that the other may see   And I'll wait for you   If I should fall behind   Wait for me      Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead   There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed   Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees   I'll wait for you   And should I fall behind   Wait for me   Darlin' I'll wait for you   Should I fall behind   Wait for me.(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)   Cause we can do it!.This morning as I watched a bird   Just spread its wings and fly   It was then a thought came over me   And I wondered why can't I   Oh why, oh why can't I?"
"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now” & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas..Doodlin', can you doodle?.You'd better keep her..through my brain   Baby baby don't cry      They're part of the scheme   Nature always is   Physical it seems   We don't have a (basement)   Something isn't right   Baby baby don't cry      Scamper throught the night   Our little ears alert   (????????????).Have yourself a Merry little Christmas   Let your heart be light   From now on our troubles will be out of sight      Have yourself a Merry little Christmas   Make the yuletide gay   From now on our troubles will be miles away      Once again as in olden days   Happy golden days of yore   Faithful friends who are dear to us will be near to us once more      Through the years we all will be together   If the fates allow   Hanging a shining star upon the highest bough   And have yourself a Merry little Christmas now.Do you, do you, do you want to dance?"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that’s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons..Who have loved, that's now departed   I know I've got to find   Some kind of peace of mind      Nothing's gonna stop me now   I'll find a way somehow   I'll be lookin' everywhere   I know I'm gonna find a way.Here comes that sinking feeling..Cute..Little by little, step by step   We were called the dirty pets   Heart to heart, side by side   Love will never hide.We got stranded, caught in the crossfire   We got stranded, caught in the crossfire   We got stranded, caught in the crossfire   Stranded, caught in the crossfire   Help me."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring..Ohhhh Ohhhh      Late at night you call on the phone   We talk about the day   When you found out he was cheating   You tell me that it hurts to the bone   To trust someone that way   To find out he was decieving   And I know I've always just been your friend   But if you look my way I'll make sure that you'll never hurt again      Do you know I exist   Just to promise you this   Endlessly to be true to you   And if you answer my prayer   I'd cross my heart and I'd swear   Endlessly to be true to you   And if you'd only see   How beautiful you and I would be   Endlessly      Ohhh ohh yea   I remember when you fell in love   I could not believe   That it was not with me   I said a secret prayer up above   And put my heart away   So that you could be free   And I know right now your broken in two   But did you know my hearts been broken since the day i met you      Do you know I exist   Just to promise you this   Endlessly to be true to you   And if you answer my prayer   I'd cross my heart and I'd swear   Endlessly to be true to you   And in my sweetest dream you'd learn to put your faith in me   Endlessly      Sometimes the thing you need is the one thing you can't see   If you put your faith in me   How beautiful you and I would be         Do you know I exist   Just to promise you this   Endlessly to be true to you   And if you answer my prayer   I'd cross my heart and I'd swear (I'd swear)   Endlessly to be true to you   And if you'd only see   How beautiful you and I would be   Endlessly.(Who?).Dressed in purple velvets   With a flower in her hair   Feel her gentle spirit   As the champa fills the air      She wears rubys on her fingers   Tiny bells upon her toes   She's the finest thing   I've ever seen   Love that ring inside her nose      Flower Child yeah   Flower Child yeah      She's a psychedelic princess   On a magic carpet ride   And where her trip will carry you   Is somewhere you can't find      She's on a plane of higher consciousness   Meditation is the key   She's got her shit together   'Cause her soul and mind are free      Flower Child yeah   Flower Child yeah      She's a child of Martin Luther   As a freedom fighter she   Speaks of liberation on the land   And on the sea   Her eyes are made of sunshine   And her lips are jelly sweet      Flower Child yeah   Flower Child yeah.So take your share   Of the gifts that are there,   They all belong to you   And, come what may,   At the break of each day,   We all begin anew once more..Who knows what he may bring to me?"
" The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test..What to do now I don't know      Something's calling me back   It's a light in the black   Am I ready to go?.Flowers and beads are one thing,   But havin' you girl, that's something..Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,   But I know that my faith will lead me on..On my way home, police car pulled me over..They tried to catch us dancin' on the line   They say we took it way too far this time   They gave us no breaks here   But we made our own I swear      I do, I do believe in you   After all that we've been through   I do, I do believe in you   And everything that we do      We used to run with the dangerous crowd   Where the flame was hot and burnin' out   We knew we'd have to give   It hit us where we lived      I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)   After all that we've been through together   You took away my darkest nights (nights)   No one else could see the light      Runnin' blind day after day   Some things never want to change, oh, oh   We knew we'd have to give   It hit us where we lived      I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)   After all that we've been through   You took away my darkest nights (nights)   No one else could see the light      I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)   After all that we've been through   You took away my darkest nights (nights)   No one else could see the light ..."
" I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without no friends just let in her mom.Neche ruach, mistaleach verafeh   Ramaz li: ""od efshar lichyot!"".I should have known when you first started   Runnin' away before my eyes..Why you behaving this way?.Don't you feel it growin', day by day   People gettin' ready for the news   Some are happy, some are sad   Got to let the music play      What the people need   Is a way to make 'em smile   Ain't so hard to do if you know how      Gotta get a message   Get it on through   Got to let the music play   Let the music play   Let the music play      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time   Let the music play      Well I know, you know better, everything I say   Meet me in the country for a day   We'll be happy and we'll dance   We're gonna dance the blues away      If I'm feelin' good to you and you're feelin' good to me   There ain't nothin' we can't do or say   Feelin' good, feelin' fine   Gonna let the music play   Let the music play   Let the music play      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   (Oh, yeah)   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   (Don't it make you feel good)   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time      Like a lazy flowing river   Surrounding castles in the sky   The crowd is getting bigger   Listenin' for the happy sounds   I've got to let them fly      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time   (Listen to the music, now)      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time      Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   Oh, oh, oh listen to the music   All the time      Music is my sanctuary   Music is my life   Music is my sanctuary   Music is my life      Music is my sanctuary   Music is my life   Music is my sanctuary   Music is my life.But I'm lost   Take me away!"
"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added “hibiscus is budding.” Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it..Here it comes again   That old familiar pain   Here it comes again   Now it has a name   What am I to do?.Who do you think you are?.I'm waking up to ash and dust   I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust   I'm breathing in the chemicals      I'm breaking in, shaping up   Then checking out on the prison bus   This is it, the apocalypse   Whoa      I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones   Enough to make my systems blow   Welcome to the new age, to the new age   Welcome to the new age, to the new age   Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive   Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive      I raise my flags, don my clothes   It's a revolution, I suppose   We'll paint it red to fit right in   Whoa   I'm breaking in, shaping up   Then checking out on the prison bus   This is it, the apocalypse   Whoa      I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones   Enough to make my systems blow   Welcome to the new age, to the new age   Welcome to the new age, to the new age   Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive   Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive      All systems go, sun hasn't died   Deep in my bones, straight from inside      I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones   Enough to make my systems blow   Welcome to the new age, to the new age   Welcome to the new age, to the new age   Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive   Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive.Bet you want a piece of me   Do you like what you see?.Now can you feel me?"
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won’t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point..Abrasion can wear you away..Hai!.And now that I can put this down,   If I had known what I know now,   I never would have played so nonchalant..Hold on to your love..Made the deadline and you passed the test   Sabotage seems safer than success   Put it off until tomorrow   I've hear it all before      But it's one on one, one on one   It's you and me against the world   It's one on one      I need some time to think the whole thing over   You say you want to save the world alone   I want to taste and test the waters with you   It's not so easy when you're on your own      Don't lie to me is all i ask of you   No excuses i just want the truth   Reputation is a fragile thing   I know you know it, well it's   One on one, one on one   It's you and me against the world   It's one on one      One on one, one on one   It's you and me against the world   It's one on one"
"I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more..I was right to fall in love this way   And one thing's for sure   The angels smiled on me   When you came my way   So my dear, tonight's the night   It's gonna be special   I can't wait to see the face of my love      But even though I tried, sorry I was late   And I understand that you couldn't wait   But you're pulling back, honey I can see   And it makes me worry   Are you mad at me?.The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home      Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong   Don't you think nineteen is too young   To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?.You know there has never been another,   Someday she'll find out the lie..Let there be Cuckoos, a lark and a dove,   But first of all please, let there be love   Love.. ooh.. love.. let there be love.You ask how long I'll love you   It's hard to explain but I'll try   Tell me how long has the sun been shining   Above us in the sky?"
"In the story, “winter hibiscus”, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds he so much of her home. The reason why the author conclude the story with that saying was because it gave her a goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she @MONTH1 believe that the Hibiscus is good luck so she sets a goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories. In conclusion, certain things can trigger your memories, but its the good memories that make things in life something to wait and hope for..Mama said ""come on in this kitchen, daddy, 'cause I'm good and ready   Come on and get it!"".All the vampires come out at night to play....Oh we will all burn together when we burn..Oh Mr Pleasant, how is Mrs Pleasant?.What?"
" The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope .Saeng hod been hurt anddissappointed but in the end she had shown hope in the story Saeng failedher driving test. She was very disappointed . In The endit  showed she was not going to quit in this new country . She was going to move on and make the best of what she has..I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,   I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,   I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,   Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,   But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,   That it might as well be spring,   It might as well be, might as well be,   It might as well be spring..No I didn't even know her name,   But I'm never gonna be the same..Chocolate Rain!.I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,   And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill..the remote."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try keep her next plant. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again because she sold the plant to somebody. Saeng has seed the plant before as a child and that's why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try and keep her next plant. .Johnny went to frosted flake   To go for a walk in the frozen wood   He bumped into a mushroom   That sold his body for some warm food   ""Eat me my friend, you'll be the leader of the band""   Johnny's hand reached out   Luckily there was Mr Doubt   Mr Doubt the old man was the surveyor   Of frosted flake wood   He tried to sell hesitation wherever he could   ""Buy some doubt""   Feel free he yelled loud   ""Friends it won't hurt""   Luckily there was big bird   For God's sake run away   Or it won't be your lucky day   Leave this forest behind   This ain't a place for human kind.I don't care what you do   just so long as it ain't me and you..[Chorus]   What a life, gets better as it goes along   What a life, gets better as it goes along   Been in love, been left standing till I said is that what I want,   Oh no there's got to be another smile on my face   I don't care about the money I make or what it can do   I'm alive and that's what's important to me   I don't need someone to tell me you'll get along, you'll get along   Who to love who to watch over me      [Chorus]      There's an old man been calling me for a long time   I'm never able to get his face off my mind   He always said to me take it easy take it easy   And all the things you want will come easy, will come easy..It's yours      Next time we fuck, I don't want to fuck, I want to make love   Next time we talk, I don't want to just talk, I want to trust   Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you   And next time I spend I want it all to be for you   Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend   Guess who's it is?.And you, mysterious beauty, long and blond flowing tresses   How your eyes are sky-blue, Tosca's eyes are black-night."
" The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it.

" The author concludes the story with he paragraph because they both go togather the away there both about things going and leaving the season changing. like they don’t won’t to let go but they knew there be back soon. Thats why the author combided the story with the paragraph..What shall I do if they all go wrong?.Soon it's never more   When you've got to pay for   Promises, made in the night      Call the magic one   And with the magic comes   Forever chained to the flame      It's too late   Too late for tears   Too late   And no one hears you   Do you feel a touch of evil   (Then) It's too late      To wish and make it so   To feel the power growing   Stronger, blessed by the dark      And when the candle fades   You can say it was a   Joke you played   So you must let me go, no      It's too late   You've said the word   Too late   Something heard you   Too late, now the race is on   And you're run out of road   Too late   For tears   Too late   And no one hears you   Can you feel the touch of evil   It's too late      Oh oh oh save me   I believe in your name   Oh oh I've fallen down   But now I've found   Nobody to take the blame      Misery   It's come to drag me away   And when the hunter cries   No alibis   Get ready for judgment day      As the candle fades   You can say it was a game you made   So you must let me go, let me go      It's too late, you've said the word   Too late, something heard you   Too late, the spell is gone   And this time you're the fool      It's too late for tears   Too late   And no one hears you   Welcome to forever   Welcome it's too late   Too late.If words that were spoken, had not shattered me   If I was unbroken, I'd never know   The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go   To be unbroken, what would that be?.Once upon a time there was a funny girl   Who fell for a funny boy   They built a funny house and made some funny kids   And christened it the house of holy joy      If forever meant forever that was the place   Or so she told her friends   But the city took her lovers to another world   Left her waiting for the flowers to bloom again      And she laughed   And she cried   She damn near died   On the day it rained forever      She walked around the garden with an empty mind   Feeling tired and worn   Not exactly sure what she was meant to find   Heaven knows maybe a rose without a thorn      She laughed   She cried   She damn near died   On the day it rained forever.Now I'm here can you see me   'cause I'm out on my own   When the room goes cold tell me   You can feel me   Cause I'm here      Here I am, can you see me   Passing through, on my way   To a place I'd been to only in my   Dreams before      In a world of delusion   Never turn your back on a friend   'cause you can count your   Real true friends on one hand      Through life      There are those that deceive you   There are those that'll let you down   Is there someone out there that would   Die for you   Thought not      Live your life with a passion   Everything you do, do well   You only get out of life what you put in   So they say      In a world of confusion   People never say what they mean   If you want a straight answer   Go look for one   Right now      In a room full of strangers   Do you stand with your back to the wall   Do you sometimes feel like you're   On the outside   Looking in?"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, saeng was talking about how she failed the test, in which she wanted to retake. So, saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she shall take the test again..You're the dawn in my dark eyes!.Full of sorrow life!.I gave up the fight for love, whoa oh oh   Walked away to calm for gloves   No more wishing on a star   Waiting for someone, whoa   What if no one ever comes      So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself   Oh, I never felt nothing better   Baby how could I know you'd come crashing down from Heaven   Now my heart is open forever      I don't have to sleep to dream   I can hardly believe what I see   When you stand before me   You're everything I never thought   That I would ever find   Now I don't have to sleep to dream   You're a dream to me      There's a cure for bleeding hearts, whoa   Think you showed me where to start   Every time I lose my grip   You keep me hangin' on, whoa oh oh   You remind that I'm strong      So I kept my eyes closed, hands up, dancing by myself   Oh, I never felt nothing better   Baby how could I know you'd come crashing down from Heaven   Now my heart is open forever      I don't have to sleep to dream   I can hardly believe what I see   When you stand before me   You're everything I never thought   That I would ever find   Now I don't have to sleep to dream   You're a dream      I don't have to sleep to dream   I can hardly believe what I see   When you stand before me   You're everything I never thought   That I would ever find   Now I don't have to sleep to dream   You're a dream to me      You're a dream      I don't have to sleep to dream   I can hardly believe what I see   When you stand before me   You're everything I never thought   That I would ever find   Now I don't have to sleep to dream   You're a dream, dream   You're a dream to me.He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he,   he spoke right out..Past midnight,   Breathing in the dark."
"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.     .That's it..He is turning, turning to face us..By Tom Paxton   Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight   And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight   What the dollar used to get us now won't buy a head of lettuce   No the economic forecast isn't right   But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray   I can even glimpse a new and better way   And I've devised a plan of action worked it down to the last fraction   And I'm going into action here today   CHORUS:   I am changing my name to Chrysler   I am going down to Washington D.C..Don't be sad, I know you well..Boom!"
"The author concludes the story with “when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end..[Chorus:]      Supercalifragilisticespianadocious, that's some supaer fruity cali cush he super smokin doce, doce and the gabana frames I'm gucci half the time think that it's my clothing line, do it like la kitchen show me yours I'll show you mine, I'm high up out my mind don't think I'm lyin cause I ain't lyin, if smokin is a crime then that's a cryin shame, mary jane mary jane I love the mary jane it's underrated underappreciated highly decorated damn I been hella patient but I'm losing all my patience many wanna duplicate, generate, penatrate innovative bachelor, gucci mane the bachelor..Wasn't I always   A friend to you?.Take your payroll   And your lottery   There's a place I know   There's a robbery      And I swear I'll never tell   If you swear you'll never tell   And we'll all make out so well   We will all make out so well      Head on with my hate   Into the lights ahead   I'm amazed that I'm still standing   And I demand that we all blend in   I'm amounted      Just the same old   Glitter story   From the sea floor   Metamorphosis   And I can't change back for you   I will not change back for you   I must live in skin that's new   I'm a livid skin that's new      Head on with my hate   Into the lights ahead   I'm amazed that I'm still standing   And I demand that we all blend in   I'm amounted      Turn your insides out to the outside   Turn the outside in to the inside   Trade your outside in for the inside   Turn it around again   Turn your insides out to the outside   Turn the outside in to the inside   Trade your outside in for the inside   Turn it around again      I'm amounted      And I can't change back for you   No I can't change back for you.Here and now I willingly place a part of you upon my hand..Some goes to women, some goes to Jesus,   Though I'm absolutely certain both's all right."
"To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing “now.” The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test..I'd rather believe in love..I said it's gonna disappear when you turn your back..Two lanes of freedom..Lately love keeps keeping up at night   Tossing and turning, my love   Wanna kiss you, wanna hold you real tight   Ooo but I wonder love whether you know or not   You just hurry away, leaving me laying there in shock      I just wanna be the one that you wanna see   I just wanna have you near me   But you fly away almost everyday   You work a lot but you never stop to love      Stop, I love you so stop   Come home from the road   Gotta stop to love   And let's celebrate, celebrate the love we got, stop   Say you're coming home      You say my love has always been on your mind   But how can I ever love you, when you keep working overtime?.Goodnight Dear Jesus,   Goodnight, goodnight ."
"The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She relizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explaned in the last paragh that once the hibiscus buds she will take the test again..yeah a real H time boy straight from HELENA man..Tired of playing this game   And I won't play it no more   And I won't take it no more   Through with being your fool   And I won't do it no more   And I won't, I won't keep up this act   Not for one minute   I'm gonna pull, I'm gonna pull this curtain down      [Chorus]   This time I won't play this game   I made a vow to make a change   And I bow out   I won't be hanging around, baby   I decline to take the pain   And I resign the masquerade   And I bow out   I won't be staying around, baby   I bow out      Can't go on with the show   You're just a stage I went through   Now you're just fading from view, yeah baby   It's time for a change of scene   Guess I'll be taking my leave   I guess I won't, I won't stay in this play   Not for one minute   I'm gonna make, I'm gonna make my exit now   Oh baby      [Chorus]      When you're left standing on that stage all alone   Maybe you will realize   You should of learned to treat me right   And when this final act is finally through   Maybe you'll wish you'd been   The kind of man you should have been   Now watch me say goodbye   And walk right out of your life   Oh baby, all right babe      [Chorus: x2].Tonight is our last night together,   Nearest and dearest must part,   The love that has bound us together   Is shredded and torn apart..(Gavroche climbs the barricade)      Lesgles   Come back Gavroche, don't you dare!.Stop, ya bet your life you'll linger there a little while      We've got heaven right here on earth   With those beautiful queens   Way down yonder in New Orleans      You're gonna find heaven right here on earth   With all them beautiful queens   Way down yonder in New Orleans   I'm goin' down yonder to New Orleans   It's way down yonder in New Orleans"
"I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, ”When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. .Gold chain, white mesh,   Fame is the name of the game, yes yes!.Yerushalaym   Yerushalem   Oh, oh, oh....Hanging with the mayor and all his friends   And nobody cares,   Where the sailor shuts out the sunrise   Blacked out on the stairs      [Chorus]   Knock twice, rap with your cane   Feels nice, you're out of the rain   We got your skinny girl   Here at the Western World      Ruthie will give you the silver key   To open the red door:   Lay down your Jackson and you will see   The sweetness you've been crying for      In the night you hide from the madman   You're longing to be   But it all comes out on the inside   Eventually      [Chorus]      In the night you hide from the madman   You're longing to be   But it all comes out on the inside   Eventually      [Chorus].I heard the thunder over canaan..What do you think your fists are for?"
"The authoR concludes the stoRy with this paRagRaph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do thing in the spring when she sees flowers gRowing because she feels like she is at home, so she feel moRe confident. about passing the test..I still believe in you and me   Still believe the sun will shine on me      I still believe there's a reason, there's a meaning to why we're here   There is a place where we can go to where we don't have to live in fear   They're trying to tell me that the moon is in the ocean..Drift into a deeper state   I stalk the cobwebbed stairways   Dirt grits between my feet   The stair creaks, I precariously sneak   Hypnosis guides my hand   I slipside through the walkways   Sit in granny's rockin' chair   Memories are whirling by, yeah   Reminisce in the attic   Lucretia waits impatiently   Cobwebs make me squint   The cobra so eloquently glints   Moonbeams surge through the sky   The crystal ball's energized   Surely that like the cat waiting   Lucretia rocks away.Back in the days I made up my mind   That I would be a king, you know, genuine   Reign supreme at the top of the heap   And like working all day, no time to sleep   Destined to rise, in front of your eyes   So we surmise, it's time for the prize   The time has come, we gotta be number one   The world is full of power and we got to get some   No more beggin' and useless teardrops   So I'm trading these teardrops for props   Goin' all the way and with my powerful team   Conquering the world and I'ma rise like cream   All out, putting heads to bed   'Cause I'm a grown man and I hate to get spoon-fed   Wisdom, son, I rose in the east   Till we reach the top, won't be no peace, 'cause it's      [Chorus:]   Strictly business, strictly business   Ain't no way I'm gonna stop   Strictly business, ain't no time to get more   Gotta make it to the top      Everything we do, gotta be brand new   The moves we make, gotta make the earth shake   Sitting at my desk, 'cause I manifest to my team   Big plans that'll make us the best   'Cause we can rule this game we all play   Pop champagne and make everyday a holiday   Smooth as a rose but hard like steel   From now on, I'ma make my dreams real   On a mission, gotta get there   If you want to rule, you gotta be in there   Our masterplan is the best   And ain't a man alive that'll beat us to a conquest   'Cause this is the reason we was born   To rock on and on and on and on   Look at my eyes, it's hypnotizing   Word is bond, we gotta keep on rising      [Chorus:]      I'ma be a legend in all the books and mags   Stuffin' the cash inside garbage bags   Ain't no time to waste, we gotta motivate   Pass anybody that stops to get gas   Forever and a day, my destiny's set   No sweat, I make it rougher than rougher gets   Hold on tight, if not, get blown away   Pick up the pieces 'cause we're known to say   Radical things to get a champion's ring   Give it up, punk, don't make me swing   We planned ahead to get the butter and the bread   Dressed in black and I'm stayin' out the red   So when it comes to like taking charge   Get props for where they do and stop frontin' on tar   Gotta go for what you know to be the cream of the crop   With the power of God, I'ma rise to the top, it's      [Chorus:]      Uncle L (uhh!).That leaves me a mixed-up with the red, white and blue..Nothing but a two-beach comber!"
" The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she is has perserverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly. And thAt she needs to appreciate it.I love the sound of smashing guitars   I love the sound of crashing guitars   Red guitars against the wall   Big guitars can turn so small   I love the sound of crashing guitars   Show it!.Hey!.Just like me (Just like me)   They long to be   Close to you..All I ever wanted   Just to be with you   Just to be with you      All I ever wanted   Want to be with you   Got to be with you      All I ever wanted   Was to be with you   Just to be with you      All I ever wanted   Just to be with you   To be free with you   Yeah be with you      All I ever wanted   Come on be with you   Be with you   All that I want to do   Hey be with you      All I ever wanted   Come on be with you   Everything that I do   Yes I do it for you   Yeah be with you      All I ever wanted   Come on be with you.But we said one ""hello."""
" It shows in this time of doubt that she will overcome. In the story the plant showed hope and in showing this gave her hope. All the memories that she recalled had made her sad at first but in the end gave her hope..Lament for my cock   Sore and crucified   I seek to know you   Acquiring soulful wisdom   You can open walls of mystery   Strip show      How to acquire death in the morning show   TV death which the child absorbs   Death well mystery which makes me write   Slow train, the death of my cock gives life      Forgive the poor old people who gave us entry   Taught us god in the child's praye in the night      Guitar player   Ancient wise satyr   Sing your ode to my cock      Caress it's lament   Stiffen and guide us, we frozen   Lost cells   The knowledge of cancer   To speak to the heart   And give the great gift   Words Power Trance      This stable friend and the beast of his zoo   Wild haired chicks   Women flowering in their summit   Monsters of skin   Each color connects   To create the boat   Which rocks the race   Could any hell be more horrible   Than now   And real?.Devil's highway he's right beside me   Whispering in my ear   He drew the map and set the trap   But I'm the one that got me here   Made a mess of my whole life   Burned every bridge I crossed   Am I too far gone which way is home   How did I get so lost      [Chorus:]   I'm looking for a good place to turn around   And get off this road that I'm headed down   I've gotta find some peace of mind   Lord, send a sign somehow   I just need a good place to turn around      If You can hear me, I'm on empty   Forgive me of my past   For being hateful to every angel   You put into my path   For mama's tears and wasted years   And getting so off track   I'll do anything, is there any way   That You can take me back      In the dead of night I see a light   Shining up ahead   There's a parking lot, I had to stop   'Cause the little church sign says      [Chorus:]   Are you looking for a good place to turn around   And get off that road that you're headed down   You can find some peace of mind   What better time than now   Are you looking for a good place to turn around   This feels like a good place to turn around.I don't care if your love grows cold   Found love in someone else's home   Don't like standin' in the snow      Everything's turning to gold   Everything's turning to gold   Everything's turning to gold      You used to know me long ago   Was so lost and way down low..A dirty old claw caught at her breast   Blood on the kitchen floor   A tightrope yawning at her undress   Her skyline all rip and torn   She prepared for an occupation   She climbed she cut away   The crows to steal on her battlefield   Sharpen her bloodied nail   So where are your angels?.And I'm so sick of sickness yeah   Why do I write the songs so dickless yeah."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph...It's the season of the golden leaves   When the wind turns into a bitter breeze      I was walking through the oak leaves on the hill   With my lady, oh she's got a strong will   And I see her through these ever-clouded eyes   This time it's goodbye and I can't answer why      Maybe it's because I ain't quite shy of running yet   Or maybe it's because I'm the hometown boy in the spotlight   But my roots ain't in the ground   They're on the road      Settle down was all I ever heard from her   ""If you cared,"" she said, ""you would weigh my words""   But my life doesn't ride on the factory road   Baby, don't ask me why, I can't even pretend to know.I can't say the words I mean   Make myself go through the line..Another sleepless night,   I sit alone and cry,   Twilight time 'til dawn,   Memories linger on,   Since we said goodbye..And lock your doors and stay inside."
" The author includes that because it show that she is not given up. Since she is not given up she can have more trys..Holding you again   Even for the briefest moment   Made me realize how much I love you still   Wanting you to want me   Still not knowing if you ever will..Is a place for heroes,   That never compromise..Grew so high, hid the sky,   Shaded everything I needed to see   Then one night, someone came      Took a knife an ripped me up by my roots   Tossed astray, far away..Are you complete?.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa      Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love)   There is one question I'd really love to ask (One heart)   Is there a place for the hopeless sinner   Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?"
" I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see’s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack..Is there anybody in there?.I got my mind made up and I can't let go..If you are my shepherd   Then I'm lost and no one can find me..When cockleshells turn silver bells   Then will my love return to me   Then will my love return to me   Then will my love return to me   Love return to me   Love return to me   Love return   Love return   Love return to me..Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd."
"The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn’t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng’s determination to pass the test and do better next time..If you think he'll love you better   Your every wish is his command   Baby he's your man      Baby he's your man..Right up until the very end   It's gonna be me and my friend,   It's gonna be me and my friend.But, you're better off with a love that's long..Back to back and side to side   There's only music on my mind   Nothing to worry about but the beat   I wanted you to come and dance with me   But you wanted to stay home and watch TV   Ahhh, but when I got there to my surprise   There was another guy looking in your eyes      I don't want, don't want us to fuss and fight   From right now 'til tomorrow night   So if you promise to love only me and be by my side   I'll let you slide      Without a doubt tonight is the night   That we gon' really roll when the time is right   And we're gonna carry it into the dawn   Oh, but where are you, where can you be?.(We want information, information, information)   (Who are you?)"
" I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom.Neighbor, neighbor, why you messin' in my life?.When this is all over   You'll be in clover   We'll go on out and spend   All of your blue money      Blue money   Blue money   Blue money   Juice money   Loose money   Blue money, honey   Blue money....Is that really the way that you look now?.It's a heck of a day to be us!.There's pigeons down on Market Square."
"The author concludes the story with thise paragraph so that we buy his comming book, or so that we get more exited..Between yesterday and tomorrow   There is more there is more than a day..It's gonna start....Ain't superstitious,   But black cat crossed my trail,   (I said it so many times before)   Ain't superstitious,   A black cat crossed my trail..[Chorus]   When God comes and gathers his jewels   All his treasures of diamonds and gold   You'll meet her up there in heaven so fair   When God comes and gathers his jewels..The Holy Spirit is here and His power is real   Anything can happen and it probably will   Something very good something good is going on around here      There's a light that shines to make the dark disappear   A power at work but there's nothing to fear   Something very good something good is going on around here      This is a church on fire   This is the Holy Spirit flame   We have a burning desire   To lift up Jesus' name   Let the fire burn in every heart   To light the way, defeat the dark   Let the flame of love burn higher   This is a church   This is a church on fire"
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that’s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can’t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. “She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now”. Saeng didn’t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won’t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng’s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph..I begin, by recognizing your power and also your grace, and how your children become one when we come before your glorious face..The city's a blaze, the town's on fire....As you slept, I kept thinking of the night we met..You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that   We ever met, I can't believe you just said that   You're so cold you just hit me so low   I can't take this no more, so hit the road      I don't wanna say goodbye   But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like   All I wanna do is cry   Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight      Some things just don't seem the way they do   One day you tell me I love you and only you   I wake up to find out it was a dream   You're telling me you hate me, you're leaving me   People change everything changes   We go from best friends then become strangers   We go from seeing each other everyday then   Farewell to never seeing your face again      I can't get you outta of my head   So I'm out of bed at 4 in the morning   Wishing I was dead   But for some odd reason I can't do it   For some reason I needed to write   What's on my mind and what's going through it   Cause if I don't I'll probably suffocate   Why do you have so much hate   Towards me you need some loving babe   God I fucking love you I hate myself   For falling in love with you   Just to find out all I did was trouble you   My heart is aching I'm medicated   I tried meditating   But nothing works I don't even feel sedated   I wish you could feel what I feel for one second   I reckon you would jump out your window bare naked   Fuck humiliation, you do anything to get me back   Opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact   You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good   And do everything to have me if you could      I don't wanna say goodbye   But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like   All I wanna do is cry   Say my farewells, pack up and leave tonight"

" The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese..Night!.No driving, no sleeping   Live it up like it's the weekend   When the D.J..Lady Luck   Here I am on time   Proppin' up the bar   with a glass of wine   Friday night   and I'm all spruced up and fine   I ain't goin' nowhere      Lady Luck   Why don't you pull up a chair   And bring your shine right wisdom   Darlin' over here   Your Gaelic humor   And your pious smile   All the cats'll be laugin' tonight      Now you may say it's a funny old world   You may say that the game ain't fair   Is there a plot or do you improvise   Or maybe you don't even care      Lady Luck   Ain't you the fickle kind   Why are some folks lucky   While the rest are tryin'   You keep on playin'   It's still a mystery   You're laced with a touch   of inconsistancy      So why don't you give us all a break   Make us all rich healthy and fine   Five months holidays and a four hour week   And a horse that wins all the time      Lady Luck   Hear the mandolins   Kind of makes you wonder   How it might have been   There go all   The funny place I've got   Back on the street again      Lady Luck   Yeah, it's late I know   Allow me to buy you one more folderol   And tell me something   I've been longin' to hear   It's gotta get better next year      'Cause I've seen some rainy days   My wedding suits are frayed and torn   But now the sun comes shining through   I've cried in my beer too long      Lady Luck, Lady Luck   Don't push me over   When I can't stand up, oh yeah   Sure it's a funny old world   Sure it's a funny old world.Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me..The wind is howling and the time is right for fear   In the emergence in the phosphorescent tears   And all the hippies gonna lick the mind of God?"
" The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty..Out of the night and out of the dark   Into the fire and into the fight   Well that's the way the heroes go, Ho!.[Chorus].Help is coming   I heard a whisper   White caps turning   Breath of summer      Distant drummin'   Lire birds callin'   Escape the anguish of our past   And pray      Empires crumbling   Callous winter   Fear is running   No longer with us      We sail tomorrow   For Ellis Island   Escape, anger of our past   And pray that peace will come at last   And dream      Release the anger of our past   And pray that peace will come at last   And stay   Help is coming      Help is coming   We sail tomorrow   For Ellis Island   Help is coming      Dreams come true   We'll sail tomorrow   Dreams come true   Help is coming.Tell me where I draw the line, let me have it one more time..Gloria, can you waddle, ah, ah?"
"I think the author of “Winter Hibiscus” said “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.” to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn’t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way..Maybe it's because I'm only starting   That I think it won't take too long   Maybe it's because I can see you laughing   That I think you've got it wrong   Maybe I could be like Robin Hood   Like and outlaw dressed all in green   Someone said what's he gonna turn out like   And someone else said never mind   Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old   As all the cats I'd ever seen   I grew my hair and bought a suit   Of shiny white or was it cream   I shook and shivered danced and quivered   And stood on a mountain top      No one came from miles around and said   Man your music is really hot      Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak   My throat was tired and worn   My pretty face just looked out of place   As they poured on the scorn   I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king   He said my boy we'll have some crazy scenes   There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about   He must've been the king of queens   Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done   But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung   There's a law for the rich and one for the poor   And there's another one for sing   It's die young and live much longer   Spend your money and sit and wonder      No one came for miles around   And said man your music is really funky      I believe that I must tell the truth   And say things as they really are   But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth   Could I ever be a star   Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'   Everyone's shouting out loud   It's only the glitter and shine that gets through   Where's my Robin Hood outfit   Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye   No one ever cared enough to say goodbye   The money's good and the time you have   Fun and games galore   But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten   And you wonder what you did it for      No one came from miles around   And said man who's he?.How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable   So condescending unnecessarily critical   I have the tendency of getting very physical   So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle      You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here   The double vision I was seeing is finally clear   You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone   Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground I'm walking on      [Chorus]   When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love   You'll understand what I mean when I say   There's no way we're gonna give up   And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams   Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe   Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe      What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head   You should know better you never listened to a word I said   Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat   Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did      When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love   You'll understand what I mean when I say   There's no way we're gonna give up   And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams   Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe   Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe      Does it kill   Does it burn   Is it painful to learn   That it's me that has all the control      Does it thrill   Does it sting   When you feel what I bring   And you wish that you had me to hold      When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love   You'll understand what I mean when I say   There's no way we're gonna give up   And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams   Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe   Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe   Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe.Then they caught you with the girl next door,   People's money piled on the floor,   Accusations that you try to deny,   Revelations and rumours begin to fly..Do you know how a lost heart fears   At the thought of reminiscing,   And how lips that taste of tears   Lose their taste for kissing?.Your price, name the time   The suspect or the crime   The shadow of my gun   Get down or you can run      Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire   Empty room, turn the key   You're never alone   When you're with me      Temptation, break the vow   Cut flesh from the sacred cow   Unchain the tiger, kiss the flame, feel your desire   Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire      Soaked in fear, the curtain falls   Religion within these walls   Mystify my soul beliefs   Confession is my release      Feed the demon, kiss the flame, feel your desire   Unchain the tiger, crucify, feed your desire   Pearl of euphoria   Pearl of euphoria"
" The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence..I meant when it counted all to play   I don't care   But I can see   That underneath   Your building right in front of me, I   Might - take - you - home   But if I could, well I'll know you're not afraid   Of what you hear in the tone   If you heard of the church not following,   That I'll never take you home   Noooo!.In dream you can love forever   And there's no return..I'm so so so so tired..Once you told me you were gonna love me   That it was meant to be and there's no other way   Then came someone showed you more fun   We've had a good run better think it over      Do the right thing baby do the right thing   Go with your heart and do the right thing      He's got a good line, shows you a good time   Did he change your mind guess it's your move   I'll lose my pride I'd even step aside   Honey you really must decide who's best for you      Do the right thing baby do the right thing   Go with your heart and do the right thing   Do the right thing baby do the right thing   Go with your heart and do the right thing      You might chose me or chose to lose me   Someday you'll see the good thing you had      Do the right thing baby do the right thing   Go with your heart and do the right thing   Do the right thing baby do the right thing   Go with your heart and do the right thing   Go with your heart and do the right thing.Somebody give me a grade!"
"The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn’t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that’s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things..[click]   [Bang!].Hurry, hurry, Hurricane..Where is Mathew, now it's getting dark?.Know the end is coming, heed this sign   By the morning star the four horsemen ride..I know, I see."
" The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph..Lead us up the mountain   Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God   Lead us up the mountain   Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God   Lead us up the mountain   Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God   Lead us up the mountain   Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God   Lead us up the mountain   Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God   Lead us up the mountain   Lead us to the place Your glory dwells God.wannabes that try to hang with me   But g don't play for free, he plays for the sensi   And to the critics... eat me   Slam your body down and wind it all around   Slam your body down and wind it all around   Chorus   Yo, I'll tell ya what I want, what I really really want   So tell me what ya want, whatcha really really want   I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, really really want is to get, get down   Slam your body down and wind it all around   S to the l to the a to the m   Slam your body down with the zebrahead, yeah!.Take my heart my soul my seed..Or you'll end up where you came from like the rest of us   Diggin', diggin', diggin.I am star child, big smile,   Living in LA, I'm coming over,   Baby you can't go to school today,   Dum dum,   Go to school today."
" It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that’s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story.Is that what I want?.Never Been Funked   I ain't trying to make no political statement   I ain't trying to tell you the news of the world   I ain't one to give intellectual realness   I just want you to want me the way that I do      Don't it make you feel good, make you feel good?.Where the young men's brave new visions threaten old men's selfish   Dreams   And they try to crush the spirit with their money and machines   And they call it communism because they don't know what it means   In the third world war      And the rich keep getting richer and as wrong as they are right   And the poor become the victims of the armies of the night   And the odds are never even and their skins are never white   In the third world war      Broken rules and dirty warriors spreading lies and secret funds   Can't defeat the campesino with their money and their guns   'cause he's fighting for his future and his freedom and his sons   In the third world war...You left me with your touch   So thank you very much!"
"I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she’ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph..You're far away from me   Our room is not the same   By chance I heard the radio today   Mention your name      The world's an open window   The wold is big and you're so small   What awaits you, what do you see   When you're far away from me?.But, keep an eye out for the next complication..[Chorus]   We are the fortunate ones,   Who've never faced oppression's gun..Hey, everybody, gather 'round   Listen to that bongo sound   Grab the first one in your reach   Now we're going to shake the beach      Do the clam, do the clam   Grab your barefoot baby by the hand   Turn and tease, hug and squeeze   Dig right in and do the clam      You can get your heart to spin   On the outside looking in   Moon ain't gonna last all night   Well, let's work up an appetite      Do the clam, do the clam   Grab your barefoot baby by the hand   Turn and tease, hug and squeeze   Dig right in and do the clam      Everybody's got that beat   Well, listen to those happy feet   Ain't you glad that you found out   What the clam is all about?.Seven weeks have passed now since she left me   And she shows her face to ask me how I am."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time..The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad..It's alright I'll come 'round when you're not in   And I'll pick up all my things   Everything I have bought with you   But that's alright too   It's just everything I do   We did together   And there's a little piece of you   In whatever   I've got everything I need   I've got petrol in the car   I've got some money with me   There's just one problem      You're the only one I want [Repeat: x4]      It's alright I know where I'm going   I'm going to stay with my friend   Yes, he's very good looking   The only trouble is   He's not you   He can't do what you do   He can't make me laugh and cry   At the same time   Let's change things   Let's danger it up   We're crazy enough   I just can't take it      You're the only one I want [Repeat: x4]      I know where I'm going   But I don't want to leave   I just have one problem   We're best friends, yeah?.How much is enough?.Early in the morning and I can't get right   Had a little date with my baby last night      Now it's early in the morning   Ooh, in the morning   Early in the morning   And I ain't got nothing but the blues      I went to all the places where we used to go   I went to our house but she don't live there no more      Now it's early in the morning   Ooh, in the morning   Early in the morning   And I ain't got nothing but the blues      I went to your girlfriend's house but she was out   I knocked on her mother's door and she began to shout   ""Get away, mad boy""      Yes, early in the morning   Ooh, in the morning   Early in the morning   And I ain't got nothing but the blues      I went to [Incomprehensible] to get something to eat   The waitress looked at me and said   ""Pops, you sure look beat""      Now it's early in the morning   Ooh, in the morning   Early in the morning   And I ain't got nothing but the blues      I had a lot of money when I started out   Couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out      Now it's early in the morning   Ooh, in the morning   Early in the morning   And I ain't got nothing but the blues      In the morning   Yeah, so early in the morning   Come back to me, baby   In the morning   Early in the morning   Come back to me, baby.Today was just a blur you gotta head like a ghost train   What was that sound ringing around your brain?"
" She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it..Nobody came..Don't speak on it, shut ya trap   I see ya whole crew yellow like mustard packs   Ah woo, Doc in my own zone   You say you got the rap games sewn   But it's sewn wrong   I ride through ya hood in a Mr. Softee truck   Then pull a mac out a box of snow cones   Yeah, ya little fucks   Gimme ya fuckin' money   [Incomprehensible]   Uhuh, check it   I'm hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on   Playing with a dynamite stick, where did I go wrong?.No more trouble,   In this town..Can I dance?.It falls for you."
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that’s how the girl feel. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did..I can't wait to H. A. T. E. You   'Cause right now I need you   Can't wait to make you go (go) (repeat to end).Will you let me be myself   Or is your love in vain?.I'm still waiting....You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway   Half the world away, half the world away      I've been lost I've been found but I don't feel down      And when I leave this planet   You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and   I can feel the warning signs running around my mind   And if I could leave this spirit   I'll find me a hole and I will live in it and   I can feel the warning signs running around my mind      Here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole   My body feels young but my mind is very old   So what do you say ?.I don't believe you know me,   Although you know my name,   I don't believe the thoughts I have   Are only mine to blame      I don't believe the magic,   Is only in the mind,   I don't believe I'd love somebody just to pass the time      But I believe in you,   I believe in you..."
"The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver’s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle..It's coming with you....Shake it like a ladder to the sun   Makes me feel like a madman on the run   Find me never never far gone   So get your leather, leather   Leather on on on on      [Chorus]   Your zero   What's your name?.reality is what you want to see it shouldn't make a difference to me i put my trust in what you had to say it didn't make a difference anyway i know you've tried your ""very best"" and i'm so glad thank you so much disappointment is what you've made this expectations overrated disappointment is what you've made this my ambition is so deflated reality is different for me my eyes are opened wide enough to see i've listened to your explinations why the more you fail, the harder that i try a case of mistaken opportunity i guess i really got it wrong identity is insignificant or is it everything?.The dust that Pancho bit down south   Ended up in Lefty's mouth   The day they laid poor Pancho low,   Lefty split for Ohio   Where he got the bread to go,   There ain't nobody knows      The poets tell how Pancho fell,   And Lefty's living in cheap hotels   The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold,   And so the story ends we're told   Pancho needs your prayers it's true,   But save a few for Lefty too   He only did what he had to do,   And now he's growing old.I was living in a fantasy,   Waiting for somebody to rescue me,   But I've found a way to light the dark."
"The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it..All aboard!.Here I sit alone and broken hearted walk the floor all night since we parted   I'll get over you I don't know how or when it'll take awhile hold by can't last till then   Yes it'll take awhile to shake the pain of losing you   Someone will take your place but I don't know who   The world outside holds nothing now for me it'll take awhile to shake your memory   [ guitar ]   So I'll do my best to forget you as I think about the things we used to do   And I'll forget you I don't know how or when it'll take awhile if I'll hold out till then   Yes it'll take awhile....Jaded..Chorus:   Take me   Touch me   Won't you hold me close?.I said, oh, Susannah, now, don't you cry for me,   As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee."
"The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That’s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that..I buy what I'm told:   From the latest hit,   To the wisdom of old..Oh, baby now let's get down tonight   Ooh baby, I'm hot just like an oven   I need some lovin'   And baby, I can't hold it much longer   It's getting stronger and stronger   And when I get that feeling   I want sexual healing   Sexual healing, oh baby   Makes me feel so fine   Helps to relieve my mind   Sexual healing baby, is good for me   Sexual healing is something that's good for me   Whenever blue teardrops are fallin'   And my emotional stability is leaving me   There is something I can do   I can get on the telephone and call you up baby   And honey I know you'll be there to relieve me   The love you give to me will free me   If you don't know the thing you're dealing   Ohh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing   Get up, get up, get up, get up   Let's make love tonight   Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up   'cause you do it right   Baby, I got sick this mornin'   A sea was stormin' inside of me   Baby, I think I'm capsizin'   The waves are risin' and risin'   And when I get that feeling   I want sexual healing   Sexual healing is good for me   Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush   Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us   Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me   Sexual healing is something that's good for me   Well, it's good for me and it's so good to me my baby, ohh   Come take control, just grab a hold   Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey   I'll be feeling fine, the way you heal me   The way you thrill me, keep me comin' to you   For you to sexually fulfill me   You're my medicine, open up and let me in   Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate   I can't wait for you to operate, baby   I can't wait for you to operate   And baby, when I should be asleep at night   I stay up and read   And baby, baby, baby, I can't help but feel uptight   For my passion needs   And when I get this feeling   I want sexual healing   When I get this feeling   I want sexual healing   Baby, I can't stand it much longer   It's getting stronger and stronger   And when I get this feeling   I need sexual healing   Ohh, when I get this feeling   I need sexual healing   I gotta have sexual healing, darling   'cause I'm all alone   And I need sexual healing, darling   Till you come back home   Please don't procrastinate   It's not good to masturbate.I believe, yes I believe in freedom,   So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now..Tonight down here in the valley   I'm lonesome and O how I feel   As I sit here alone in my cabin   I can see your mansion on the hill      Do you recall when we parted   The story to me you revealed   You said you could live without loving   In your loveless mansion on the hill      I've waited all through the years love   To give you a heart true and real   Cause I know you're living in sorrow   In your loveless mansion on the hill      The light shine bright from yer window   The trees stand so silent and still   I know you're alone with your pride dear   In your loveless mansion on the hill.(Shut that door)      (Cross the floor) ha-ha      Hey, girl!"
"The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she’ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant..Rocking around the Christmas tree   At the Christmas party hop   Mistletoe hung where you can see   Every couple tries to stop   Rocking around the Christmas tree   Let the Christmas spirit ring   Later we'll have some pumpkin pie   And we'll do some caroling      You will get a sentimental   Feeling when you hear   Voices singing let's be jolly   Deck the halls with boughs of holly   Rocking around the Christmas tree   Have a happy holiday   Everyone dancing merrily   In the new old-fashioned way.Get out of my life, woman   You don't love me no more   Get out of my life, woman   You don't love me no more   Get out of my life, woman   You don't love me no more      Get out of my eyes teardrops   I gotta see my way around   Get out of my eyes teardrops   I gotta see my way around   Get out of my life heartache   I got heartaches by the pound   (These days)      Walk on, walk on   Walk on, walk on   Yeah, walk on      Get off my ladder, woman   I gotta climb up to the top   Get off my ladder, woman   I gotta climb up to the top   Get off my ladder, woman   You know that I can't stop      I can't stop   I can't stop   I can't stop   I can't stop      Get out of my life, woman   I gotta be moving on   Get out of my life, woman   I gotta be moving on   Get out of my life, woman   It's so long      Bye, bye, bye, bye   So long   Bye, bye, bye, bye   So long   Little darlin' goodbye   So long, so long      Twenty long years   Little darlin'   That I spent with you   Twenty long years   That we shared a home   Twenty long years   Little darlin'   Now   I'm black and blue   Twenty long years   Now   I'm back on my own      Bye, bye   So long   Bye, bye   So long.Break the chains of your life and start feeling good   What's so bad about feeling good?.Hands over my head thinking 'what else could go wrong? '.I hate puppy dogs and kittens,   I hate flowers in the Spring!"
" When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn’t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don’t want people to think that she just worries about the plants..I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains..Pull up the roost, pull up the roots   Colored lights and shiny curtains....Open the curtain   Break down the walls between my head and my heart      Happiness, it's written in the books   Happiness, your fortune and your looks   Happiness, you tie it on your wrist   Happiness, there must be more than this      Everyone's drunk and happy   Swaying deep in a trance   Feet are stomping, hands are clapping   Saying life is a dance      Everything's burning, dancing and turning   Wine like a rive flowing rapid and red   Can I be certain?.A bird, I do too   (A pearl is made by an oyster), New Orleans?.I just can't get you out of my head,   Boy it's more than I dare to think about,   I-i-i-i just can't get you out of my head,   Boy it's more than I dare to think about."
" The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story..Should I follow my head, or my heart?.Now that you're back where you belong?.Does anybody see what's going on   Do I have to wear my scars like a badge on my arm   For you to see me   I need relief      Do I have to scream for you to hear me   Do I have to bleed for you to see me   Cause I grieve   Your not listening to me   Do I need to scream      Has anybody seen what's been done   Where were my defense   No one heard my protest   The eyes of God were watching me   It's time to make my peace,   Let is go and be released   So I can breathe again (breathe again)   I'm on my knees      Do I have to scream for you to hear me   Do I have to bleed for you to see me   Cause I grieve   Your not listening to me   Do I need to scream (Repeat)      I don't have to scream for you to hear me   I don't have to bleed for you to see me   Cause I'm clean   And your listening to me   I don't have to scream.Inseperable, That's how we'll always be   Inseperable, Just you and me   It's so wonderful to know you'll always be around   Incredible, What you are to me   Incredible, You bring out the woman in me   With your style of love   Inseperable, Yes we are   Well like a flower to a tree   Like words to a melody of love   There's no way we could break up   No words that can make us   Blow our thing..How long can this lonely night be, I sing the same old sad love song,   It's the only song I know, it's just like me,   And I believe someone took your love away, I want to bring love back today,   But if somehow I don't get to you, you'll still be okay."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years..I went to his side and sat on the ground   And laid his old head on my knee   Well, he was the best friend that I ever had   I cried so I scarcely could see      Old Sheppie he knew, he was going to go   For he reached out and licked at my hand   He looked up at me, just as much as to say   We're parting but you understand      Now old Sheppie is gone where the good doggies go   And no more with old Shep will I roam   But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing for sure   Old Shep has a wonderful home.My mama   She done told me   Soon you be a man   And when you find your own woman   You got to love her the best that you can      Well, if you give your love to somebody   Make sure they don't use you up   And if you get your love in return   Make sure you fill the lovin' cup      Oh, yeah   Uh-huh   La-de-ay      Well, I'm goin' to the country   Mama, don't you want to go   The sun's gonna shine in our back door   I know      Mama   She done told me   Lord, you gonna be a man   And when you find your own woman   Gotta hold to her the best that you can      I'm goin' to the country   Baby don't you want to go   The sun's gonna shine in our back door   And I know      To fill the lovin' cup   Fill the lovin' cup   Fill the lovin' cup   Oh, yeah yeah yeah.That I want   If you had   If you knew me      (There is nothing in your eyes)   There is nothing in your eyes   (But that's the way you cry)   But that's the way you cry, girl (cry, girl)   (All is grand, all is bright)   All is grand, all is bright   (You're just steady in my mind)      I walk around I'm sufferin'   In my doom   When I come to you,   You're sittin' in your room   You sit around in the strangest place   So take off the mask   So I can see your face   Who do you love?.So many times   I've asked myself the question   Hiding in plain sight   Is your love another self-propeller perception      Burning in my mind   You don't know where I've been   I count too many sins   To play de sad charade      Suspicion kisses you when I do   Though I've never let you know   I only wish you knew what I knew   So we could both enjoy the show      Here in the crucible   Or could there be another explanation   I'm not aware of   Or should I just ignore the situation      Call me in care of   I don't know where you've been   Your lie's is paper thin   I see the truth erased      Suspicion kisses you when I do   Though I've never let you know   I only wish you knew what I knew   So we could both enjoy the show      Here in the crucible   You don't know where I've been   I count too many sins   To play de sad charade      Suspicion kisses you when I do   Though I've never let you know   I only wish you knew what I knew   So we could both enjoy the show   Here in the crucible.He gonna pull through this one again make a few records about it and it's gonna be over ya know what I'm saying?"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1..Is it my imagination or is it my iron pride   I wonder if it matters much if time is on my side   I'd rather press on, I don't wanta rest easy   Anywhere I stray, I will make it a brand new day   Anyway, that is all I've gotta say   I'd rather be by the seaside   Than be playing a one night stand   I've been too wrapped up in my own dreams   I will change things if I can   I gotta press on, don't wanta rest easy   Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine   And all of the sunshine that we knew   You will never know what blue is   Until you have played the game   Till you live life in solitaire where   No one knows your name   I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy   Have it anyway you will   I will be with you right up until   The spell is broken and all is well   If you'd rather be by the seashore   Well, I sure can understand   Are you too wrapped up in your own scene   I would change things if I can   I'd rather press on, don't want to rest easy   Wouldn't it feel fine   But remembering the rhythm and the rhymes   And all of the good times makes me blue   Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine   And all of the sunshine that we knew.Come, the New Jerusalem..I want to be your chauffeur, I want to ride your little machine   I want to be your chauffeur, I want to ride your little machine   I want to put a tiger, baby I want to put a tiger, baby..P.P.D.S.P.E.M.R.M.F.O.B.T..Headless Boogie   [Violent J]   It's Friday night, dark, scary   Lonely, walking through the park, cemetery   And its foggy, cold and smoggy   Hear a dog, a howling doggy   I'm scared, should of brung the shotgun   Should of, would of, but I ain't got one   So I watch my back, and what's that   The caretaker, a dirty old hunchback   Better run, hide, quick, fast   He's coming for my ass with a shovel   No where to run, nore to hide but the grave bit   So I dove in, I did the dumb shit   Took a fall, deeper than six foot   Down the stairs, hit a floor and through a door   Into a whole new world of stiffs   Bodies, heads, and sexy little dead chicks   Club lights, sounds, bass   DJs spinnin with maggots on they face   And what I saw next then really took me   Uh, they did the headless boogie   [Chorus (2x)]   Hey yo, I heard that you died   Fuck that, it's time to get live   Dead bodies let's all take a ride   Lean to the left and slide (the headless boogie)   ""Oh yeah, we dug up the finest   Bitches in the graveyard   So come on down   And if you ain't come to get your funk out   Then get the fuck out, bitch""   [Violent J]   They all stand straight and swing to the side   No heads, but they feet still glide   Take a step back, twist and dive   I even seen Kurt Cobain get live (blam!)"
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home..Misguided, another day has come and gone without the truth..I don't thing so   Is this love?.I walked in the crib   Got two kids   And my baby mamma late   Uh oh uh oh uh oh   And so I had to did what I had to did   Cuz I had the kid   Duh oh duh oh duh oh   Up all night, gettin' my money right   Until the blue and white's   Po po po po po po   Now the money comin' slow   But at least a nigga know slow motion better then   No No No      Hey yo I, I know I could make it right   If I could just swallow my pride   But I can't run away   You put my gun away   You can't front on me   I, no I can't let it ride   No no not tonight   No I can't run away   You put my gun away   You can't front on me.Do right by me and I'll never do you wrong..[Chorus:]   You are lying on the floor,   Trying to remember,   What happened the night before."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example “the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by”, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph..Pick me up, put me down   Push me in, turn me round   Switch me on, let me go   I have a mind of my own   In hiding   Far from the city of night   And the factories of truth   I stand upon the mountain   A million miles from my home   And the faces of fear   I have freedom to think   In hiding   I may take off my clothes   That I wear on my face   I float upon a river   A million miles from the plains   That are piercing the clouds   I am lost in the beauty   In hiding   Pick me up, put me down   Push me in, turn me round   Switch me on, let me go   I have a mind of my own   I wish you were here   In hiding   I lie silent at last   I am free from my past   I walk among the tall trees   This is beauty I know   I am in love with it all   I have freedom to love   In hiding   Pick me up, put me down   Push me in, turn me round   Switch me on, let me go   I have a mind of my own.Frosted window panes   Candles gleaming inside   Painted candy canes on the tree      Santa's on his way   He's filled his sleigh with things   Things for you and for me      It's that time of year   When the world falls in love   Every song you hear seems to say      Merry Christmas   May your New Year's dreams come true   And this song of mine   In three quarter time   Wishes you and yours   The same thing too!.Hey, where you gonna go for yourself?.Shelter us      He turns into the Sun for the world   Sun for the world   What would I say (what would I say)   Would it be me      Sun for the world   Sun for the world   What would you do (what would you do)   Would it be you, my friend      Leif   Help us   Shelter us      He turns into the Sun for the world   Sun for the world   What would I say (what would I say)   Would it be me      Sun for the world   Sun for the world   What would you do (what would you do)   Would it be you, my friend.He left with his brain smeared   All over his pants!"
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself..Lord, do I dare?.When I was seventeen   It was a very good year   It was a very good year for small town girls   And soft summer nights   We'd hide from the lights   On the village green   When I was seventeen      When I was twenty-one   It was a very good year   It was a very good year for city girls   Who lived up the stair   With all that perfumed hair   And it came undone   When I was twenty-one      When I was thirty-five   It was a very good year   It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls   Of independent means   We'd ride in limousines   And their chauffeurs would drive   When I was thirty-five      But now the days grow short   I'm in the autumn of my years   And I think of my life as vintage wine   From fine old kegs   From the brim to the dregs   And it poured sweet and clear   It was a very good year.Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey      Off through the new day's mist I run   Off from the new day's mist I have come   I hunt   Therefore I am   Harvest the land   Taking of the fallen lamb      Off through the new day's mist I run   Off from the new day's mist I have come   We shift   Pulsing with the earth   Company we keep   Roaming the land while you sleep      Shape shift, nose to the wind   Shape shift, feeling I've been   Move swift, all senses clean   Earth's gift, back to the meaning (back to the meaning) of life      Bright is the moon high in starlight   Chill is the air cold as steel tonight   We shift   Call of the wild   Fear in your eyes   It's later than you realized      Shape shift, nose to the wind   Shape shift, feeling I've been   Move swift, all senses clean   Earth's gift..See, I was touched by an angel   The day he took my hand..I see your red door and I want to paint it black   No colors anymore, I want them to turn black   I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes   I have to turn my head until my darkness goes   I see a line of cars and they're all painted black   With flowers and my love, both never to come back   I see people turn their heads and quickly look away   Never see the sight of me that changes every day   I want you to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black   Yeah, paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah   I want you to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah   No more will my dreams' eagle turn a deeper blue   (Handcuffed, handcuffed)   I could not foresee this thing happening to you   If I look hard enough into the setting sun   My love will laugh with me before the morning comes   I look inside myself and see my heart is black   I see my red door and it has been painted black   (Painted black)   Paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah   (Painted black)   Paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah   (Painted black)   Paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah   (Painted black)   Paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black as night, black as tar   (Painted black)   Wanna see the sun turnin' outside   (Painted black, painted black)   Paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black, yeah"
" The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says “Saeng vowed silently to herself “which means she wants what is best for herself..Oh I know it's hard for you to say it's over   Well it's twice as hard for me to let you go   Out there I hope you find a softer shoulder   But before you leave there's something you should know      [Chorus]   I was glad to give my everything to you   Yeah we almost made our every dream come true   And though we didn't have the chance to see it through   I was glad to give my everything to you      Oh you say you need a little room for breathing   Somehow I guess you know I'd understand   And though you're hurting me   I still can't help in believing   I'd be glad if I could do it all again      [Chorus]      Oh I was glad to give my everything to you.They call her the lady of the night   She's a woman of the world   And easy-living girl with love for sale      That's what they call her the lady of the night   No one seems to know her name   And even less about the place   From where she came      Every evening when the night is close at hand   You'll find the lady on the rue d'avignon   In a half lit hotel doorway the lady advertises warmly   It's just a job but she'll do the best she can      Don't try to change this lady of the night   She's a lot like you and me   And less than what she seems to be      (she is the lady of the night)   And easy-living girl   (she is the lady of the night)   She's a woman of the world   (she is the lady of the night)   With lots of loving for sale   (she is the lady of the night)   Lady lady of the night      Round here they call her the lady of the night   In a perfume hotel room   Shadows dance upon the wall and fate at dawn   She's no beginner this lady of the night   Never try that funny stuff   'cause lady can be tough   Be warned!.You been doin' the Shotgun,   Let me see you do the Twine,   Let's see the Watusi,   And the Action too,   Now hang on, baby,   I'll do the sloopy with you..You make me shiver, I feel so tender,   We make a pretty good team   Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,   You ought to get you some sleep      Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?.Everybody in the club in the heat   Pussy get to poppin' when we holdin' the beat   Bitches throwin' up, they posin' hands   Ass keep poppin' out these female pants      Every motherfucker sippin' on liquor   See the crunker they be gettin' when they be drinkin' a beer   And they be pullin' on a momma like, ""Bitch come here""   Pullin' on a momma like, ""Bitch come here""      I'm Santa Claus, didn't you hear?"
"  The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesn’t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother.Into the mercy seat I climb   My head is shaved, my head is wired   And like a moth that tries   To enter the bright eye   I go shuffling out of life   Just to hide in death awhile   And anyway I never lied..What's down?.December will be magic again..I drove all night crept in your room   Woke you from your sleep to make love to you   Is that all right?.We are the horsemen -- enter your spaceship!"
"The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng’s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph..Maybe you sucked the life right out of me..Some day you shall flee,   Panting and weak      Master passion greed      All within me gone but pain and hope   Hoping that the pain would fade away      Greed, your master passion   I Feed the mouth that bites me   Mammon, opiate of the masses   The reek of your lies draws flies      Seek her   Seduce her   Tame her   Blame her   Have her   Kill her   Feast on it all      With awakening the tears will begin   To my everlasting shame silence took me.My baby don't stand no cheatin', my babe   Oh yeah she don't stand no cheatin', my babe   Oh yeah she don't stand no cheatin',   She don't stand none of that midnight creepin'   My babe, true little baby, my babe      My babe, I know she love me, my babe   Oh yes, I know she love me, my babe   Oh yes, I know she love me,   She don't do nothin' but kiss and hug me   My babe, true little baby, my babe      My baby don't stand no cheatin', my babe   Oh no, she don't stand no cheatin', my babe   Oh no, she don't stand no cheatin',   Ev'rything she do she do so pleasin'   My babe, true little baby, my babe      My baby don't stand no foolin', my babe   Oh yeah, she don't stand no foolin', my babe   Oh yeah, she don't stand no foolin',   When she's hot there ain't no coolin'   My babe, true little baby, my babe   She's my baby (true little baby) ....I want to sho... ot the whole day down, down, down,   Shoot it all down, hi-yea, hey-yam..(Beyonce)   My niggers is home, I guess I got everything   Everything I want, but I don't   Know matter how good it gets it will never be like before   No women in the crowd, screaming and it's loud   Doing things not allowed   And I swear it's going down right now   I know one thing my momma would be proud   And you see me looking up   Cus I know she's looking down right now      (Charlie Wilson - Chorus)   I know you see me now right now,      (I know you see me now right now)   I know you see me now right now (Right now, right now)   I know you see me now right now (Right now)   I know you see me now right now      (Kanye - Verse 2)   Poor the champagne let your watch show   Shortie got a man watch, wrist look colossal   I admit my first watch was a fossil   Now I'm in the louvre looking for fossils   Attention to detail is so uncanny   And the whips on this?"
"I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,” In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .” mean that when all is @CAPS1 .” She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1.

" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending..I thought I knew all it took to bother you   Every word I said was true that you'll see      How could it be I'm the only one who sees your rehearsed insanity      I still refuse all the methods you've abused   It's all right if you're confused let me be      I've been around all the pawns   You've gagged and bound   They'll come back and knock you down and I'll be free      I've taken all and I've endured   One day it all will fade   I'm sure      I don't owe you anything      I had no other hand in your ever desperate plan   It returns and when it lands words are due      I should've known we were better off alone   I looked in and I was shown   You were too      I've taken all and I've endured   One day it all will fade   I'm sure      I don't owe you anything      I'll stick around and learn from all that came from it.I hate you, Can you feel the pain?...The letters and calls got you climbing the walls   And everyone wants a favor   They beg to remind you of times left behind you   But you know the past is a loser      The face you're wearing is different now   And the days run hot and cold   Are you under the power of gold?.Talk to me -- tell me your dreams   Am I in them?"
" The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think..To all of the faces that freeze for you there   In your memory when you try not to care   They never disappear down the slow road      For all of those people who bleed by the side   And split from their tongues   And sharpen their knives..The moment I entered the world of your vision   I swear that I started to shine   You feel like an angel descending from glory   To come like a dream into mine   Trembling and holding your breath at the wonder   Of hunger so holy and pure   Wild as the freedom I feel in my spirit   So tightly entangled in yours..How's about cookin' something up with me?.Every thing you say to me   Takes me one step closer to the edge   And I'm about to break!.I'd do more, I'd do it with a smile."
" Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better..I was chained   Chained   Chained to my broken dreams   I

" The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test..Everyone asks what you're doing with me   I know this is not what they want   They're afraid you've been blinded   But I already know how it's going to be   If anyone should ask   Say we're mated   For as long as this life lasts   We are mated   Why else would you be here right now   And you know we'll still be here tomorrow   Nobody else understands what I'm doing   Nobody else makes me act in this way   And because they can't comprehend   What we mean to each other   They won't leave you alone   So you know what to say   I hold you in my heart   'Cause we're mated   In a very special part   We are mated   Why else would I be here right now   And you know I'll still be here tomorrow   I see things far ahead, maybe light   Maybe beautiful children   I don't have words I'm thinking of   But it's way beyond what they call love.My black backpack's stuffed with broken dreams   Twenty bucks should get me through the week   Never said a word of discontentment   Thought it a thousand times but now I'm leaving home      Here in my shadows   I'm safe, I'm free   I've nowhere else to go but   I cannot stay where I don't belong      Two months pass by and it's getting cold   I know I'm not lost, I'm just alone   But I won't cry, I won't give up, I can't go back now   Waking up is knowing who you really are      Here in my shadows   I'm safe, I'm free   I've nowhere else to go but   I cannot stay where I don't belong      In the shadows   I'm safe, I'm free   I've nowhere else to go but   I cannot stay here      Show me the shadow where true meaning lies   So much more dismay in empty eyes.But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently   She tempt me   Right then I stopped thinking consequences   Guess I must've lost my mind for a minute      [Chorus]   There's no better love   Girl, I love you   With her that was lust   Yeah   Shouldn't have been   I know I messed up   Yeah   One phone call   Started this whole thing   Now look at the damage (the damage)   Look at the damage (the damage)   The damage   Damage that I've caused you (that I've caused you)   I know I broke your heart   Cause I did you wrong   Now look at the damage   Look at the damage that I've caused      The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of   A few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love   I gotta live with regret   Deserve to get what you get   Now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying   I rode past your house for hours   Just to feel close to ya   No car, no gift, no flowers   Could get me back with you   Your kiss, your touch   Girl, you know I miss it   But you got my heart   Inside of a prison      [Chorus]      I was trippin'   I was dippin'   With these women   In these streets   Lost my girl   Lost all that   Wish I could   Take it back      I was trippin'   I was dippin'   With these women   In these streets   Wish I could   Take that back      [Chorus]      Look at the damage   Look at the damage      You know   Sometimes you don't realize what you've done   Until you've seen the damage   And now I look at the damage.I can feel your hate in my soul, I wonder what it is you know      Black Devil... what's going on?.Anywhere you fancy going   And anyway with me's alright   My darling, don't you ever change   I don't think I'd be quite the same   I thought I was in control   I thought I was in control   My darling, don't you ever change   I don't think I'd be quite the same   I thought I was in control   I thought I was in control"
" the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng’s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test..The dawn has come   And the wine will run   And the song must be sung   And the flowers are melting   In the sun      I feel I want to be up on the roof   I feel I gotta get up on the roof   Up, up on the roof   Up, up on the roof      Oh the dawn has come   And the song must be sung   And the flowers are melting   What kind of language is this?.the avenger, midnight defender..Is he one of the usual crowd?.Be not afraid at all, be not afraid to know   And ride the wings of change, to a better time   Come take the hand of hope, and learn the ways of man   For you're the path that leads to the other side   The skin upon our faces has melt the ice of ages   Now our destiny is yours      [Chorus]   Children lift up your eyes to the heavens   Send your vision out beyond   Children take up the torch and we will follow   You're the light of the world      Hear echoes in the dark from voices of the heart   You teach the song of life we take for granted   We've given you the key, so you'll unlock the door   We're looking through your eyes to another day   You bring a change of season, something to believe in   Now our destiny is yours      Children lift up your eyes to the heavens   Send your vision out beyond   Children take up the torch and we will follow   Bring some light into this world      Be not afraid at all, be not afraid to show   Your voices will be heard, wish I learned   We shelter from the storm, we can't make it on our own   So lift our spirit to the other side      Children lead us away from the sorrow   You're the arrows from the bow   Another kingdom awaits your arrival   Giving freedom to the soul      Let the children follow, let the children see   All the children walk to the other side   Let the children follow, let the children see   All the children walk to the other side      Let the children follow, let the children see   All the children walk to the other side   Let the children follow, let the children see   All the children walk to the other side   Let the children follow, let the children see.The city in defeat,   With no one left to beat   There's still a fading desire   To burn a naked light   Just to defy the night      Come on and call me a liar   A crumble tumble down   In fumble bumble town   Our lives a ruin   We reconstruct a bit   And pretty up a bit   We hardly know what we're doing      [Chorus: ]   But me and my baby   Make the best of this world   She's like a diamond   Innocent girl   We watch the sign of the times   Writing on the wall, cities may fall      Back through the city fog   I was another cog   For the machinery there   Now the machines have gone   The silence hanging on   I sit, I stare      [Chorus: ]      Come on and take your aim   I feel the mildest pain   Protecting something so rare   'Cause there's a gem or two   Inside the human zoo   If only you are aware      [Chorus: ]"
"I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph..She look good, she bad as a motherfucka   She look good?.Yeah, it's Halloween   Yeah, it's Halloween tonight.I can remember when,   In the unity of our five-day sessions   Not even once did we hear the siren song   What kind of imagination   Asleep in some lyrical coma   Who's vain futile memory   Could have been so wrong?.Tell me why will you never come home?.When the mob came and got her   And dragged her from the jail,   Madam,   They strung her upon   The old willow across the way,   And the moment before she died   She lifted up her head and cried,   Madam,   ""Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today."""
" The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can’t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test..Speak to me   Speak to me heart   I feel a needing   To bridge the clouds   Softly go   A way I wish to know   A way I wish to know      Oh you'll ride   Surely dance   In a ring   Backwards and forwards   Those who seek   Feel the glow   A glow we will all know   A glow we will all know      On that day   Filled with grace   And the heart's communion   Steps we take   Steps we trace   Into the light of reunion      Paths that cross   Will cross again   Paths that cross   Will cross again      Speak to me   Speak to me shadow   I spin from the wheel   Nothing at all   Save the need   The need to weave   A silk of souls   That whisper whisper   A silk of souls   That whispers to me      Speak to me heart   All things renew   Hearts will mend   Round the bend   Paths that cross   Cross again   Paths that cross   Will cross again      Rise up hold the reins   We'll meet again I don't know when   Hold tight bye bye   Paths that cross   Will cross again   Paths that cross   Will cross again.With, without..She wakes up   Rage and grace   Pulling me closer, pushing away   And me   The sharpest thorn on your vine   Twisting and turning   We're all intertwined      Broken wing   Empty glass   Words that scream and bounce right back   She says, you know   We'd all like to rearrange      I wish I could fix you   And make you how I want you   I wish I could fix you   And I wish you could fix me      I wish I could heal you   And mend where you are broken   I wish I could heal you   And I wish you could heal me      HA la la la...      A beaming sunrise buries the night   The setting sun destroys the light   The she says, baby   I've gotta get going   Cutting each other   Without even knowing      She sees a million stars   Like holes in the sky   All God's tears for her they cry   And I am in her rain.I was serious with a furrowed brow   I just fell in love what do I do now?.Unbridled night mares powerful and running free."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. “Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,” in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because she failed the test. Saeng failed to fine the fine–toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding..Good night!).There's a place in the stars,   For when you get old..It all comes from the top and it spreads right round   Treat a man wrong he's gonna pass it on down   To the next in line, who's probably his wife bringing up his kids   Now watchin' mamma cry   And they pick it up, cause they learn everything   Life has a funny way of going in a ring,   End up growing up in trouble with the law   Standing in the cuffs that the father once wore   Now it seems that every brand new generation   Have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation   Their trying to fill the holes of a whole damn nation   That's lost its trust (that's lost its trust)   We gotta change before the train leaves the station   And realize the revolution ain't a revelation it takes blood,sweat, tears, innovation   It starts with us, it starts with us..[Chorus]      Cherry, oh, Cherry, oh, baby,   Don't you know I'm in love with you?.Got owned by the Parthian Persians,   They killed me, but you'll hear two versions."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 “In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It means she’ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she’s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it..Papers      I can't, get to work on time,   Can't believe the words to her I just said   But who the hell argue 'n fight like dogs at 6 in the morning?.How can you stand there and deny it?.Down the road I look and there runs Mary   Hair of gold and lips like cherries   We go down to the river where the willows weep   Take a naked root for a lovers seat   That rose out of the bitten soil   But sound to the ground by creeping ivy coils   O Mary you have seduced my soul   And I don't know right from wrong   Forever a hostage of your child's world      And then I ran my tin-cup heart along   The prison of her ribs   And with a toss of her curls   That little girl goes wading in   Rollin her dress up past her knee   Turning these waters into wine   Then she platted all the willow vines      Mary in the shallows laughing   Over where the carp dart   Spooked by the new shadows that she cast   Across these sad waters and across my heart.Cherry red bleeding burn      Like an angry apple tree   I throw my apples if you get to close to me   But if I look to my right   Will I see the one I fight for?.I don't need no one to hack around and make...   Just makes me look older!"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the “test” again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality..I tell her I never leave again..Why did you keep me waiting so long?.[Chorus]   Can't get you out of my heart, can't get you out of my soul   When I get next to you, all I get is out of control   Can't get you out of my head, I've memorized every word you ever said   You've been here from the start, can't get you out of my heart      Sometimes I feel like breakin' up with you   I'm tired of bein' true, tired of bein' blue   Still you're the one I give my best love to   No other girl would do the things to me you do, and I      [Chorus]      Sometimes I think I might be better off free   No strings attached to me, yeah that's how it should be   But just about the time that I get goin'   You read me like a poem, you keep me comin' home, and I      [Chorus]      I look at you sometimes, I see the woman I love   But I can be so blind, the good times I sometimes lose sight of      [Chorus: x3].And I fell in love with my very best friend   I didn't realise that our friendship would end..[Mary J. Blige]   All my love is all I have   All my life I look for you      [Fabolous]   I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now   But I can barely be found   And I rarely be round   But when I do, the jury be drowned   And you can see how clear the Pile Vase, and the Canaries be now   The top on the 5 series be down   And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now   Although there was a time I would barely see fowls   But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now   Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now   Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now   That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now   And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds   I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now   Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round   Everybody staring unnecessarily now   But there's no tints on my lights, so you can clearly see now      [Chorus: Mary J. Blige]   All my love is all I have   And my dreams are very special   All my life I looked for you   And today your dream come true   You need me and I need you   Lovin' us is very special   Lovin' life and life and livin'   Your very special      [Fabolous]   Y'all can never be built like me, even if Y'all look at my blueprint   But since Y'all watches look like its movement   I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint   Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent   100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint   Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints   I stay away from anythin' that look like a nuisance   But y'all gotta peep this rookie's improvement   I tip it with you and   Cause most dudes was doin' verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents   All I do is try to teach and look to influence   But it look like the students are playin' hooky, and truin'   And some say that we lookin' like new gents   But money talks, and it don't look like Y'all fluent   And Y'all done seen how this young'n look in the new pints   But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints      [Chorus]      [Fabolous]   Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way   Even though I feel like the same old John J.   Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray   When I eat, I order the same old entree   When I ride, I let the same old songs play   And when I work, I do the same old long days   From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way   They know where we came, from the name they call me   I already know what these lames is gonna say   And I already seen what games they gonna play   Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way   And when you die, Y'all crackers gonna blame it on strays      [Mary J. Blige]   Cause love is life, and life is livin'   Your very special   [harmonizing]      [Chorus]      Me and Fab are very special   Me and Fab are very special"
" I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  .Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl   Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow cause she's just a honky tonk girl   Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun   She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one   She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl   Cause she's just a honky tonk girl      She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world   She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new   Cause she's just a honky tonk girl   Breaking hearts to her.Well, if you want to rock   I got to be your rockin' horse   If you want to roll, Lord   I could roll you   Right out the door, yes I could   We'll shake the world, yeah   When it's time to crash   But when I get home tonight, Lord   I guess I got to shake myself lookie here   You need some lovin'   You must have the blues   You fucked your mind baby   It's a good thing to do   Now do the shake   The rattlesnake shake   Now do the shake   Yes, chuck away 'dem blues   Chuck dem blues   You need some lovin', you must have the blues   You fucked your mind baby   It's a good thing to do   Do the shake, oh   The rattlesnake shake   Now do the shake, yeah   Chuck away, chuck away   Chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck.Did I really want you gone?.From the red sky of the east   To the sunset in the west   We have cheated death   And he has cheated us      But that was just a dream   And this is what it means   We are sleeping   And we'll dream for evermore      And the fragment remains of our memories   And the shadows remain with our hands   Deep gray, came to mourn   All the colors of the dawn   Will this journeyman's day be his last?.It's only that I understand the man that the monkey can leave behind,   I used to think he was a friend of mine."
" Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story..Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma,   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma,   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma,   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma   Ma-ma-ma-ma ma-ma-ma-ma-ma      Oh, beautiful lana   I told it my mama   And my dad   What I had      Was the sweetest   And the neatest   Little girl   In the world      Oh la-la-la-la lana   La-la-la-la lana   Hey hey lana   He- he- hey      O- oh lana   Don't make me blue   O- oh lana   Don't you know   Don't you know   I love you      Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ma-ma-ma-ma ma-ma-ma-ma-ma      Oh beautiful lana   Don't you know that I want to   Hug and kiss you   Let you know that I miss you   While we're apart   Oh my heart   All it can say is      L-a-n-a   L-a-n-a   L-a-n-a   L-a-n-a   Oh la-la-la-la lana   La-la-la-la-lana   Oh la-la-la-la lana   La-la-la-la lana   Hey hey lana   He- he- hey.Sambora      Theres a danger of getting so close to you   There comes a time   When the walls fade away   And when love turns to bitter blue   Sometimes it feels like its so hard to stay   Last night we went to bed angry   We didint mean what we said   Seems we never get past forgiveness   We try to hide, we never learn   To swallow our pride..Make me free (and)      [Chorus]      You are Holy   You are Holy   Yes You are Holy   You are Holy   You are Holy   Holy      [Chorus]      You are Holy   You are Holy   Yes You are Holy   You are Holy   You are Holy   Holy.Supermarket flashbacks   Show arms and legs in plastic sacks   Fat men twelve bananas high   Die while all the women cry   Love-love gets sucked away   On big fat lips while people pray   Boy plus girl make mess out of sex   No babies come   What happens next   De-evolution self-execution no-solution   I'm a potato and I'm so hip   Teenage hoodlums stand in line   Donate blood to pay for crime   Butchers steal doctor's tools   Sow pretty heads on dogs and mules   Hi-fi systems men in pairs   Tape bodies falling down the stairs   Father-son teams split the cost of nighttime girls but all is lost   To de-evolution self-execution   No-solution   I'm a spudman I got eyes all around   Martian feet turn dirt and stone   For buried treasure human bone   Madison men tattoo ads on   Ten year olds with sucker pads   Rockets rust attack decay things   Fall apart while spacemen play   Now daddy zero drops his brown   Godowngodowngodown   To de-evolution self-execution   No-solution   I'm a spudgun I'd like to shoot'em all!.Chorus:   Now Solitaire's the only game in town and   Every road that takes me takes me down,   I find myself that's easy to pretend I'm coming back   Again and deep into myself I play the game without   You love it always ends the same,   While life goes all around me everywhere, I'm playing Solitaire."
" The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place..Touch and kiss me   Touch and kiss me   Up and down   Touch and feel me   Up and down      Touch and kiss me   Touch and kiss me   Up and down   Touch and feel me   Up and down      I'll always love you      Touch and kiss me   Touch and kiss me   Up and down   Touch and feel me   Up and down      Touch and kiss me   Touch and feel me   Touch and kiss me   Touch and kiss me   Up and down      Touch and kiss me   Touch and feel me.Slipping in the unknown..The sweetness of your tears make it feel like night..What's true, hey way?.2:      Abbaz Chiyad, Tha one that never gon change   Cant stop makin music, lyrics comin to me like i'm nobody strange   Tryin to be famous, it's only ma life that is'nt glarious   Tryin to be good, tryin to forget that time wer A-Double-B   Was blowin up he's enemies in tha hood   New Kid On Tha Glock brought me up, started rappin on beats from Shownuff   You remember me, from Rais to Outlaw   New album (Guess Whos Back), that's what i'ma bout more   Even if death come to me, i aint got nothin to fear   And i know there's gon happend some wrong this year   Now haters wanna get along, from today till tha day i die   I'm gon live strong      Chours."
" She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it..It's Trying times when the I'll winds blow..We met down in the valley, where the wine of love and destruction flows   There in that curve of darkness where flowers of temptation grow   I left the rest for the others it was you and nothing else   You felt so good to me baby, as good as life itself      You were life itself, rushing over me   Life itself, the wind in the black elms   Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes   I can't make it without you      I knew you were in trouble, anyone could tell   You carried your little black book from which all your secrets fell   You squandered all your riches, your love, your beauty and your wealth   Like you had no further use for, for life itself      You were life itself, rushing over me   Life itself, the wind in the black elms   Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes   I can't make it without you      Why the things that we treasure most slip away in time   'Til to the music we grow deaf and to god's beauty blind   Why do the things that connect us slowly pull us apart   'Til we fall away in our own darkness, stranger to our own hearts      And to life itself, rushing over me   Life itself, the wind in the black elms   Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes   I can't make it without you      So here's one for the road   Here's one to your health   And to life itself, rushing over me   Life itself, the wind in the black elms   Life itself, in your heart and in your eyes   I can't make it without you      Life itself   Life itself   Life itself   Life itself.Days may be cloudy or sunny   We're in or we're out of the money   But I'm with you always   I'm with you rain or shine!.It's something like I apologize   It's something I still can't decide   But I know it gets better   It only gets better      And I want to say that it's not always easy   But it's simple that way   And I want to stay and play it out   But I still have my doubts   So you say it gets better   It only gets better   Better this way   Better, maybe it's better this way      Beautiful things they never stay, oh, the same way   They pass, oh they pass away, they always change   Who are we is who we are   When the act of love can get us so far   So good I wish you would   Think twice on me   'cause it only gets better      It only gets better   Better this way   Better, maybe it's better this way   Just give it some time   Just give it some space   Just give it some time, maybe it's better this way   Just give it some time   Just give it some space   Just give it some time, maybe it's better this way      So better   It's better this way   Baby, it's better this way   Just give it some time   Just give it some space   Maybe, yes maybe, yes maybe, yes maybe   It's better, oh, this way   Promise me you'll always be better   Better      Written by: Jason Mraz.What's the sense of running blind   If you never know where you go   What's the sense of a suicide   If the crash is all you know   I'm a right down, lower than the low   Collecting other people's sins   What's the sense if you got to go   If you don't know where you been   A classic indication, march out of time   A standard application, you're not the kind   I'm coming   Blessed retribution, head on, never stall   Running head on to the wall   Unholy damn solution, head on, never fall   Running head on to the wall   All the promises that you made   Made you right with what you did   All the freedoms that you trade   On the block for the highest bid   I'm an up here higher than high sight   On a self-inflicted grin   With a back door larger than life light   So you can see where you been   A classic indication, march out of time   A standard application, you're not the kind   I'm coming   Blessed retribution, head on, never stall   Running head on to the wall   Unholy damn solution, head on, never fall   Running head on to the wall   c'mon now baby shine a light on me   Can you see me just a little bit?"
"The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again..Ov'??....Break away..My love, my darling,   I hunger for your touch,   Alone..Who do you look up to when you're better then your idols..Wait!"
"The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means..Well, I was feelin' so bad, asked my family doctor 'bout what I had,   I said, ""doctor, doctor, mister m.d., can you tell me, what's ailing me?"".I go back to December all the time..Verse 1   Justice beckons for those who glory in their shame   Hell enlarges for sinners to quickly claim   And while this happens e pray to be blessed,   With eyes ignoring the ripe harvest      Chorus   Lord give me a piece of your desire   And let it become all mine   Take the eyes off me, so I can see souls dying   Let me labor for this gospel   Without a pause or refrain   Give me love for the harvest   Lest my labor be in vain   Lest my labor be in vain      Verse 2   And it's almost time for Gabriel's trumpet to resound,   Heralding the time when the saints of God receive a crown   And as I step forward to receive my life's reward,   I must have a soul with me to present to the Lord      Bridge   It's harvest time..Catch a boat to England, baby,   Maybe to Spain,   Wherever I have gone,   Wherever I've been and gone,   Wherever I have gone   The blues, they're all the same..To them I always say      Are you hungry?"
" The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she’s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she’s not giving up “…then I will take that teat again” which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph..We're already dead!.no man, hey, wait up   [Verse 4]   Now it's saturday, the day you hate most   Why, because from coast to coast   You see girls everday in the club, cold kickin' it   Reminds you of baby when you used to be with it   But now she took you one time for sex and you're so sprung   That the next time she seen you   We knew, She had to leave you   Boy, you're hooked   Boy, you're hooked, hooked hooked.One cries foul   And will not speak   The other claims a little victory   And all the time   You know we fail to see   This is the language of love..I gave in when you gave out   You showed me the way to love   There ain't no doubt   Always together and never apart      Disappeared, didn't say a word   Slept right through, guess I never heard   Now I'm awake but I wish I was dreamin'      Everyday without you in my heart   Everyday I'm fallin' apart   And I know you know I think about you   Everyday      I woke up and you were gone   Just one night without you   Is too long      Sleeping with the ghost of you   Dying with or without you   Don't want to feel this way tomorrow      Everyday without you in my heart   Everyday I'm fallin' apart   And I know you know I think about you   Everyday      Don't know what you got until it's gone      Everyday without you in my heart   Everyday I'm fallin' apart   And I know you know I think about you   Everyday 'til I see you again   Everyday I'll try to pretend   That I know you know I think about you      Everyday   Outta my head all the days are confused   Everyday   I'm lost but it's you that I don't want to lose   Everyday   We're torn 'til we're givin' ourselves to each other.Better men have realized alone is not a venture,   A decent man would realize alone is not a venture,   Just to hide away, hide away."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.” She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her..Say it isn't right   To be alone tonight   So in love with you   Tell you what I'm gonna   Do about it      I had an idea   Based on a love theme   I had an idea   Based on a love theme      All I ever do   Is what you want me to   So in love with you   Tell you what I'm gonna   Do about it      I had an idea   Based on a love theme   I had an idea   Based on a love theme      Say it isn't right   To be alone tonight   So in love with you   Tell you what I'm gonna   Do about it      I had an idea   Based on a love theme   I had an idea   Based on a love theme.People do..Well, if you're ever in los angeles   And you've got time to spare   Take a stroll up sunset boulevard   You'll find the whiskey there   Gliding round the tables   With wounderous natural ease   Serving two-star brandy   Is the body you have to see...all belonging to      Long-legged linda   She sure was worth the flight   Long-legged linda is playing the whiskey   Tonight      Oh don't boogie-woogie with linda   'tho she dances like a dream   She acts like she's a thousand   But she's barely sweet sixten   She re-arranged my brain-cells   And took control of me   So if I miss my plain to jacksonville   You can guess where I'll still be...i'll be diggin'      Long-legged linda   She sure was worth the flight   Long-legged linda is playing the whiskey   Tonight      She re-arranged my brain-cells   And took control of me   So if I miss my plain to jacksonville   You can guess where I'll still be...i'll be diggin'      Long-legged linda   She sure was worth the flight   Long-legged linda is playing the whiskey   Tonight      Long-legged linda   She sure was worth the flight   Long-legged linda is playing the whiskey   Tonight      Long-legged linda   Long-legged linda   Long-legged linda   Long-legged ......Well, so do I   Such a quiet evaporation      We're nothing but hollow vessels in search   Of what makes us alive   I never said this was my revolution when   You looked me in the eye   Oh, how I've walked this white line so   Many times before   What a feeble attempt just to feel alive      This is for you and your hopeless case   You never would leave me in your wish to   Fail every time   Every time I try      So talk about it   At least it makes you feel something inside      Who have I become   Oh God, everything all around me is   Crumbling at my feet      I stare so delicate and ashamed   At the shell I've shed myself from      In the eyes of my ghost   And I will never look back again.Hen goes chimmy-chuck, chimmy-chuck,   Cat goes fiddle-i-fee."
" The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience..Answer to the master      Can you look to the sky?.Mine has a hood, and I lie in bed,   And pull the hood right over my head,   And I shut my eyes and I curl up small,   And nobody knows that I'm there at all..Future's bright   For me alright   I close my eyes   You saw the light   Here it's dark   And I'm so blue   Here it's cold   Wanting you      I love you   Oh, I love you so   God, give me   Some control.There's no peace..I said, I just got back from baby's,   Big white house on the hill."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do..Momma said it'd be days like this   Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss   She said ""Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall   All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers""   It's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket   If it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it   Fuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat   Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets   They keep callin' me   They keep callin', all the lil' homies keep fallin'   In them same traps niggas can't figure out   In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out   Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled   Get you in the system, get you in the soil   And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal   Saw you UVN, nigga digital      [Chorus]      I know, it's fucked up how they do us   Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis   Take that money that was allocated to us   Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us   Watchin' Katrina, is worser than Ike and Tina   See New Orleans get bitch-slapped by FEMA   Louisiana got racist-ass politics   Free the Jena Six (Nigga free the Jena six!).Will it buy you forgiveness?.flakes!.No one can stop me know   I'm like a human dynamo   Live wired and chargin' out with power   This time I won't hold back   I'm rarin' to get up and go   Fuelled up and growin' by the hour      Look out   I'm blastin' through the lines   Alive and kickin'   Watch out   I'm young and lethal   I'm goin' from here until eternity      I'm feelin' reckless   Way outa hand, a real survivor   Reckless   Comin' at gale force ten      Around me I feel the shock waves,   Building for the energy   A force field no one can break through   Solid as rock no wonder   I am indestructible   First placed in everything I do      Look out   I'm blastin' through the lines   Alive and kickin'   Watch out   I'm young and lethal   I'm goin' from here until eternity      I'm feelin' reckless   Way outa hand, a real survivor   Reckless   Comin' at gale force ten      Radioactive   I'm shootin' through the atmosphere   Takin' off   I'm headin' like a rocket through the stratosphere..Are you high right now?"
" She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder. .Wings of vengeance draw nigh   Wings of vengeance on high      [Chorus]   We rule the night   We rule the night   We rule the night   You and I      Marching on to victory   Your path is paved with scars   A victim of illusion   You shoot far- so far   Oh, but your reach   Should always exceed your your grasp   Or what's a heaven for   But to last- to last   Die free!.Girl oo oo baby..Ramble on baby, settle down easy   Ramble on rose..I don't think so   You should see more..no I don't think so   How could you be sure..I believe him   You're in for heartbeat you don't need him   What if he hurts you..he won't do that   Are you sure...yeah that's a fact   There's lots of guys in this world   Not for me, I'm a one-boy-girl      No other love (no other love)   My lover, ohh   One boy, one boy girl   No other touch (no other touch)   My lover, ohh   One boy, one boy girl, yeah      CHORUS.He's a-walking away   From what we've seen."
" I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn’t mean her lifes over.

"The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things.Where I come up, we share the mortar and the glue..Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?.Keep you distance 'cause it's rubbing off..Don't need for me to write it   I just gotta picture her smiling,   And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby!.[Intro]   You really messed up everything   You really messed up everything   If you could take it all back again   Strike up the tinderbox   Why should I be good if you're not?"
" The story “Winter Hibiscus” is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring..So she'll take everything,   Everything and nothing..""What's that on that tape?"".Yesterday, remember how clear it seemed   In six inch heels, quoting magazines   Go all the way, you knew you could   So far, so good      Someone asked: Who do you think you are?.You keep your pretty girls   Chained inside the dungeon   And diamonds and pearls   You keep them a'coming   Give them all of your affection      You keep your naughty boys   Locked inside the kitchen   And when they make a noise   A swish of your hand keeps them   Screaming out for your affection      I don't know the why or wherefores   I don't what's wrong or right   I just know at night   You give them all of your affection      You keep your servants down   Swinging from the gallows   And when they come round   Oh you smile and you say hello   Give them all of your affection   You give them all of your affection   You give them all of your affection.Right at the front door I recognized the perfume   The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon   There must be many ways to ask her to my room   Why didn't I dare?"
" The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test..And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them..Could it be   The rescue that you need?.But I'm afraid there's always something,   That sets me back and makes me see..When passion shines her blinding light on you   You know my friend there's nothing that you can really do   Just follow on behind her veil of deepest purple haze   Down, to love's strange ways      Drowning in a laughter as you go   Intoxicating laughter that spins you high and low   Dangerous times are these, but oh so wonderfully new   Laugh along you fool, can't you they're laughing at you   Lost in the haze   Of love's strange ways      Ain't it funny how it turns   When it's all over, nothing's learned   Just a passion and a fool   And a memory that burns   And that's what you get   When you play with love's strange ways.Performed by barbra streisand   Four little angels of peace are we   Loving our neighbors so peacefully   There's really no harm if we do not disarm   For we always in close harmony   Four little angels of peace are we   There is one thing on which we agree   With fall or with friend   We will fight to the end   Just for peace, peace, peace..."
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time..FREE THE THREE.As I look back on my life (check it)   To get where I am I had to sacrifice   You slammed my name in your magazine   This business gets hard tryin' to stay a queen   You're checkin' for me, you need to check yourself   (Ooh, check yourself)   And be someone, not someone else   (Ooh, someone else)      Refugees go 'head and do it   Paper   Go 'head and do it.I have never wanted any other girl,   The way I want you, baby..I love to see you sitting there upon your throne,   Your preachers all around you   Being bored, and your prophet straight and tall..How do you do what you do to me?"
"The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won’t spend so much time dreaming about her past. “And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.” I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life..I want to need you,   Cause I need to   Be with you 'til the end..Does he know?.She's just a working girl from Baltimore   She'll choose you   She's been there   She's been there and back again      It's in and out   It's up it's down   It's a mercenary   And you get what you need      When you walk on the streets of paradise   In vogue in the streets   Indecision   Yeah yeah yeah      White heat   In fashion   She'll take you home   She'll take you where you want to get back to      You're sweet sixteen   But you'll be a man tonight   It's to the wall   It's to the floor      She's in a hurry   But you get what you pay for   When you live on the streets of paradise   In heat in vogue      Impassioned   Yeah yeah yeah   White heat in fashion   Hard cash      Indiscrete   Wild passion   In heat   In vogue      In fashion   White heat   Cold passion   8th Avenue indecision      In heat on the street in fashion   In vogue in style   White heat cool looks hard cash   On the street      In vogue in style indiscretion   In trains in bars in heat   White heat   In vogue in fashion      Hard cash indiscrete wild passion   White heat in fashion   White heat in fashion   White heat in fashion      White heat indiscrete ignition.I promise you, we gon' see the world   But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby      I mean this      Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?.I'll be waiting   I'll be waiting on that shore   To hear the cry for home   You won't have to worry anymore   When you hear the cry for home      When you hear, hear the call   You won't have to fake at all   Hear the cry for home      I'll be standing   I'll be standing within reach   When you hear, hear the call      I'll be waiting   I'll be waiting in the breach   For you, when you hear      When you hear, hear the call   You won't have to fake at all   Hear the cry for home      When I listen   When I listen to the song   Well it feels, it feels so free      And you tell me   You will come and go with me   When you hear the cry for home      When you hear the call   You won't have to think at all   Hear the cry for home   Spoken (one more, one more time)   When you hear, hear the call   You won't have to fake at all   Hear the cry for home   (One more open it up, open it up)   When you hear, hear the call   You won't have to fake at all   Hear the cry for home   Hear (When you hear, hear the call)   Hear (When you hear, hear the call)   Hear (When you hear, hear the call)   Hear (When you hear, hear the call)   Hear (When you hear, hear the call)   Hear (When you hear, hear the call)"
"In the story “Winter Hibiscus” it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and this is why the author concluded it this way..In detroit 442 maybe baby I could ride with you..Of Word, Inc.), Shepherd Boy Music (adm.

" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways..Lest you forget, my dear, let me remind you, girl   You may as well resign yourself to me..Mobil station where I stand   This old gas pump in my hand   My boss don't like me, got a face like a weasel   Oil on my hands and the smell of diesel   Here comes a big shot from the city   V8 engine, she runs so pretty   'Fill her up son, unleaded   I need a full tank of gas where I'm headed'   Up in the front seat a pretty red head   'We're going to Vegas we're gonna get wed'   'So fill her up son, don't be staring   That's a real diamond she be wearing'   I'm gonna take my baby one day   I'm gonna fill her up and head west   I'm going find some money all right   See those tail lights heading west   I got no money to invest   Got no prospects, no education   I was lucky getting a job at this gas station   That old cash box on the top shelf   The boss is sleeping, I'll just help myself   Let's consider this as just a loan   I can sort it out later on the phone   I'm gonna pick my girl up tonight   I'm gonna fill her up and head west   I'm gonna show her all the bright lights   We're gonna say we lived 'for we come home   And as I head through the woods on the way back   The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty   It's like I walked into a glade of heaven   And there's music playing   This money is cold in my hand   And a voice somewhere is saying   'Why would you wanna take that stolen thing   And what real happiness can it bring?'.Chicago's own killer dillers, those sintilating sinners Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly..I'll be the wall that protects you   From the wind and the rain,   From the hurt and pain..no!"

" The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she’ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she’ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn’t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  .Baby I've grown into a man who knows the deal   (playn around)   My emotions is a thing of the past, sorry..Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned..Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside   Painted candy canes on the tree   Santa's on his way he's filled his sleigh with things   Things for you and for me      It's that time of year when the world falls in love   Every song you hear seems to say   ""Merry Christmas, may your new year dreams come true""   And this song of mine in three quarter time   Wishing you and yours the same thing too      Happy holidays there is snow in the air   Silver bells and sleighs everywhere   People that you meet on any street will smile   It's the season to care      There are songs to sing every family?s a choir   Toys to wrap and bring to the tree   Your own wishing star is not so far from view   Wish a wish or two and I promise you   Christmas wishes can and do come true.Sur mon front je sens tes caresses..Zazou, what you're gonna do?"

" In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her..Dear when I dance with you   We move like the sea   You, you're all I want to know   I feel free   I feel free   I can walk down the street   There's no one there   The pavement is one huge crowd   I can drive down the road   My eyes can't see   But my mind wants to cry out loud   I can walk down the street   There's no one there   The pavement is one huge crowd   I can drive down the road   My eyes can't see   But my mind wants to cry out loud   My mind wants to cry out loud   I feel free   Dance floor is like the sea   The ceiling is the sky   You're the sun, and as you shine on me   I feel free   I feel free   I feel free.I find some loose change every day   Under that Coke machine..Makes a treat each week, tomorrow sits at home..And I just wanna leave   Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave..Had you been there tonight   You might also have known   How the world may be changed   In just one burst of light!"
"In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that “why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome..Know every station off by heart..'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,   Yhere's not another living soul around,   You woo me until the sun comes up,   And you say that you love me..And your bullets keep knocking me down      Hey, I pick up my axe and fight like a bomber now   Yeah, but you still blast me down to the ground      The same way you shoot me down, baby   you'll be going just the same   Three times the pain,   and your own self to blame   Hey, Machine Gun      I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe   I ain't afraid no more   After a while, your, your cheap talk don't even cause me pain,   so let your bullets fly like rain      'Cause I know all the time you're wrong baby   And you'll be going just the same   Yeah, Machine Gun   Tearing my family apart   Yeah, yeah, alright   Tearing my family apart      (Don't you shoot him down)   (He's 'bout to leave here)   (Don't you shoot him down)   (He's got to stay here)   (He ain't going nowhere)   (He's been shot down to the ground)   (Oh where he can't survive, no, no)      Yeah, that's what we don't want to hear anymore, alright   (No bullets)   At least here, huh huh   (No guns, no bombs)   Huh huh   (No nothin', just let's all live and live)   (You know, instead of killin').To find a world of your own..Tryin' to, tryin' to get away."
"In the story “winter Hibiscus“ by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life but she failed. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again when the plant is in bloom..I recall something strange coming over me, somewhat at a loss for words..When the rain comes,   They run and hide their head,   Might as well be dead,   When the rain comes,   When the rain comes..Anytime just tell me   Your problems   And you'll find out, baby, I'll solve 'em..I can't find me anybody to love me   And I've looked around,   I've looked everywhere, everywhere   And I can't find me anyone to love,   To feel my care..Yes, how many years can some people exist   Before they're allowed to be free?"
" So she saying she will take the test next year..First your dead kings lain on a table where his brain,   Is pull out with a wire through his nose!.Stupid..Anything you want   Everything you need   Every time you take   What's on offer      You can step on out   You can do without   You don't have to be   Like every other      Don't dance to the rhythm   Do something 'bout it   Don't dance to the rhythm   You can do without it      Always stay in line   Fool you every time   Wonder why it ends up in sorrow   You don't have to go      All you say is no   There's no rhythm that you have to follow   Don't dance to the rhythm   Do something 'bout it      Don't dance to the rhythm   You can do without it   Everywhere you go   Everything you do      Got to make the best   Just that bit better   You can step on out   You can do without      You don't have to be   Like every other   Don't dance to the rhythm   Do something 'bout it      Don't dance to the rhythm   You can do without it.God forbid you listen to me now..With you,   With you,   I wish we had another time,   I wish we had another place      Now Romeo and Juliet,   Bet they never felt the way we felt,   Bonnie and Clyde,   Never had to hide like,   We do,   We do      You and I both know it can't work,   It's all fun and games,   'Til someone gets hurt,   And I don't,   I won't let that be you      Now you don't wanna let go,   And I don't wanna let you know,   There might be something real between us two, who knew?"
"Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn’t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, ….In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says “hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese return”, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that “In the spring"" she will take the test again..I'll show it to ya!!!.[Chorus]   I'm gon' be manicured   You wanna be man cured   Ma ma ma manicured   She wanna be man cured   Salon's enough for her   Not to feel so insecure   Ma ma ma manicure   She wanna be take care'n of (man cured)   Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it   I'm addicted to the love that you garner (man cured)   Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it   Like a serial killer, man is a goner (man cured).Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you   (You know what Dre?.Used to go with my grandpa up to the town square   Set him down up there on a picnic bench   And he used to play checkers with them other old menup there   They used to tell stories bout when they were kids   Grandpa says he shot the Chief of Police when he was nine years old   I believe it   Cause they tell me Harlan Knetucky was the baddest place in the world   Why they say they used to sit out there on their front porch   Shoot them revenuers when they'd come down the hollow   Said they was so young took two of them boys   To hold the rifle and one to pull the trigger   Well grandpa he'd lie a little bit   But I'll tell you there's a lot of stories in Harlan County      Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord they knew that we were poor   They always called my daddy Preacher Dan   But daddy weren't no preacher least ways I don't recallect   Never hear of papa talk of nothin' but the land   Daddy was a God fearin' farmer yes he was   Could not read nor write Lord he could barely sign his name   Daddy was a God fearin' farmer all his life someday when I'm grown I'll be the same      Well he always grew tobacco though he did not smoke himself   He had the best tobacco crop around   And he never touched a drop of liquor that I can recall   Papa made his livin' on the ground   Yes Sunday go to meetin' called for more than he could stand   I guess he felt at home in his old clothes   But he never missed a Sunday takin' mama to the church   Maybe it was habit Lord but heaven only knows   Daddy was a God fearin' farmer...   [ steel - fiddle ]   Yeah folks in Harlan County Lord.....Save me!"
" The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It’s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus..I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run,   Tire tracks all across your back, uh-huh, I can see you had your fun..(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)   Easy to take it easy   That's what I'm looking for,   Baby let me know, ooh oh ooh oh   Ooh oh ooh oh oh   (Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)   Easy to take it easy   That's what I'm looking for,   Baby let me know, eh eh.And I will love you   'Til the day that I die..The boy from the chemist is here to see you..And the girls want to be with the girls,   And the girls want to be with the girls."
"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph..[Repeat: x3].Tell me something   I don't know?.Analyze!.Blind, oh no, my friend I am not blind   My eyes may be closed but I don't mind   For I see things far beyond your sight   'Cause God gave me a sense to guide me alright..Oh."
"The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again"", because the author wants to convey that. Saeng isn’t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say’s, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.”.Who gets to learn to dance   Before his race is run?.No mercy   No mercy   No mercy      In the midnight hush, the restless hours between dark and light   In dreams we come together underneath the cover of the night   You're holding out, but I'm holding on   Can't wait until your resistance is gone      No mercy, accept no defeat   No mercy, 'til you're here with me      Now the pressure's on   You can run away but you can't hide   You might as well surrender,   The walls are closing in on every side   I'm getting closer, now, there's no escape   Victory is written all over my face      No mercy, accept no defeat   No mercy, 'til you're here with me   No mercy, I won't give in no!.She must adore me !.The ice and the sun   And the thundering guns,   Good God I was finally sane..Oh, goodbye, goodbye you cruel town,   You've been a fair-weather friend,   Now I will go to some places that I know   Where things don't start just to end."
" The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner..Be prepared, be prepared,   Keep in mind the law..Oh, daddy..My veins are poppin from this love inside   I just can't let it out   This pipe and these needles are my only guide   They've got me on the wrong route      What is my life about   Living in the shadows of a man I've never seen   Dreamin' like a lonely child   I know your brothers and your sister and your mother too      Man I wish you could see them too   Oh Lord   Oh Lord   Man I wish that you could see them too   Man I wish that you could see them too      So can I come to see you sometime   'Cause I been missin you   I've never heard you cry I've never seen you whine   I'm feeling oh so young   But still I must die to get to you      And if I do I wonder how just you will see me   And implicate the things I've done   I'm dyin in the shadows of this man I've never seen   I'll see you soon   Now where's my gun      Oh Lord   Oh Lord   Oh Lord   Where's my gun   Oh where's my gun   Oh Lord   Where's my gun   Oh Lord   My gun      Let me open your eyes   Let me see who you are   I am you, you are me   We are a part of      The second coming of christ   It's God himself in a jar   Yeah... yeah   Yeah... yeah      Let me open your eyes   Let me see who you are   I am you, you are me   We are a part of      The second coming of christ   Its god himself in a jar   Yeah   Hey      You got me, sad and lonely   When I'm me...me   You know you make me so lonely   I am so alone      And I will pray and then I'll cry   And I will pray and then I'll cry   And I will pray and then I'll cry   And I will pray and then I'll cry.Relations, sparing no expense'll   Send some useless old utensil,   Or a matching pen and pencil..What could I do but run and run and run?"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn’t like it because I didn’t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story..Don't walk away   I need you more than words can say   I feel for you, this everlasting flame   My everlasting flame      I will wash away your tears   Through the pain and through the sorrow   Better days are still to come   If you would only turn around and      [Chorus]   Reach out and touch me   Reach out and hold me   Reach out and touch me!.I know the city gettin' ready for me   I know the city gettin' ready      I know the city gettin' ready for me   I know the city gettin' ready   End.(What did I say?).Too paid to freestyle..Yeah!"
" The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng’s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. ... ..I'm dreaming tonight   Of a place I love   Even more than I usually do   And although I know      It's a long road back   I promise you   I'll be home for Christmas   You can count on me      Please, have snow and mistletoe   And presents on the tree   Christmas Eve will find me   Where the lovelight gleams      I'll be home for Christmas   If only in my dreams      Christmas Eve will find me   Where the lovelight gleams   I'll be home for Christmas   If only in my dreams.I just want to see you smile and change your mind..But we're never gonna survive unless...   We get a little crazy..)(x2)   I'm telling you the truth,   Oh, girl, it's only you, whoa   You're my only(x3)   You're my only shorty      [Bridge]   Please, baby, please, give me   All your attention, say it   Don't let my heart go   Seeking no other direction   I've gotta be the only one for your affection,   Oh yeah, Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention      [Chorus]   You're my only shorty   (Am I your only shorty?)"
"She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant a live.She was disappointed in herself and so  that  why  she  said. In  the  spring, when  the  snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this hibiscus is budding, then  I  will take  that  tes t again. When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again..You're the one to blame      Oh well, goodbye, although I'm crying   Ain't that a shame?.But I hate you, I really hate you,   So much I think it must be      [Chorus]   True love, true love,   It must be true love..Just dance?.Jump!.Don't you know me better than that?"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again..There'll be no one to fight..Tell me it's for real and let me know   why does lovin' have to come and go..So now you tell me that you're leaving me for good   And all I wanna know is why?.Mother Mary feels so much pain   Looking at him      So..If you're gay, why aren't you waving a flag?"
"The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on..Water gray   Through the windows, up the stairs   Chilling rain   Like an ocean everywhere   Don't wanna reach for me, do you?.I and my go to a naughty party one day   Them said it' s gonna be irie there   But when I and my go to a naughty party   I and I was disappointed yeah   All we could hear there was their crackadoo   All we could hear there was their   Shoobee doobee yeah   And the music they played there   Was not good for a rasta man yeah   It was not good for a Jah man      Chorus: (x3)   I' m going back to my roots yeah yeah   Reggae music is all that I need      All we could hear there was their crackadoo   All we could hear there was their   Shoobee doobee yeah   And the music they played there   Was not good for a rasta man   It was not good for a Jah man      Chorus: (x2)   Reggae is mine reggae is mine yeah yeah   Reggae is mine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah   (fade)      Chorus till fade.Adolf Hitler: something in german...   George Burns: Hey fuckface, have you seen Gracie?.It's time to die a little..Oh darling, darling, is that the way you look?"
" I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese..If I play my role just right,   Tonight could be my lucky night   And you could be mine..Chorus   Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm   I'm coming through with the wickedness   Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this   Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm   I'm coming through with the wickedness   Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this   I got a nation of millions to capture   Lyrical disaster pass the ganja   Choppin' shit like a bladerunner   Huntin down my opponents like the predator   Ready to start my search like the hunt for red October 31st   Day of my birth had much pain as an adolescent   Natural stigmata, much drama when Mom's was stressin   They're on my trail like the bone collector   Select the sense from my sixth   Inject the fluid of the wickedness   Fuck the world!.Gun control, we don't want no   Gun control, we don't want no   Gun control, we don't want no   Gun control..Situation no-go zone   But she'll cut loose when she's alone      [Chorus:]   She's a love Blonde   She's a love Blonde   She's a love Blonde   She's got that sensuality for love      When the boys say ""how you been   What you doin', Can we get in ?"".Red comes from my Grandpa, he's an all American Brave."
" At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work..When they kick at your front door   How you gonna come?.But I'm, I'm a tad more interested (Ah ha ha look it,)   (She can't even walk in those shoes)   (I can walk better than that)   In flyin' your kite tonight (She can't even dance)   Cindy, is that alright?.Wise Man   I'm feelin' blue   Oh I'm not satisfied      He said you're not doin' too bad, not bad at all   You're just trying to walk son before you can crawl   You got stacks of money to sky up above   Now all you need is to find you a love      He sent me searchin' to find my love   He sent me searchin' to the Lord up above   He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove   And she'll tell you where to find your love   Oh Mr..Written by bob welch..Be the valentine, rip the heart of mine   Give your innocence to the brightest of dreams   This is harvest time, taste the bloodred wine   Of this gilded art, it is spilled from my own heart      It?s so hard to see my face   In the mirror?s cold disgrace   I wonder what is this I have become   A childish forlorn wish   So easy to seduce   Seems like it?s just one step to fall down      Be the valentine?"
" The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she’s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She’s said  and does lots of fun things..I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside..No equation   To explain the division of the senses   No sound to reflect   The radiance of time   In the beginningest dream   Halls of disorder   Where we are swept to encircle dawn   Strapped in a low car   Racing through silence   Trumpeting bliss   You could kiss the world   Goodbye   Standing outside the courthouse   In the rain   Seemed like a lost soul   From the chapel of dreams   With a handful of images   Faces of children   Phases of the moon   One little thing you get wrong   Changes the dimensions   Streets, swept memory   Diffused and lost   Like a prayer in the sun   Sometimes you can't tell   Whether you're waking up   Or going to sleep   Spiralling   Unnumbered streets   All the games cannot be yours   All the sights, the treasures of the eye   Does the divided soul remain the same?.Climb up geranium, it can't be fun subterran-ium   On the exterior, it's cheerier   Rsvp peonies, pollinate the breeze,   Make the queen of bees hot as brandy   Come give at least a preview of Easter   Come up and see the good we're giving   Come up and see the grounds for living   Come poke your head out,   Open up and spread out,   Hurry it's lovely here!.If we wanna, yes, we can, can   I know we can make it work, I know we can make it if we try   Yes, we can, I know we can can, yes we can make lot of money   Yes, we can, I know we can can      Yes, we can, I know we can can   Yes, we can can, why can't we?.Now, I'm standing here,   Strange, strange voices in my ears,   I feel the tears,   But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,   Just spoken to help nobody but you,   Words with lies inside,   But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh."
"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” Now tell that wasn’t beautiful..This must be heaven, tonight I cross the line   You must be the angel, I though I might never find   Was it you I heard singing, oh, while I was chasin' dreams   Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around   And the rain fallin' down but I never know   Got to be heaven 'cause here's where the rainbow ends   If this ain't the real thing, then it's close enough to pretend   When that wind blows when the night's about to fall   You can hear the silence call, it's a certain sort of sound   Like the rain fallin' down   Hole's in what's left of my reason, hole's in the knees of my blues   Odds against me been increasin' but I'll pull through   I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do   But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine   I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose   Never know now, just don't never know, no   Well it's been heaven but even the rainbows will end   Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'   And I'm as good as gone again   I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance   Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance   And the rain fallin' down, well, you never know, just don't know   Listen, sure don't know what I going for, but I'm gonna go for it for sure.I thought you were done..I'm shittin' on the hood..[Verse 2]   And people like to laugh at you cause they   Are all the same..We take a walk, the sun is shining down,   Burns my feet as they touch the ground."
" The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well..Though I never, I never   Stole another man's wife   But, I fooled around plenty enough   And I got what I paid for..You opened my eyes   To a whole new world for me..It's dark in the day, now say, now don't complain   Look up the sun it's just a call away   You so afraid to cry, but your heart be feeling dry   It's time to change   But you keep thundering thundering   I'm wondering wondering why it keep thundering   Won't you just pray, and get it over with      Tonight feel the pain, now baby I won't complain   I hate saying look up the sun it's just a call away   And I was so afraid to cry   And when you need a way to ride, that's the way   Keep thundering thundering   I'm wondering wondering why it keep thundering   Want to just fucking rage and get it over with   And get it over with   I see you rolling it   Let's get it over with   Get high and float again   Roll up and go again   I see you rolling it   Let's get it over with   Get high and float again   Roll up and go again      It's alright we can roll in the clouds   Getting high we can float in the clouds   It's alright we can roll in the clouds   Getting high we can float in the clouds   It's alright we can roll in the clouds   Getting high we can float in the clouds   It's alright we can roll in the clouds   Getting high we can float in the clouds      Keep thundering thundering   I'm wondering wondering why it keep thundering   Want to just fucking rage and get it over with   And get it over with   And get it over with      It's alright we can roll in the clouds   Getting high we can float in the clouds   It's alright we can roll in the clouds   Getting high we can float in the clouds   It's alright we can roll in the clouds   Getting high we can float in the clouds      We should be lightning up   We should be lightning up   Start it with a lightning      It's dark in the day, now say, now don't complain   Look up the sun it's just a call away.Shc opened the door and she let me in   And divil the one did hear us..Drink a toast, down the cup   Drink to bones that turn to dust      Cause   No one, no one, no one...

" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring..Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime..I wanna know!.Religion..When the road is full of nails,   Garbage pails and darkened jails   And their tongues are full of heartless tales   That drain on you   Who would ever notice you   You fade into a shaded room ?.She sits by the window with wandering eyes   She has a song in her heart   And a golden disguise   Her body is torn because age doesn't heal   She's not letting on   About the pain that she feels   But she knows in her soul   That it won't be too long   'Til Jesus comes back   To carry her home...      [Chorus]   Where there will be no more pain   No more sorrow   No more waiting   For illusive tomorrows   There will be no more pain   No more dying   No more striving or strain   No more pain      My mind's eye remembers the trouble I've seen   All I have been through,   And how I long to be free   But I learn by her patience that I need her resolve   To wait for the opening of eternity's halls   And I know that in time we will stand side by side   When Jesus comes back receiving his bride      [Chorus 3X]      No more pain"
" I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says “in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again”.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time..Though I'm tryin' and tryin' to find my baby,   Won't someone please send her home to me..Called out to prove my love   You reply by getting defensive   Called out o prove my love   Now you should be able to sense it      I'm full of your dreams   I let you sleep with the lights on   Stay with me might as well   Be the kind of girl you want to beI am in love      I am in love   I am a fool   Fell from above   These things that I have done      They would be a test of anyone   How am I meant to see   You dressed up like your mother   They say you marry your father      I hope that don't reflect on me   They say you marry your mother   I hope that don't put you in her company   I am in love      I am in love   And I am a fool   There is no other   I am in love      I am in love   What I say is don't lie   But it's enough to make you wonder   I can't be one that you want to trust      And not the one that you want to trample   In the dust   I am in love   I am in love      And I am a fool   There is no other   I am in love   I am in love      Into the fire   Tears start coming   Good stars surround us   It's enough to want to make you wonder.Yeah, I know that I let you down,   Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?.Our guilt, our blame,   I've been far too sympathetic..Good morning girl, how you been?"
" The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she she figurers when all the snow is melted she”ll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn’t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    .Bye-bye!"".If there's a heaven where good music goes,   I know it will be there..I'm looking deep in your eyes, babe,   And all I can see is myself..Let's go!.Why we should be on dead end street."
" The author concluded the story in the paragraph. She doesn’t want Saeng vows the whole room to herself where it’s quite when she is taking the test..Let me go easy..Black clouds on the horizon   Great thunder and burning rain   His chariot pounding   I heard the heavens scream his name      I watched as he shouted   To the giants who died that day   He held up his hammer high   And called to Odin for a sign      Thor the mighty Thor the brave   Crush the infidels in your way   By your hammer let none be saved   Live to die on that final day   Gods monsters and men   Will die together in the end      God of thunder god of rain   Earth shaker who feels no pain   The powerhead of the universe   Now send your never ending curse      I watched as he shouted   To the giants who died that day   He held up his hammer high   And called to Odin for a sign      Thor the mighty Thor the brave   Crush the infidels in your way   By your hammer let none be saved   Live to die on that final day   Gods monsters and men   Will die together in the end      Swing your hammer to crack the sky   Lift your cape so that you might fly   Back to Odin and the gods on high   And leave the mortal world      Thor the mighty Thor the brave   Crush the infidels in your way   By your hammer let none be saved   Live to die on that final day   Gods monsters and men   Will die together in the end      Odin.If you're looking for Heaven's only door,   You've got the key baby open me..Come and take it from me, hurry,   Got to let it go..I'm everything you can't control   Somewhere beyond the pain   There must be a way to believe we can break through      Do what you, what you want   You don't have to lay your life down (Is it over?)"
"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It’s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is..Yield, summer's brightest sunrise,   To this December morn:   Life up your gates, ye Princes   And let the Child be born!.I've been living my life in a cage   Freedom spits in my face   It was such a disgrace   And I was lonely   And feeling empty   Desperate      I had my head in a noose   I had nothing to loose   Had enough of abuse   And now I'm dangerous   Hateful, contagious   It haunts us      I'm angry (I'm angry)   I'm raging (I'm raging)   I'm breaking through the pain      [Chorus]   The monster's loose   And now you know the truth   Tell me can you feel it   As you hit the wall   The monsters loose   And now you have to choose   And prove you can take it   To the top before you fall      I've walked a slippery road   Felt a twitch in my soul   Through the wind and the cold   With no protection   Just one direction   Destruction      I've paid for all my mistakes   Taking all I can take   Until I'm ready to break   I'm feeling vicious   And so outrageous   It breaks us      I'm leaving   Still breathing   I'm tearing through these chains      [Chorus]      I've lived a thousand years in darkness   Banished all alone   Inside my mind with just my madness   Behind these walls of stone      I was falling apart at the seams   Holding my breath just to breathe   I tasted the sting of my tears      I was waking up stuck in a dream   Ran out of air, couldn't screamed   Wasted away by my fears      The monster's loose   And now you know the truth   Tell me can you feel it   As you hit the wall      The monster's loose   And now you have to choose   And prove that you can take it   To the top and never fall      The monster's loose   You've lost your last excuse   Now show me that you got it   Even when you fall      The monster's loose   This game is win or loose   Sometimes you gotta' do it   And show the world you want it all.Someone said as we shook hands   She was just Miss Jones to me   And then I said ""Miss Jones,      You're a girl who understands,   I'm a man who must be free."".I could be singing to the sea..Last night I had the strangest dream   I ever dreamed before   I dreamed the world had all agreed   To put an end to war   I dreamed I saw a mighty room   The room was filled with men   And the paper they were signing said   They'd never fight again      And when the papers all were signed   And a million copies made   They all joined hands end bowed their heads   And grateful prayers were prayed   And the people in the streets below   Were dancing round and round   And guns and swords and uniforms   Were scattered on the ground      Last night I had the strangest dream   I ever dreamed before   I dreamed the world had all agreed   To put an end to war"
" I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back..Brr, do, do, da, do, do   Brr, do, do, da, do, do, oo   Brr-ooo, brr, ooo, brr-ooo   Da, oo, da, oo, da, oo, da, oo, brr-ooo      Goodbye my love, happy life, my love   I'm tired and I just can't take no more   Tired of being tough 'cause enough is enough   This time I'm really headed for the door      You better believe, I'm gonna let my heart do the walking   Walk me into something good   (So good, so good)   I'm gonna let my heart do the walking   (Do the walking)   Oh, it ain't no make believing, my heart's set on leaving      You take my very best and give me less   I'm tired and I just can't take no more   Your love is unstable and darling I'm unable   Gonna ease on out the door      You better believe, I'm gonna let my heart do the walking   Walk me into something good   (So good, so good)   I'm gonna let my heart do the walking   (Do the walking)   Oh, I never thought I could but I'm leaving for good      Gonna let it do the walking, baby   (Do the walking)   I'm gonna let it do the walking baby   (Do the walking)      Oh, oh, oh      Walk on heart, walk on, walk on heart, tip on out the door   Walk on heart, walk on, walk on heart, tip on out the door   Walk on heart, walk on, walk on heart, walk on out the door   With your bad self      I'm gonna let my heart do the walking   Walk me into something good   (So good, so good)   I'm gonna let my heart do the walking   (Do the walking)   I never thought I could but I'm leaving for good      I'm gonna let it do the walking, baby   (Do the walking)   Walk me into something good   (So good, so good)      Let my heart do the walking.Now that you've patronised us, humiliated us,   Please go away..Suppose the taxman, he comes to town,   And you don't lay your money down..Now you're the one who's cryin' way inside   Oh, I know what it's like   It's happened many times to me   Oh, do you ache inside   Do your eyes want a cry?.When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning."
" I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on.Blue spruce clinin' to the grade in the evening   They take the chill away fine..Lordy   La, la, la, la, la (Sucker)   Got to drive   [Repeat: 3X]   (It's just a dream)   Look out      Do you want to party?.I take federal chances I work so hard for the bread..Well some people in bound infatuation   While some others spell depression as the law   Someone's mother getting no imagination   So beware then, baby, sin is at everyone's door..Please be easy you got it I haven't,   Somewhere in your ""harmineenou, home-arneenou""   There's a room in a long form   Where you just play a tune   It gets us really stoned,   Really amazingly,   Cussi, Cussi, Cussi,   Cussi, Cussi, Cussi."
" The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now..Cathedral..I'm searching for you   I wanna know, where did you go?.Does she purr?.After all the songs I sang you,   There's no doubt in my mind..I won't ever, no I'll never get to hold her."
" The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season..Now   Fuck everything, everything, everything   How could you love someone with what they've done?.Go on!.Every night you're out there darlin'..My baby is gone, you might have a chance..Oh, moon of Alabama   We now must say good-bye   We've lost our good old momma   And must have boys, oh you know why!"
" Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them..In the name of love lost   I'm frozen to her and I want you   To come build me a bridge soaked   In gasoline and pass the torch      Hey baby let me be your Valentine   Saint Valentine   Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep a lie alive   Like Saint Valentine      Like the couple from Pompeii   Our drama is put on display   Along with a dove stuffed in a coffin of glass   Entitled ""Love lust and the holy ghost""      Those were the days      Hey, baby, let me be your valentine   St. Valentine   Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive      Hey, baby, let me be your valentine   St. Valentine   Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive   Like St. Valentine      Love is the only war worth dying for   Lift me up to knock me down I'm all yours for now      Hey, baby, let me be your valentine   St. Valentine   Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive      Hey, baby, let me be your valentine   St. Valentine   Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive   Like St. Valentine      Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine   Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine   Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine   Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine   Like St. Valentine.I'm going down, down,   Take you down to paradise..I know why you want love in the middle of the night   Don't be looking out scary   When you've been looking for this for long long time   Come on over here baby you can love me in the dark,   You can love me in the light   ....What's practical is logical..You do this, and I oblige   And I fight."
"In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel..We keep on   Keep on   Keep on   Keep cool      Keep calm   Keep real   Hey never you let them get you down   You might never come around   Never you let them out your fire   You won't get your heart desire      Never you let them out your fire   Say keep cool   Keep calm   Keep real   Real warm   Keep pure   Keep strong and keep on together now      [Repeat: x2]   The sweat a man brow   Man eat you bread      Dread      Keep on   Keep on   Keep cool   Keep calm   Keep pure   Keep strong   Keep on   Hey don't you dare fear that whindy narrow   Your today spells your tomorrow   Don't you fear that windy narrow   Your today spells your tomorrow   Don't you fear that windy narrow      Say keep cool   Keep Calm   Keep pure   Keep strong   Keep right   Not wrong   Yea   Keep   Together now   Never you let them get you down   For you might never come around   Never you let them out your fire   For you won't get your heart desire   Never you let them out your fire   Iya   Say keep on   Keep on   Keep on   Keep on   Keep on   Keep on   Keep on   Don't you dare let them get you down   For you might never come around   Never you let them out your fire   For you won't get your heart desire   Never you let them out your fire Rasta      Keep keep keep   Keep on   Say we got to keep   Keep on   Keep you sense of direction   Keep on.All my love, all my way   I believe that I belong, by your side for right or wrong.You don't know just what I've gone through, that's why I would rather show   You   Just how far that I can take it, every rule, I'm breaking it.You!.The almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame   Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang   (oh, you tell them Alan)."
" The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blosomed the leaves had come out and then the pollin had found the right kind of trees . At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again..I love you, I love you, I love you, earth..And nigger, guess!.How can you stand there and deny it?.Whoa here we go now baby!.Did you wait for something that never came?"
" I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.The author could of wanted to show more details in the story..Angels watching over me, every step I take,   Angels watching over me!.Juliet's trying to find out what she wants,   But she don't know   Experience has got her down   Look this direction, I know it's not perfection,   It's just me   I want to bring you up again now!.But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time   And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home..Chorus.You woke me up from this long and empty sleep."
"I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS. THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY..Goodbye baby, hello friend,   It's good to see you again..Spare a thought for the souls   Who cannot leave this earth   The attachments bind so tightly, not a chance   Not a chance of a new birth   The river gently beckons   But the answer is no   Gripping their illusions   They cannot let them go   Hunger for the flesh   Leads them to a weaker heart   Mortals who imprisoned themselves   Let them have a new start   Wishing to hold onto life and all it's games   Singing their lament song   Holding back the change   They came here for to dance   To learn and not to cling   Holding onto life   As if it were the important thing   Hunger for the flesh   Hunger for security   Caught up in the mesh   Caught up for eternity   Hunger for the flesh   Hunger for security   Caught up in the mesh   Caught up for eternity   The river gently beckons   But the answer is no   Gripping their illusions   They cannot let them go   Hunger for the flesh   Leads them to a weaker heart   Mortals who imprison themselves   Let them have a new start   Let them have a new start   Hunger for the flesh   Hunger for security   Caught up in the mesh   Caught up for eternity   Hunger for the flesh   Hunger for security   Caught up in the mesh   Holding back the change.I'm your man, child..There's a friend who will call   When her husband's asleep   Crossing the phone lines for comfort   And she cries that she needs him and      Someday he'll change   And now's not a good time to go   And it isn't my place to say leave him and run   That no love is worth all the damage he's done      But if she'll hold her ground   Then I'll hold my tongue,ever the diplomat   Oh, I'd like to think   That I would be stronger than that      Where's her head?.New Orleans is sinking man, and I don't wanna swim      Colonel Tom, what's wrong?"
" The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again. .No one seems to know you quite like I do,   No one knows the thigs that make you cry..Just an echo?.That song is sung out..You win again, you gypsy heart   I count the days that we're apart   I sleep alone when you're away   No sense in saying I wish you'd stay   It's all the same, you never change   You come and go just like the rain   I pray each day that you are gone   This time it won't be so long   Your gypsy heart will never find   Any arms as warm as mine   And gypsy, when we meet again   I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms   Oh, you gypsy heart   Your gypsy heart can always call   When your back's against the wall   And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start   You never left me on my own   Oh, you gypsy heart   I pray each day that you are gone   This time, oh, it won't be so long   Your gypsy heart will never find   Any arms as warm as mine   And gypsy, when we meet again   I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms   Oh, you gypsy heart   Your gypsy heart can always call   When your back's against the wall   And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start   You never left me on my own   Oh, you gypsy heart   Your gypsy heart will never find   Any arms as warm as mine   And gypsy, when we meet again   I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms   Oh, you gypsy heart   Your gypsy heart can always call   When your back's against the wall   And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start   You never left me on my own   Oh, you gypsy heart.Lulu always wants to do, what we boys don't want her to,   When she struts her stuff around, London bridge is falling down,   You can bring cake or Porterhouse steak, but don't bring Lulu."
"The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says “In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.”.I'm sorry honey that you walked in and caught her in my lap   But it's not what you're thinking so think before you slap   I suppose you're weighin' that little blonde that walked here in this bar   Ah don't tell me you're sory cause I know how sorry you are   I'm sorry that you think I'm drunk I ain't had a drink today   Would you believe I held her just to see how much she'd weight   That cheatin' look that's on your face is lit up like a star   So don't tell me you're sorry cause I know how sorry you are   Don't tell me you're sorry but I'm as sorry as I can be   Well you'd better move fast and don't give me no sass cause you belong to me   Now honey we ain't done nothing wrong but I'm sorry it's gone this far   But don't tell me you're sorry cause I know how sorry you are   [ guitar ]   Don't tell me you're sorry...   Now wait a minute Loretta you know how sorry I am   Conway you better believe I know how sorry you are.Lets switch and let me do you instead   Though I love the way you give it to me   Girl, we'll be bouncing like the springs on the bed   You gone love it when I give you some (ha ha ha ha ha)   Switch and let you do me instead   Cuz I love it when you give it to me.Christians, awake, salute the happy morn   Whereon the Saviour of the world was born   Rise to adore the mystery of love   Which hosts of angels chanted from above   With them the joyful tidings first begun   Of God incarnate and the Virgin's Son      Then to the watchful shepherds it was told   Who heard the angelic herald's voice: ""Behold,   I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth   To you and all the nations upon earth   This day hath God fulfilled His promised word.Or Jupiter in Juno?.Oh, so very close!"
" The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job..By then all my best days were past..There was a farmer had a dog,   And Bingo was his name-o..He wrote Romeo and Juliet   But his greatest story yet   Is coming back as someone's pet   And gettin' neutered by the vet   He got his paws caught in a net   Then he said to be or not to meeeow!.I'm happy when life's good   And when it's bad I cry   I've got values but I don't know how or why      I'm looking for me   You're looking for you   We're looking in at other   And we don't know what to do      [Chorus].Condemnation   Tried   Here on the stand   With the book in my hand   And truth on my side   Accusations   Lies   Hand me my sentence   I'll show no repentance   I'll suffer with pride   If for honesty   You want apologies   I don't sympathize   If for kindness   You substitute blindness   Please open your eyes   Condemnation   Why   Because my duty   Was always to beauty   And that was my crime   Feel elation   High   To know I can trust this   Fix of injustice   Time after time   If you see purity   As immaturity   Well it's no surprise   If for kindness   You substitute blindness   Please open your eyes"
"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is about this girl named Saeng and her mother and grandmother. Flowers are beauitful to them they plant them all day. Picking them, @CAPS1 them. “Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye”    .[Chorus]   The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,   The answer is blowin' in the wind..Mama   Please throw me out in the cold   Woman   The love you bought was never sold      [Chorus]      Mama   I don't love you anymore   Sorry   I'm not the boy you're looking for      (See the girl with they eyes on fire   Now he know she's the one he desires).Not only that remember my great idea that Mike had last week?.All brawn and no brains   And all those nice things   And you finally got what you want   Someone to look good with   And light your cigarette   Is this what you really want?.I said something wrong,   Now I long for yesterday."
"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things.Ba da da da pffftt.Brighter than a diamond ring (how great?).The sky looks pissed   The wind talks back   My bones are shifting in my skin   And you my love are gone      My room seems wrong   The bed won't fit   I cannot seem to operate   And you my love are gone      So glide away on soapy heels   And promise not to promise anymore   And if you come around again   Then I will take, then I will take the chain from off the door      I'll never say I'll never love   But I don't say a lot of things   And you my love are gone      So glide away on soapy heels   And promise not to promise anymore   And if you come around again   Then I will take, then I will take the chain from off the door.You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway   Hey, just whose life is this anyway?.Did you find another house in the sun?"
" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character doesn’t like this test. And would rather not take it.Oh how much I need you..Lonely together   When I'm alone with you      Now that we've come so far   It seems like the end   We could be lovers   We could never be friends      I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends      We can never talk   Like others seem to do   Lonely together   Making love to you      We don't get nothing   From the letters we send   We could be lovers   We could never be friends      I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends      Plus a new relationship   You know you break my heart   What I feel for you's too strong   It has been from the start   Every time I see your face   It's tearing me apart   What is need is love from you   Oh, but I can't?.Their faces keep changing   Just like these feelings I have for you   And nothing's forever not even five minutes   When you're headed for the finish line      Down in the depot out by the meat rack   Down by the tunnels surrounding the jail   Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles   They're heading for the finish line      They're lining up for Noah's Ark   They're stabbing each other in the dark   Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks   Heading for the finish line      Close to the line the ice is cracking   Two rented feelings sitting in the stands   Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for   All of a sudden it comes back to me      Just up ahead is the finish line   Two rented referees and two checkered rags   Out of the corner of my eye comes a   Dark horse with black wings   Headed for the finish line      I'm five years old the room is fuzzy   I think there's also a very young girl   It's hard to remember what happened exactly   As I'm staring at the finish line   First came fire then came light   Then came feeling then cane sight.I got to find myself..James Dean, James Dean, so hungry and so lean."
" The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring..Somebody tell me,   (It doesn't make any sense at all)   Somebody tell me,   Why we're living in a world of contradiction..These are strange times   And I don't want to live this way.I was looking at the Big Sky..No, no, Mama, Tryin' Devil done do-si-do   Two young boys lyin' dead by the side of the road      (Louisiana bayou) Down by the bayou   Tryin' to play with the 'caine   Tryin' to get with the pain   See there's nowhere to go      Louisiana bayou   Tryin' to play with the 'caine   Tryin' to play with the 'caine   Troubles do it again      Same old sold story again (Louisiana bayou)   Tryin' to play with the 'caine   Tryin' to play with the 'caine   Same old story again      (Louisiana bayou) Down by the bayou   Tryin' to play with the 'caine   Tryin' to play with the 'caine   Same old story again      (Louisiana bayou) Down by the bayou   Tryin' to play with the 'caine      Oh it's a shame to lose your way running wild (same old story again)   Oh it's a shame to lose the light that shines   Oh it's a shame to lose your way as a child   Oh (same old story again) it's a shame to lose your   Down by the bayou      Louisiana bayou      Louisiana bayou.Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,   Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,   Cry, cry, cry, cry."

" It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else..In pain we succeed..They talking ATL, Atlanta Georgia,   We the shit,   We talking Holy Feild you know that nigga named Michael Vick   They called me mamma boy but now they call me drummer boy,   They talking jet skiis, I had that shit last summer boy,   Charles is gone, Cher is show case,   5 5 9 night life (they had it goin on),   Back then Shawty D was gone,   Flat heat right here was on,   They put me on the song back then we all got along, ain't had no switch game   Atlanta just won't be the same,   Hit Man, Sammy Sam, DJ Smurf and Ying Yang,   I know when kids rockin(?).The reason I don't barbeque on 'em on Wednesday, because he fucking, fucking falls in the grill..I don't want to turn nobody on,   Unless it's you..You got a new jive."

"I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn’t melt in the spring geese don’t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    .I fear that the music will end,   And shatter the spell it may lend..Red wine, Konvict, Gaga (oh, yeah)      I've had a little bit too much - much oh oh woah!.It couldn't be the ratings,   You had the best in town..Refrain:   O praise Him!.It ain't over, it ain't over yet."
"The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story..Hey, now everything is so secure   And everybody else is satisfied..Let a killer fuck you..Go home, pretender   I think this is the end here   It's been a long time decidin'   But I think I've found the right end..It's a junkie slip!.I hear the train a comin'   It's rolling round the bend   And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,   I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on   But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Anton..."
"The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it’s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng “cheep skip over live to you’re back she saw cheerfully” @CAPS1 it’s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to.And will be there to meet you when its your time..Erase the race that claim the place   And say we dig for ore.   ""See the light ram through the gaps in the land."".I think the best is yet to come cause   Where I'm from is also where I'm going..Surabaya Johnny,   My God and I still love you so..Oh, feels like you light me up   Feels like you light me up   When the sparks run out      Sometimes the love that you wasted   Becomes the love that you've lost   A moment feels like a life time   Cry cry cry, you can't stop   Just when I feel no ignition   No one but me understands   Arms reach out from a distance   Palm to palm, touch your hands      Oh, feels like you light me up   Feels like you light me up   When the sparks run out   Oh, feels like you light me up   Feels like you light me up   When the sparks run out      You know that you are a fighter   But you feel yourself fall apart   Now you're just panicing because you're left defeated   And you see nothing but dark   But when my soul is in pieces   No one but me understands   Arms reach out from a distance   Palm to palm, touch your hands      Oh, feels like you light me up   Feels like you light me up   When the sparks run out   Oh, feels like you light me up   Feels like you light me up   When the sparks run out      Oh, feels like you light me up   Feels like you light me up   When the sparks run out   Oh, feels like you light me up   Feels like you light me up   When the sparks run out"
" The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around..High rise, veins of the avenue   Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue   Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you      Street lights glisten on the boulevard   And cold nights make staying alert so hard   For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard   Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay   Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?.A diamond on every finger, he wore he wore a tailor made suit,   Black cigar, he wore a Stetson hat,   He wore a pair on cowboy boots,   Busted on through the door mad as he could be,   Don't mess around, I'll cut you down 'cause my name is Big Boy Pete..It will heal you and steal you   And take you away   Like a note in a bottle   With nothing to say      Now back when this earth   Was a silver blue jewel   And back when your grandfather's   Father was young,   Men of these shores   Made and gave up their lives   Pulling up fish from the sea..With God as our Father,   Brothers all are we,   Let me walk with my brother,   In perfect harmony..Have you heard the news?"
"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.” @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant..By a lonely prison wall   I heard a young girl calling,   'michael, they are taking you away..Christmas in the Caribbean   Snowbirds fill the air   Christmas in the Caribbean   Lots of presents everywhere   We don't live in a hurry   Send away for mistletoe   Christmas in the Caribbean   We got everything but snow..She went to Germany..Are you feelin' me?.So you betta send a letta to the better."
"There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it’s the end of the story so it’s a good way to end it because it’s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it’s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It’s not like most endings to a story so it’s unique. Because most stories aren’t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph..[Chorus]   There's the Reptile (Reptile)   Just see his eyes   Reptile (Reptile)   Can you see the beast arise      [Chorus]   Reptile (Reptile)   Creeping up on you   Reptile (Reptile)   There's nothing left that you can do      [Chorus]   And there's the Reptile (Reptile)   Hidden till now   Reptile (Reptile)   But now it's there you don't know how      [Chorus]   Reptile (Reptile)   Just watch it grow   Reptile (Reptile)   And there's no more human being left but you      Oerrrps !.So,   Chorus   Carry me through the hard part..I saw you walking   Only yesterday   When I ran to catch you   You disappeared   And the street was gray      The candle died   Now you are gone   For the flame was too bright   Now you are gone      I heard you laughing   With your laugh of gold   When I called out to you   Silence returned   And the air was cold      The castle fell   Now you are gone      No more rings the bell   Now you are gone   I found a letter   On the day it rained   When I tore it open   There in my hands   Only ash remained      The castle fell   Now you are gone   No more rings the bell   Now you are gone      I felt you breathing   As I fell asleep   When I reached out to touch you   No one was there   And the night was deep      The candle died   Now you are gone   For the flame was too bright   Now you are gone      I saw you walking   Only yesterday   When I ran to catch you   You disappeared   And the street was gray      The castle fell   Now you are gone   No more rings the bell   Now you are gone.Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.Notice me   Take my hand   Why are we   Strangers when   Our love is strong   Why carry on without me?"
" The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year..Of course he now denies it   You'd expect that of a con   But he couldn't run forever,   No, not even Jean Valjean!.What you thinkin' of?.Now the people sure get picky when it comes to givin' a ride   It didn't take long us leavin' but I thought we'd never arrive   Now we get more rides than hitches as we hitch hiked along   I got sore feet and blisters and Billy Ray wrote a song..I got up at 9:30 in the morning,   Which I want you to know is an effort on my part..Well General Taylor gained the day   Walk him along, John, Carry him along   Well General Taylor he gained the day   Carry him to his bury'n ground      [Chorus]   Tell me where you're stormy   Walk him along, John, carry him along   Tell me where you're stormy   Carry him to his bury'n ground      We'll dig his grave with a silver spade   Walk him along, John, Carry him along   His shroud of the finest silk will be made   Carry him to his bury'n ground      [Chorus]      We'll lower him down on a golden chain   Walk him along, John, Carry him along   On every inch we'll carve his name   Carry him to his bury'n ground      [Chorus]      General Taylor he's all the go   Walk him along, John, Carry him along   He's gone where the stormy winds won't blow   Carry him to his bury'n ground      [Chorus]      General Taylor he's dead and he's gone   Walk him along, John, Carry him along   Well General Taylor he's long dead and gone   Carry him to his bury'n ground      [Chorus:Repeat x2]"
" The authoR ends the STORY this way because their trying To show that Saeng will be dedicated To the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test.

"The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste.

"I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring the would have to start all over in growing this plant..Sometimes I wake up, reaching for him..There's no denying that   Oh, Attawapiskat   You're on your way      And though there's no sign   Of a songbird up here yet   No one to take advantage of   We know that life is short   Nobody can afford it   To sing a song that they don't love   I've come too far to feel like this   You've come too far to feel like that      Attawapiskat   City by the Bay!.Lookin' at the pictures of the places   That he'd been, an old man told me what he'd found   Said it don't make no difference whether you're   Out or whether you're in, though the world keeps   Goin' round and round..Gramma said that somewhere out there there's a good man, waiting for me      Gramma said she'll leave the lights on for me   Gramma said the flags are waving for me   Gramma said that somewhere out there there's a good man, waiting for me   Gramma said she'll leave the lights on for me   Gramma said the flags are waving for me   Gramma said that somewhere out there there's a good man, waiting for me.But all our friends know we're just a little old fashioned   She and I      Oh ain't that great   Aint it fine   To have a love someone that others can't find   Aint it wonderful to know all we ever need is just the two of us   She and I   So wonderful   She and I      She and I share with every body else   The same wants, needs and desires   She and I save   She and I pay on everything we acquire      Ah but just because we aren't often seen separately   People think we live one life."

"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said; “when they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again..Yes and amen, we?re taking up our cross for You,   Give us the strength to take these dreams and follow through..Even though you will betray me   The very minute that I leave..Help me, help me, help me, help me      Is this love?.These scars on my...oh wait I'm reading the wrong song   And behind my...   Chocolate Rain!.Boom!"
" The author concludes the story with this Paragraph because so you can get a view of what she is saying and also so you can understand it from her situration she was growing up like for example she said that.This ain't what forever's for,   And I ain't gonna take it,      I ain't gonna take it anymore..Oh laudate dominum!.I'm waiting for the night to fall   I know that it will save us all   When everything's dark   Keeps us from the stark reality   I'm waiting for the night to fall   When everything is bearable   And there in the still   All that you feel is tranquillity   There is a star in the sky   Guiding my way with its light   And in the glow of the moon   Know my deliverance will come soon   I'm waiting for the night to fall   I know that it will save us all   When everything's dark   Keeps us from the stark reality   I'm waiting for the night to fall   When everything is bearable   And there in the still   All that you feel is tranquillity   There is a sound in the calm   Someone is coming to harm   I press my hands to my ears   It's easier here just to forget fear   And when I squinted   The world seemed rose-tinted   And angels appeared to descend   To my surprise   With half-closed eyes   Things looked even better   Than when they were open   Been waiting for the night to fall   I knew that it would save us all   Now everything's dark   Keeps us from the stark reality   Been waiting for the night to fall   Now everything is bearable   And here in the still   All that you feel is tranquility.There's a little hope for you and i.Zion's daughter, now your heart is full of joy   In a cradle in the manger lies the Holy Boy      Zion's daughter, with your sweet angelic smile   Holding in your arms the Christ Child, resting for awhile      Now the world is waiting, People want to hear   What in Bethlehem had happened, that have brought the Savior near   Now high hope starts rising for another day   With eternal love and justice finally on the way      Zion's daughter, now your heart is full of joy   In a cradle in the manger lies the Holy Boy      Zion's daughter, with your sweet angelic smile   Holding in your arms the Christ Child, resting for awhile      Zion's daughter, now your heart is full of joy   In a cradle in the manger lies the Holy Boy      Zion's daughter, with your sweet angelic smile   Holding in your arms the Christ Child, resting for awhile      That's the way it happened many years ago,   With the sky above the shining in a wondrous glow      Now the world is waiting, people want to hear   What in Bethlehem had happened, that all will say you're near      Zion's daughter, now your heart is full of joy   In a cradle in the manger lies the Holy Boy      Zion's daughter, with your sweet angelic smile   Holding in your arms the Christ Child, resting for awhile      Zion's daughter"
" What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants. .What would it take to push a man,   Far enough to put somethin material over a human life?.It was too hot to thing us sweeping, tossing and turning   Waiting for a girl like you feeling lonely   I am lost in the sea of love, It's only you that I am   Thinking how   I don't know what I would do if I had to live my life   Without you      Oh I wish it was a magic night, So we can dance to the   Morning light   Moving together body and soul, Body and soul under the   Stars   Oh I wish this was a magic night, So we can dance into   The morning light   Moving together body and soul, body and soul      What wonderful moments we had, moments of passion   Never thought I'd ever be live so lonely   I am lost in the sea of love, It's only you that I am   Thinking how   I don't know what I would do if I have to live my life   Without you      Oh I wish it was a magic night, So we can dance to the   Morning light   Moving together body and soul, Body and soul under the   Stars   Oh I wish this was a magic night, So we can dance into   The morning light   Moving together body and soul, body and soul.Ooooh, bless you child, bless you child..Make that change!).Come on turn it up, madness   Stalking the night, feeding fast on my prey   Draining the life till the dawn of the day   Drinking and sucking, the blood rushing sweet   Half crazed with glory, half crazed in the heat   Blood lust   Tearing the flesh of the weak and the child   Sparing no one, the meek and the mild   I sink my fangs in your neck as you dream   I am Count Cronos, vampire supreme   Blood lust   Blood lust upon me, I'm biting the flesh   I'll take away your God given breath   Now, I shall feast on your life giving blood   Leave you to die on the land you once stood   Blood lust"
" The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight you’ll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people..Jesus loves the little children..I got my dress from a railroad man   And my shoes from a driver deep in the mine..In cuttin' and haulin' in frost and in snow   We're up against troubles that few people know   It's only by courage and patience and grit   And eatin' plain food that we keep ourselves fit   The hard and the easy we take as they come   And when ponds freeze over we shorten our runs   To hurry my haulin' with spring coming on   I near lost me a mare out on Tickle Cove Pond      Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White   Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might   Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can   And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond      I knew that the ice grew weaker each day   But still took the risk and kept haulin' away   One evening in April, bound home with a load   My mare showed some halting against the ice road   She knew more than I did as matters turned out   Been lucky for me had I joined her in doubt   She turned round her head with tears in her eyes   As if she was sayin', you're risking our lives      All this I ignored with a whip-handle blow   For man is a stupid dumb creature you know   And the very next moment the pond gave a sigh   And up to our necks went poor Kitty and I      Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White   Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might   Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can   And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond      And if I had taken wise Kitty's advice   I ne'er would have made that shortcut on the ice   Poor creature she's dead, poor creature she's gone   I'll ne'er get my mare out of Tickle Cove Pond      I raised an alarm you could hear for a mile   And neighbors showed up in a very short while   You can always rely on the Oldfords and Whites   To render assistance in all your bad plights   To help a kind neighbor is part of their lives   The same can be said for their children and wives   And with the rope fastened around the mare's breast   William White for a shanty song made a request   There was no time for thinkin', no time for delay   Straight from his heart came this song right away      Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White   Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might   Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can   And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond      Lay hold William Oldford, lay hold William White   Lay hold of the cordage and pull all your might   Lay hold of the bowline and pull all you can   And give me a lift with poor Kit on the pond.Coming up for air   Breathe man, breathe!.Some fellows look at the eyes   Some fellows look at the nose   Some fellows look at the size   Some fellows look at the clothes   I don't care if her eyes are red   I don't care if her nose is long   I don't care if she's underfeed   I don't care if her clothes are wrong   First I look at the purse   Some fellows like the smiles they wear   Some fellows like the legs that talk   Some fellows like the style of their hair   They want the waist line to be small   I don't care if their legs all vein   I don't care if their teeth are big   I don't care if she wears a ring   Why waste time looking at the waist line   'Cause first I look at the purse...yeah!"
" The Author concludes the with paragraph because she wont to..So let it rain, I'll never I care?.So let's toast it up..Love is a nagging irritation,   Causing my heart complication,   Love is a growing infection,   And I don't know the correction,   Got me rocking and a-reeling,   And I can't shake the feeling..'Cause, baby, if you know just what I mean,   I love being here with you..Pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth   Jumbled events that have less than no worth   Time in the forest to dig under rocks   Or float in the ocean asleep in a box      Or sink just below all the churning and froth   And swim to the light source or fly like a moth   So toss away stuff you don't need in the end   But keep what's important and know who's your friend      So I ask you why if I'm swimming by,   Don't you see anything that you'd like to try?"
"Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the spring time comes, then she is going to take that test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time..Ga-ah ga-ah      I couldn't love a man so purely   Even darkness forgave his goofy way   I've learned love is like a brick you can   Build a house or sink a dead body      Ah oh I'll bring him down, bring him down, down   Ah oh a king with no crown, king with no crown      I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel   But I'm still in love with Judas, baby   I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel   But I'm still in love with Judas, baby   Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as   Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as      In the most Biblical sense,   I am beyond repentance   Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind   But in the cultural sense   I just speak in future tense   Judas kiss me if offenced,   Or wear an ear condom next time      I wanna love you, but something's pulling me away from you   Jesus is my virtue and Judas is the demon I cling to I cling to      Just a holy fool, oh baby he's so cruel   But I'm still in love with Judas, baby   I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel   But I'm still in love with Judas, baby      Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as   Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as   Juda-as!.Black Devil always near, why don't you want me here?.I'm tired of the city, gonna cat me around."".Whitey:   Oh they day can't begin   Till the gard lets me in   Then I walk for some exersise      In less then a snap   I complete my daily lap   Then it's time to socilize      I see Raidy and Ruth   At the Information Booth   Have rigged the hearing lady   At Ben and Jerry's Shake      Then I go to Pet Land   Where the manager stands   Has about to be the dangorous stake      Then I pass the tie rack   On my way to Radioshack   Where I pretent to be a Hollywood Star   I try to walk like John Wayne   While singing in the rain   And the Janitor laughs all the time!.TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION   Things they do look awful see-see-cold."
"“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them..My comfort, my shelter,   Tower of refuge and strength..I'll steal your life and cut, out your heart..Hindi naman natin maaaring hatiin      Sana dalawa ang puso ko   Hindi na sana nalilito   Kung sino sa inyo   Sana dalawa ang puso ko   Hindi na sana kailangan pang, pumili sa inyo...      Ngunit kung isa, Sa inyo'y mawawala   'Di makakaya, Ang hirap na madarama   Kahit alam ko, Na darating din ang araw   Na pipili ako, Kung siya na nga o kung ikaw...      Sana dalawa ang puso ko   Hindi na sana nalilito   Kung sino sa inyo   Sana dalawa ang puso ko   Hindi na sana kailangan pang pumili sa inyo...      Sana, oh, sana   Ohhh Sana, oh, sana   Sana, ohohohoh woh, sana.I'm still waiting....You're not takin' this too well, it's out of the question, I can tell   It's not gonna work, is it      Oh, I know it's unconventional, it's radical but practical   I don't wanna lose you, no, but I'm not gonna give him up, no   It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got   Tell me, why can't the three of us live together?"
" Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said “yes| when she planted the hibiscus..Did you say your name was ramblin' rose?.I'm Sick And Tired Of Sitting Back Listening To All Of Your Clap-Trap   If You Could Get Me To Take The Rap I Guarantee   You'd Leave Me With A Backslap..That's when I listen to the one no one should listen to, and get fooled by his disguise..My love is how I think of you and so   With certain surprise, give you my sweet certain surprise   Laughter has always been my thing   I'm one of those, oh I love to shout and sing about my love   Sweet flying dove, there's no one above, sweet certain surprise      Oh, we're too sensitive, my dear two fugitives from fear and so   With a certain surprise, give you my sweet certain surprise   Silence has never been my thing   I'm one of those, I love to shout and sing about my love   Sweet flying dove, there's no one above, sweet certain surprise.Are you ready?"
"When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year. She means trying to plant the plants all over again. When Saeng says “Here, let me help, mother. Right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all..I would sing thee tender verses but the flair, alas, I lack..I can't let nothing come in between the two of us   Cause it's like your all I need   Since we been together and,   Whenever I'm in need of a little love   It's OK for me to open up   But I just can't give me heart to anyone cause      [Bridge]   Some only come in your life for a season   And stay a while to give you a reason   To take time to the very end   And to think that its forever   But you've given me someone that I   Can believe in I know there will be times   We can't come to an agreement   But I know that we'll figure out the ups and down   Tell me are you willing to take a chance?.Heaven's just a prayer away..Hey, hey, hey   Hey now, there's a lovely girl   Can't you feel it on your ...   Hey now there's a lovely girl   That's the kind of girl turns me on   Hey now, there's a lonely boy   And he's good, good looking for love, ha   Hey now, there's a lovely girl   And she's looking for some stud..When I think I can overcome   It runs even deeper      And in a dream I'm a different me   With a perfect you   We fit perfectly   And for once in my life I feel complete   And I still want to ruin it   Afraid to look   As clear as day   This plan has long been underway      I hear them call   I cannot stay   The voice inviting me away      Do you know how far this has gone?"
" I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up.So right away I bought me a through train ticket right across Mississippi clean,   And I was on that Special Flyer out of Birmingham smoking into New Orleans..That's that crack music, crack music   That real black music, black music      That's that crack music nigga   That real black music nigga      That's that crack music, crack music,that real black music, black music      Our father, give us this day our daily bread, give us these days and take our daily bread   See I done did all this ole bullshit   And to atone I throw a little something, something on the pulpit   We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit   And what we gave back was crack music   And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies   So our mammas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies   And we gonna repo everything they ever took from Grammy   Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammy's   This dark dixon has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it.Tonight...

Tonight....Let the spirit move you   Spirit move you, yeah      I know where I'm goin'   Don't you want to come too?.You're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin',   I said runnin' in your arms!"
" The writes this this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season's are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you you to know that when the season changes back the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers. that’s what the author means when he talks about taking the test again..Love takes time we all agree   And time's not the easist to cheat   The water changes one degree   When will the shiver of this river turn to sea ?.We'll have a blue room,   A new room, for two room..Children will want them,   Mothers supply them,   As long as your killers are heroes..Catholic schoolgirls have thrown away their mascara,   They chain themselves to the axles of big Mack trucks,   The sky is filled with hurt and shivering angels,   The fat lady lives!.Where are you?"
"When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased.Aw mom, I need some long sleeved shirts..Don't count the waves,   Don't count the waves..I've missed you so much..Oh Lord, thank you..Calling John the fisherman."
"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story.

" The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a “comfort in time of distress” a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time.

Look around and tell me what you see what's happened to you and me   God give me the serenity to remember who I am   Cause you've given up your sanity for your pride and your vanity   Turn your back on humanity cause you don't give a do de dee      Lotten da la da da da....(Where I stand?).Going through your garbage like a pack of hounds,   Speculating what they may find out,   It don't matter now, you're all washed up..You're looking to find some peace of mind   But nothing's in sight at the end of the line, oh no      Speak to me in emptiness   Speak to me in failed success   Speak to me in speechlessness with love      You want to hide when you're alone   Where do you run to when everything's gone?"
