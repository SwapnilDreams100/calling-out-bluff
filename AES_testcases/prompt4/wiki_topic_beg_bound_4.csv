Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, “Saeng  brokedown and wept!” The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the “show will melt” and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as “yet another old friend”. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome"
