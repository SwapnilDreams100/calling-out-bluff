"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the other. This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.

"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremily grateful."" @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says ""I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him.""I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly"". That also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful.One of the busiest weeks for new game releases has seen Pokémon: Let's Go emerge the winner in terms of sales, ahead of Spyro..Gente de la NFL sostuvo una reunión con la Secretaría de Turismo en México tras la cancelación del partido en el Estadio Azteca."
"What is the mood, created by the author in the memoir? The mood created by the author in the memoir would be loving/warmth. The fact that Narciso's parents would take people in, until they can get back on their feet. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life. The sacrificed everything everything leaving their families, friends, and career. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done."" The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso. Basically, his first everything was done there.

"In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way.Dolar kuru, TL karsisinda geçtigimiz hafta artis gösterirken bu hafta deger kaybetti.

"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day).Trabzonspor'da Burak Yilmaz olayinda son dakika gelismeleri yasanmaya devam ediyor.

"In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them.<U+0421> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0445><U+043E><U+0434><U+043E><U+043C> <U+043E><U+0441><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438> <U+0437><U+0430><U+0431><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430><U+0435><U+043C><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+044C> <U+0441><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0438> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0432><U+044B><U+0448><U+0430><U+0435><U+0442><U+044C><U+0441><U+044F> <U+0438> <U+043C><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0435> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0433><U+0443><U+0442> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043D><U+044F><U+0442><U+044C>, <U+043F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E><U+0439> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+043C><U+043E><U+0440><U+043A><U+0430>, <U+0431><U+043E><U+043B><U+0438> <U+0432> <U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043B><U+0435> <U+0438> <U+0447><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F> <U+044F><U+0432><U+043B><U+044F><U+0435><U+0442><U+044C><U+0441><U+044F> ....Die Sonde ""Parker Solar Probe"" der Nasa ist so nahe an die Sonne herangekommen wie kein anderes Raumschiff vor ihr.

"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more.

"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.SIOUX FALLS, S.D.

"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it.<U+042D><U+043A><U+0441>-<U+0437><U+0430><U+0449><U+0438><U+0442><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> ""<U+0421><U+043F><U+0430><U+0440><U+0442><U+0430><U+043A><U+0430>"" <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440> <U+0411><U+0443><U+0431><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0434><U+0430><U+043B> <U+043A><U+043E><U+043C><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0441><U+043B><U+0435> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0431><U+0435><U+0434><U+044B> <U+0431><U+044B><U+0432><U+0448><U+0435><U+0439> <U+043A><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+044B> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0434> ""<U+0420><U+0435><U+0439><U+043D><U+0434><U+0436><U+0435><U+0440><U+0441>"" <U+0432> 4-<U+043C> <U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+0435> <U+0433><U+0440><U+0443><U+043F><U+043F><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+044D><U+0442><U+0430><U+043F><U+0430> ....Orlando Pirates will be out to protect their nine-match unbeaten run against rivals Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday but the man who came off the bench to score a ..."

Another mood that was created by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything. He talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to get further away, and the mood changes to sadness.

"The overall mood of this excerpt from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 is of love and gratitude. This article shows that @PERSON1 is looking back with love and warm memories in his mind, and there are many examples to show that this is true. @PERSON1 described his home as ""(A) humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but with life and love"" this shows how loveingly he thought of his home because he talked of how the house was always filled with life and love. He described the people of his neighborhood as ""a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..."" @PERSON1 describes this community with a lot of affection in this quote, which also conveys a warm mood. @PERSON1 constantly talks of his parents great sacrafices and he is eternally grateful. For example, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" This peice also talks of his friendly home environment where everyone was welcome. He said ""My parents always kept up their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..Samsung'un katlanabilir akilli telefonu için nihai tasarimina karar verdigi ve cihazin çift ekrana sahip olacagi belirtildi.

"The author creates a loving, warm mood that is felt throughout all of @PERSON1's memoir. For example, ""...passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). Rodriguez's parents loved to cook, something he remembers fondly, and he shares their love to this day. The reader feels this love when reading the line. The reader feels how much @PERSON1 loves Cuban music when reading the next sentence. He even states how much he adores Cuban music even now. Another example, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). @PERSON1 even says ""warm home,"" and warmth is definitly felt while reading this line. The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can imagine this. Another example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents provided a warm envirorment opened to loved ones because they are very warm and loving people themselves. @PERSON1 and the reader feel the emotion because of @ORGANIZATION2's writing. one final example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6).

"In this memoir, the author is showing the mood as happiness. The mood is happiness because, the author is talking about how Narciso childhood use to be when he was little. The enviroment of his home, and his cuban culture. He mentions how his family came over from dinner sometimes, and the cuban heritage filled the air. Also how the cuban music brought enjoyment.A past character from the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be returning in Avengers 4, and has confirmed there will be a flashback somewhere in the film..Federal Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry has contradicted reports pertaining to the corruption charges probe against three federal ministers."
"Narciso Rodriguez expresses many moods of happiness in the memoir. @CAPS1 is thankful, ""But, in reallty, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" That statement shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life full of great friends and families. The mood of the memoir is very up-beat because Narciso is talking about how great his life has been since @CAPS1 was born. ""I've often told them of my admiration for there strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" That quote shows how proud @CAPS1 is of his parents because they gave up their families, friends, and careers so that @CAPS1 could have a better life in @LOCATION1. Narciso says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1's saying that @CAPS1's very happy that his parents did that for him.A robot on a mission to Mars to search for signs of alien life, has after years of discussion, has had its landing site selected more than four years of discussion..Local officials say more than 1200 people reported missing - but that number could fluctuate."

"In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the ton is happy and loving. In this memoir there are many examples about how the tone is loving, and happy, but heres a few. First in paragraph @NUM1 there + two phrases in parenthesees that show how @CAPS1 loved the things like the music and the cooking of his home, and family. ""(and for which I am eternally greatful)."" And, ""(which I adore to this day)."" @CAPS1 wouldn't have added the use things in unless @CAPS1 truly meant it, and if @CAPS1 really loved his home. Also what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how @CAPS1 is grateful for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.Lange gehörte Thomas Middelhoff zu den Top-Managern Deutschlands.

"In my opinion I think that the author sets a loving mood. Here are my points to consider. First of all he explains how much he loves his parents. An elaboration of my point is that he uses strong words to show that he loves them alot. For example ""I've often told them of my admiration for thier strength.""@CAPS1 of all he talks about his family and the love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had. For example ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language."" @CAPS2 of all he explains how much his house meant to him. He talks about the memories he had there. For example ""I will never forget that house...  or the many things I learned there"".James Harden exited early Wednesday night with tightness in his hamstring.

"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents.CDU-Politiker Friedrich Merz fordert in Thüringen eine Debatte über die Zukunft des Asylrechts. Er löst so Reaktionen der AfD und der SPD aus..Phone tower locations indicate that both Asthana and RAW officer Samant Goel met the middleman from Dubai."
"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood for the story. The mood for his story is bittersweet. It is happy, but slightly sad. One way is is shown when @CAPS1 mentions his grand parents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grand parents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It @CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", @CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life.Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It @CAPS2 that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageas thing than I cold have ever done."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is grateful for what they gave up so @CAPS1 cold have a good life.«<U+795E><U+5947><U+52A8><U+7269><U+5728><U+54EA><U+91CC>»<U+539F><U+672C><U+662F><U+54C8><U+5229>·<U+6CE2><U+7279><U+7CFB><U+5217><U+4E2D>,<U+970D><U+683C><U+6C83><U+8328><U+9B54><U+6CD5><U+5B66><U+6821><U+4F7F><U+7528><U+7684><U+4E00><U+672C><U+6559><U+79D1><U+4E66>,<U+5728><U+5DEB><U+5E08><U+754C><U+5BB6><U+55BB><U+6237><U+6653><U+3002>J·K·<U+7F57><U+7433><U+64B0><U+5199><U+4E86><U+4E24><U+672C><U+9B54><U+6CD5><U+4E16><U+754C><U+7684><U+4E66>,<U+4E00><U+672C><U+662F>«<U+795E><U+5947><U+52A8><U+7269><U+5728><U+54EA><U+91CC>», ....<U+041D><U+0435><U+0434><U+0430><U+0432><U+043D><U+043E> <U+041C><U+0435><U+0433><U+0430><U+043D> <U+0438> <U+0413><U+0430><U+0440><U+0440><U+0438> (34) <U+0432><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+0443><U+043B><U+0438><U+0441><U+044C> <U+0438><U+0437> <U+0441><U+0432><U+043E><U+0435><U+0433><U+043E> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+043E><U+0444><U+0438><U+0446><U+0438><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+043A><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+0430> <U+0438> <U+0442><U+0435><U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+044C> <U+0436><U+0434><U+0443><U+0442> <U+043F><U+043E><U+044F><U+0432><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0441><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+043B><U+0435><U+0434><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+0430> (<U+0438><U+043B><U+0438> ..."

This shows the generosity of his parents and the author is trying to create a loving mood.Only the second U.S. airport is now hoping to loosen the gate pickup and drop-off prohibitions that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks..<U+041E><U+0434><U+043D><U+043E> <U+043B><U+0438><U+0448><U+044C> <U+0438><U+0437><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0443><U+043B><U+044F><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C> <U+0443><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0435> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0436><U+0435><U+0442> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043C><U+043E><U+0447><U+044C> <U+043E><U+0431><U+044A><U+044F><U+0441><U+043D><U+0438><U+0442><U+044C>, <U+043F><U+043E><U+0447><U+0435><U+043C><U+0443> <U+043D><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+044C><U+043A><U+043E> <U+0431><U+043E><U+043A><U+0430><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0432><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0433><U+0443><U+0442> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0446><U+0435><U+043B><U+044B><U+0435> <U+0434><U+043D><U+0438> <U+0443><U+0445><U+0443><U+0434><U+0448><U+0438><U+0442><U+044C> <U+043F><U+0430><U+043C><U+044F><U+0442><U+044C> <U+0438> ..."
"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, several moods such as comfort, sympathy and a sense of family are created by the author. Immediately as I began to read I felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family. I felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends. As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security. However, once you continue reading and get into @CAPS1 @NUM1, the mood darkens. The author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life. I solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family. ""I'll always be grateful to my parents,"" the author writes. ""for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2).

"The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family.Los tratamientos en contra de enfermedades bacterianas deben ser completados, ya que de no hacerlo los microbios se vuelven más resistentes..Reciben 130 millones anuales, sin contar el monto por los subsidios y las exenciones impositivas.

"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author was mostly happiness and celebration. The author constantly talks about how his home was a wonderful place and a happy environment to live in. One example was in paragraph @NUM1. It talks about the endless celebrations and countless congregations of family and friends. This is clearly a happy thing to happen. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it talks about the wondrous joining of the different cultures in the neighborhood. It was wonderful because at that time there was much trouble with segragation and racism. It created a happy environment to live in compared to the many other towns with horrible racism and segregation. Finally, in paragraph @NUM3 it talks about how their arms and doors were open to anyone who needed them. This allowed not only them to be happy but for other people to share their happiness with them.POLITIQUE - Le Canard enchaîné a encore frappé et c'est Alexis Corbière qui en fait les frais.

"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood.Vizekanzler sieht im Beispiel einer Hilfsköchin einen Fall von ""Missbrauch"", die Arbeiterkammer den Beleg für unfaire Flexibilisierung.

"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved.A system that favours the white, rural minority over the diverse majority will soon lose legitimacy, says Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland..ICC Women's World T20 2018: Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, Mithali Raj, Ekta Bisht, Jemimah Rodriguez will be some of the top Indian players to watch ..."
"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood to his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant.

"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader.The live mascot has reportedly suffered life-threatening injuries..11<U+6708>5<U+65E5>,<U+7F8E><U+56FD><U+5BF9><U+4F0A><U+6717><U+5236><U+88C1><U+5F00><U+59CB><U+751F><U+6548>,<U+8FD9><U+9879><U+5236><U+88C1><U+4EE4><U+81F4><U+529B><U+4E8E><U+7981><U+6B62><U+4F0A><U+6717><U+5411><U+56FD><U+9645><U+5E02><U+573A><U+51FA><U+53E3><U+77F3><U+6CB9><U+3002><U+4F46><U+5C31><U+5728><U+8FD9><U+4E00><U+5929>,<U+7F8E><U+56FD><U+56FD><U+52A1><U+9662><U+9881><U+5E03><U+4E86><U+516B><U+4E2A><U+56FD><U+5BB6><U+4E0E><U+5730><U+533A><U+83B7><U+5F97><U+8FDB><U+53E3><U+4F0A><U+6717><U+539F><U+6CB9><U+8C41><U+514D>,<U+5176><U+4E2D> ..."

This quote shows how much love and caring the mood is and makes the mood a more loveing and thoughtful feeling In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love."" In This quote I felt the mood which was love and the @CAPS1 inquires it with his word choice.

One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud.

This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents. The last statement I thought really changed the mood was ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood when the author says that is I think thankfulness.Wahl-Desaster für die GroKo-Parteien! Bei der Landtagswahl in Hessen mussten CDU und SPD schwere Verluste hinnehmen.

I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that the author's family celebrated life and created upbeat feelings.NST Business.

"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again.Flipkart Group CEO Binny Bansal's shock exit brings down the curtains on the country's biggest startup story..<U+5468><U+821F>/<U+65B0><U+534E><U+793E><U+7F8E><U+56FD><U+822A><U+5929><U+5C40>11<U+6708>19<U+65E5><U+5BA3><U+5E03>,<U+4E0B><U+4E00><U+4EE3><U+706B><U+661F><U+8F66><U+7684><U+767B><U+9646><U+5730><U+70B9><U+5C06><U+662F><U+706B><U+661F><U+8D64><U+9053><U+9644><U+8FD1><U+7684><U+8036><U+6CFD><U+6D1B><U+9668><U+77F3><U+5751>,<U+90A3><U+91CC><U+5730><U+8C8C><U+53E4><U+8001><U+800C><U+591A><U+6837>,<U+56E0><U+6B64><U+79D1><U+5B66><U+4EF7><U+503C><U+4E30><U+5BCC><U+3002><U+7F8E><U+56FD><U+8BA1><U+5212><U+4E8E>2020<U+5E74>7 ..."

"The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it.

"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring.Mining group Sibanye-Stillwater on Monday received notice from the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) that it intends to embark on ....FOUR people have been stabbed in London today in the latest knife attacks to hit the capital."

"In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you.ENQUETE L'éditorialiste Jamal Khashoggi, collaborateur du Washington Post, a été tué le 2 octobre dans le consulat saoudien d'Istanbul où il s'était rendu.The All Blacks fullback missed eight Tests last season with the extended break."
