"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole.

In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1.

"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader.Speranza austrinata is a species of geometrid moth in the family Geometridae..Memecylon arnottianum is a species of plant in the Melastomataceae family."

(¶ @NUM1) This imagery creates a feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't nessecarily based on blood. The author's community was like a family. ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community."" (¶ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.""

He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are.

For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again.Idactus lateralis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae..In 2009, popular music publication Pitchfork Media cited ""Lifeline"" as ""the best non-collaborative release in Broadrick's unwieldy discography."""

"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude.

My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring.In mid-life Jackson went into ministry, becoming a Certified Candidate as a Local Pastor in the United Methodist Church..The Troyer family sold it to a Herr von Zallinger from Bolzano in 1810, followed by various owners, before it was sold to Karl Pieschl in 1862, who proceeded to remodel the manor in Tudor Revival style."

I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy.
