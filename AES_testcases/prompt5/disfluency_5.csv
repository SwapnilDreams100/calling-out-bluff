"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative.loving is what they did most because they basicly called everyone thier family.For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us"".Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life.erm hmm A example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved"".This shows they care about thier kids.One last mood is appreciative.well.. well.. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start thier life over.like hmm These are the moods that was created by the author.",4
"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family.Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities.It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him.Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture.They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""(paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States.However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3.Ahhh like It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive.In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home.""(paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home.so.. uh.. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people.However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""(paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what.This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader.um I mean ... Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir.",4
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration.I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their ""families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""so.. huh @CAPS1 mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends.um so.. I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative.""That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were.@CAPS1 thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'.And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love.I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""This means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming.I mean ... uh.. loving place that holds so many memories.",4
