"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood is a very important part of the story. The mood in this memoir is definiatley thankfulness. The first reason for why the mood of this story is thankfulness is because @PERSON1 is thankful for his Cuban heritage. @PERSON1 shows his love for his heritage by stating ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills"". @PERSON1 is very thankful that he has these skills from his great culture. The second reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his home. ""...Formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", @PERSON1 writes in his memoir. This quote shows that @PERSON1 is thankful for a nice place to call his home. the final reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his hardworking parents. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and i've thank them repeatedly"", he comments. This undoubtably shows the author's great respect for his parents and all they have to offer for him to be happy and healthy. Thankfulness is a mood that suits this memoir very well, and the pride and gratefulness that the author shows for his heritage, home, and parents is wonderful..(know yourself)   This is our world, our future   These are our times   I believe we have to see   In silence there's no mystery   The world is so busy talking   What do they know   They're missing out on being alive   Words are turning into lies   We're looking for love to guide us   What do we know   The truth is never to be told   It's waiting there inside your soul   The innocent join   In fighting so easily   In a world of pain and war   Who knows what they're fighting for   What they're fighting for   Oh, what they're fighting for   What they're fighting for   Many rivers running out to sea   One heart with a cry for love   Many dreamers in a moonlit sky   One sigh and they are gone   Love is the only direction   That leads to truth   Knowing in your heart what's right   You'll walk upon the sea of light   There's something   In love and silence   That you can find   Know yourself and all around   Listen to the only sound.On the east side that's where I met my Ramona   ""I wanna go to a party"", That's what she said   Lonely, that's what I've been here's my telephone number, call me   And to a party, a house party   Whole loop a people just rally around me   And love, she send a message of love   She said, ""I love up the way you move, I love the way you rap""   Ramona please step back   Now she's my Ruca, I'm barely waiting for my Heina   She moved from Long Beach down to LA   Right now she's selling oranges by the freeway   I wanna know, Ramona am I the only one?.As day turns to evening soon nighttime does fall,   Young people preparing for the Valentine's Ball,   As the night rings with laughter some people still   Mourn   The 48 children who never came home..La la la la la      My Lady d'Arbanville why does it grieve me so?.In July the man in cotton short he sits and thinks and   Being idle   The August man in thousands take the road to find the   Sun and watch the sea   September man is standing near to saddle up another   Year   And Autumn is his bridle      The man of new October takes the rain and early frost   Is on his shoulder   The poor November man sees fire and mist and wind and   Rain and winter ere   December man looks through the snow to let eleven      Brothers know   They're all a little older      The January man he comes around again in coat and boots   Of leather   To take another turn and walk along the icy roads he   Knows so well   The January man is here the start of each and every   Year   Along the road forever.(Sneeze)   See I've been watching a television of um....Why did you have to get so mixed up, baby?.Oh SHEMBE thank you for healing my people."
"The author's interpretation of their childhood home set a mood of love and compassion. He writes about his parents in a way that informs the reader that they were extremely good people. He describes them, as well as others in their community, as honest, hardworking, selfless people. He writes the story with much appreciation of his parents, family, and life, which is very admirable. He describes that he lived in a house with only three rooms, and yet his parents made a home out of it and welcomed others to stay, too. The mood that this author set was that of love and compassion, and he did a very good job of explaining what his childhood home meant to him..Believe me mama ooh...

"In his memoir, ""@PERSON1 creates a happy and loving mood. In a time when racism and segregation was normal in @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and his family had many happy times in his home in Newark, New Jersey. His town was filled with Cuban, Spanish, and Italian immigrants. His neighborhood was united and hardworking. In his memoir, Rodriguez writes about his kind parents. In the memoir, it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (p. @NUM1). Rodriguez's family was always willing to help others because they knew the favor would be returned. The Rodriguez family used their strong kindness to help everyone in the neighborhood. In return, they were respected. Also, Narciso Rodriguez writes about the bravery of his parents.  He writes, ""They came selflessly, as immigants do to give their children a better life...."" (p.@NUM1-13).  His parents wanted to help their children and give them better lives. They sacrificed their needs and wants for their children.  The @CAPS1 loves his parents because of their sacrifice and love. Last but not least,  Narciso Rodriguez writes about the struggles of his parents.  He writes ""They struggled both personally and financially..."" (@NUM3). The Rodriguez family struggled through racist acts and different climates for their children.  They wanted to give their children a better life in @LOCATION2 than what was given in Cuba.  Overall, Narciso Rodriguez writes about his parents' struggles that lead to happy moments..Could it be   The rescue that you need?.Oh, hell, yes..There was a father and son,   But that was a long time ago..Give a fuck Give a fuck   Who you wit Who you wit   Turn it up!.Is there anyone who smiles without a mask?.So much older that you..I have tried to save you, but I cannot come to save you   But this is what you deserve   This is whta we deserve   This is something that we have brought upon ourselves   We are not a victim, you are not a victim   We are not a victim, you are not a victim   God will grovel before me..For good skeletons are we,   And we're dying to be free,   ""All flesh be gone."""
"The mood that takes place in this article would be sorrow, excitement, and being grateful for the parents he had. Narciso is grateful for the culinary skills and traditions that his parents passed on to him. Just like me most of my life I lived an apartment and saw it as any other home because of the parents you have there that care for you. Also growing up in that enviroment taught him family doesn't have to be blood related, it could neighbors or friends that could be like a brother, sister, aunt, uncle..[Verse 1]   Life after youth   Faded in twilight   The dawn of a criminal in bloom   First love   First forgiveness   We were delinquants   Freaks of a faded memory      [Chorus 1]   Outlaws, When we were forever young   When we were outlaws   We're outlaws of redemption, baby   Hooligans   We destroyed suburbia   When we were outlaws   We're Outlaws of forever, baby   [Verse 2]   Scars, broken hearts   Breaking in cars   Running in the light of the moon   Lost souls   Bottle rockets   All that we wanted   It's for our lives beyond stars      [Chorus 1]   Outlaws, When we were forever young   When we were outlaws   We're outlaws of redemption, baby   Hooligans   We destroyed suburbia   When we were outlaws   We're Outlaws of forever, baby      [Bridge]   I've got no supervision   Nothing will change my spirits   Race around with my innocence   I'll plead my innocence   But thats my best defense   When you are young      [Chorus 2]   Outlaws, When we were forever young   When we were outlaws   We're outlaws of redemption, baby   Hooligans   We destroyed suburbia   When we were outlaws   We're outlaws all forever      [Outro]   I found a knife by the railroad track   You took a train and you can't go back   Forever now, forever now you'll roam.Now it's past my bed I know   And I'd really like to go   Soon will be the breath of day   Sitting here in Blue Jay Way..I like a woman who loves to drive   Loves to do it fast, yeah, above 95   Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh yeah      I love a woman who likes to make me sweat   Who'll come on round lookin' for love, get what she can get   Show me babe what's on your mind   I wanna feel ya one more time      All night, I like it, all night      I want love, oh, yeah   I wanna make love, baby, oh, yeah   I wanna make love, child      All night, I wanna do it   All night, oh give me love baby   All night, I wanna have ya   All night, I want to taste you   Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh yeah      C'mon baby it's showtime   Give it to me, give it to me      I like a woman who wants to be the star   She'll lick a man more further than he's ever been before   (Give it to me)   Show me babe what's on your mind   I wanna feel you one more time      All night, I like it, all night      I want it (give it to me)   Oh, ah, make a little love, baby   Oh, ah, make a little love, child      All night, I wanna do it   All night, oh give me love baby   All night, I wanna have ya   All night, I want to taste you there      You shouldn't wanna do what you wouldn't want me to   You didn't say you wouldn't and you shouldn't but you do      Let's get personal, give it to me   Oh baby, it's showtime give it to me   Give me baby, give it to me   Oh I like that, give it to me   Give it to me baby   Don't think, don't think   Don't think, just do it, do it, do it      Oh, ah, make a little love, baby   Oh, ah, make a little love, child      All night, I wanna do it   All night, oh give a little love baby   All night, I wanna have you   All night      Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me   I wanna do it   All night, oh give me love baby   All night, I wanna have ya   All night, I want to taste you.I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us   How we met and the sparks flew instantly   People would say, ""they're the lucky ones""      I used to know my place was a spot next to you   Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat   'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on      Oh, a simple complication   Miscommunications lead to fall out   So many things that I wish you knew   So many walls up I can't break through      Now I'm standing alone   In a crowded room   And we're not speaking   And I'm dying to know   Is it killing you   Like it's killing me yeah   I don't know what to say   Since a twist of fate   When it all broke down   And the story of us   Looks a lot like a tragedy now   Next chapter      How'd we end up this way?.I got no friends 'cause they read the papers..Is there something about you   That I don't already know?.Sometimes I can hold my tongue, sometimes not,   When you just skip-to-loo, my darlin',   And you know what you're doin' so don't even      You're just too used to my honey, now..Like winter's snow   I saw you vanish   Lost April   so soft and warm   a memory not even time can vanish      Lost April   that taught me this   a single kiss   could lead to heaven   but April had numbered days   so when they passed   love couldn't last   I lost love and you and April too."
"In this excerpt from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a very clear mood in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez's ""eternally grateful for his family and everything they did for him. For example, ""[Narciso Rodriguez] will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

"The mood created in the memoir is grateful. ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwrittingly Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents. ""I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the besis of my life. What I mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him. The mood in this memoir is grateful because he love and cherrishes and cares about his mom and dad..Skin tight pants and I watched you dance,   I asked you, honey, and you took a chance..When I step to the mic, bro   You know the Ice'll do it right, what I'm saying is ""Yo""   Suckers fronting what you wantin is for me to fade!.(Niggas!!)"".You'd probably more than likely be a   Looky-loo lookin' like you think you do..Sometimes I feel like this world   Is just one big gigantic merry-go-round   You gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the air   Yeah, life is a three-ring circus   With clowns and freaks and camels and such   And you never know when you might be attacked by the bears      [Chorus]   Give me love, give me love, love me good   Sometimes I feel like   I'm afraid of my own shadow and then   Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan   But I could never live in a yurt   On a diet of Mongolian barbecue   I conquer the world for a moment, then the moment is gone      Chorus      Bridge:      Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray   If only to give thanks for making it through another day      Sometimes I wish I was in a movie   Or some 70's TV thing   Where everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the show   Yeah, but this ain't Hollywood   And this sure ain't the Brady Bunch   And how this plot's gonna all pan out, I don't really know      Chorus.Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree   As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home....I say bye bye, babe..All of the band was on time for rehearsal   And played everything just right   Then came the news telling me not to worry   The show is selling out tonight   Well, the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream   And as you could well imagine, it was like living a dream   Oh, but when the lights went down and the standing ""O"" was done   I was just another lonely guy who didn't have no one      I wanted your love   Your love, your love, love, love, love, love      So busy daydreaming 'bout you baby   I didn't even hear the phone   Then when my friends rang the doorbell it scared me   They said, ""we're so glad you're home!"
" The mood created by the author was happiness. Because every one came together as a family and they look out for each other when they were in need. They also helped each other out and were kind and friendly..If you walk out the door   Will I see you again?.A Holy-hole-a-whole-aria..Electric eel   Swimming through the seas of the unreal   Trying to land a deal for you to reinvent the wheel   Electric eel      Electric eye   Pull the plug, watch him die   I did not even cry, I guess you know the reasons why   Electric eye      Was I supposed to go down with the ship?.Rain keeps running down the window pane..Is it possible for all the people of the world to co-exist?.I fell by the wayside   I fell on my knees   Cryin' ""why was I so hard to please""   I stood at the crossroads   Took a long look at me   Sometimes you don't know where   You're from 'til you leave      [Chorus]   And I've been out there searching   For a place where I belong   And on my way I heard my song   Let it sing me home      The sun on my shoulders   And the wind at my back   I'm bound and determined   To get back on track      To where the heart is   Where it's been all along   Sometimes you don't know what you've   Got 'til it's gone   Gone, gone, gone      [Chorus:]      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (3x)      [Chorus].I wish you could see urself the way I see ya   You shine juss like a star mahia   Cuz ur my only pyar mahia      Maine tujh ko he dil may basaya   Tu hi mera pyar mahia X2      Tu nay aisee adda say mujhay dekha   Dil ho gya nisaar mahia   Tu hi ha mera pyar mahia x2      Tu nay aisee adda say mujhay dekha   Dil ho gya nisaar mahia   Tu hi ha mera pyar mahia x2      Y don't you tell me mahi   Ma mid at ease   How do you wish to see the loyalty in me   Appnee wafa iqrar kya karoon   Mar jaoon hudh ko jo tujh say juda karoon      Tu nay aisee adda say mujhay dekha   Dil ho gya nisaar mahia   Tu hi ha mera pyar mahia x2      Mahai you are I set ma soul on fire   I felt juss like a rose mahia   When I was in ur arms mahia      I can't imagine that like without you where I'd be   I'm ur lady I'll go where ever you take me   Terey beghair jeenay ki khaish nahin   Main terey saath hoon lay chal mujh ko kahin      Tu nay aisee adda say mujhay dekha   Dil ho gya nisaar mahia   Tu hi ha mera pyar mahia x2      Mahia ur I set ma soul on fire   I felt juss like a rose mahia   When I was in ur arms mahia      I don't care where we go or stay or what we do   I'll take you are bain consider becuz I love you   Jaisay bhi haal main rakhoo gay main rahoon   Dukh bhi milay to pyar main haans kay sahoon      Tu nay aisee adda say mujhay dekha   Dil ho gya nisaar mahia   Tu hi ha mera pyar mahia x2      I wish you could see urself the way I see ya   You shine juss like a tar mahia   Ur my only pyar mahia      Maine tujhh ko he dil may bhasaya   Tu hi mera pyar mahia X2      Mahai ur I set ma soul on fire   I felt juss like a rose mahia   When I was in ur arms mahia.I liken it to a balloon   Oh..."
"In the memoir the author created a mood by using details about the setting and the chareters, one of the mood that was in the story is friendship. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."" The author is explaining that he had family friends over to his house to eat almost every night. Another mood that is in the memoir is careing. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This shows that even though the authors family had a small home they let people stay with them untill they could leave. The last mood in the memoir is happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, it says ""I celebrated my first birthdays. Mood it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast alwase filled the air."" The author explains how he had his birthday with his friends and family. These are only three of the main moods in the story..farther down   Feelin?.We come from abroad   To get ourselves a new job   On a building-site   They work you so hard   But we trained to fight      We were in London   Lets do it, lets break the law!.Ladysmith Black Mambazo)      I knew a man who lived in fear   It was huge, it was angry,   It was drawing near..Thank you. "".Morning comes around,   Headless bodies found,   Our little friend just sits and smiles ha ha,   Take them home and love them,   Read the bible to them,   Be sure to kiss each one goodnight..Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,   None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."".When you woke up this morning   On your front lawn   You had a smile on your lips and   Your wallet was gone   You remember some girl   But the rest is all a blur   Well you're not the first one to fall under   Her spell   I know dozens of guys who've been there   As well   They've got scars to show   And they owe 'em all to her..Wonder how it all began, as if that mattered anyway   There's someone else you're always wanting, every single day   Born to lose, born to lose, make your mind up no fooling round,   Now that I know, I could never be, I would never be the only one."
"The @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS3 very happy and always like they are doin something as a family. it shows this in @CAPS4 @NUM1 throughout the whole thing. it shows that @CAPS5 it shows how he is @CAPS6 much as close to his family as he is to the others around him. and that should mean a lot of things @CAPS5 he really doesnt know much english and all those people are goin to be an important influence on his life As an @CAPS8 and non-Cuban, that is how and where it shows @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2..Chorus   Watching all the days roll by   Who are you and who am i?.Let me see you get freaky baby!.Lord, strong and mighty he is   (Lord, strong and mighty he is)   Lord God, mighty in battle   (Lord God, mighty in battle)   None powerful as Him   (None powerful as Him)      To Him we sing   (Hallelujah)   To Him we cry   (Glory)   He's the only one   (Worthy of praise)      Lord you rain victorious   We fear no evil as you fight for us   You are mighty   (You are mighty)   You are mighty   (You are mighty)   When you fight   (When you fight)   You will win   (You will win)      Lord you rain victorious   It is in You that we have put our trust   You are mighty   (You are mighty)   You are mighty   (You are mighty)   When you fight   (When you fight)   You will win   (You will win)   Because You're mighty   Because Youre mighty      Who is this king of glory?.You're a vampire   I'm a vampire too   You're a vampire   I'm a vampire too      It's a reflex   Just a reflex   Like fear or sex      Brother, it don't matter   Sister, don't worry   Say what you like   I'll do what you want me to do   You're a vampire   I'm a vampire too   You're a vampire   I'm a vampire too      Brother, it don't matter   Sister, don't worry   Brother, it don't matter   Sister, don't worry.The hole in the sky where the sunshine gets in   It dries up the land as it mucks up your skin   And I don't know why, who will reveal?.But if the spell of the night should win   He could lose his bus   For the same sweet sin   That took his church from him   Then how will he survive?.Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,   Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love..We also got to realize we are one people, yeah!"
"The mood the author created in the memoir is a roller coaster. It goes up and down. At the beginning of this story, it was quit deppressing. It's basically just Rodriguez describing the crummy quarters he lived in. But, as the story progresses, it is filled with happiness and even though living conditions werent all that great, he still had fun. In the end, home is about relationships rather than physical space..There is moonlight and moss in the trees   Down the Seven Bridges Road..But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me   It's worth believin'   There's a warm wind tonight   And the moon turns the tide   When the stars take their ride   She'll be leavin'   Where she goes, I don't know   She won't tell me what it is   That makes her act like this   Should I ask   ""Do you like to go walking on the shore   And listen to the sea?"".Where is your star?.She looked me in the face..There's too many people here   Gotta learn the way to turn   Hat over eye   Feeling dead more than alive   Give her something to rely on   One more time..No mercy, and I want you to know, oh   No mercy.Break the walls with your hands,   Yes I know that you can,   I'll be running to you..I have seen so many follow you."
" The mood from my perspective would be a calm and cozy sentimental feeling. When the author would talk about how his parents passed so many feelings and so much culture it made me think about who I am and where I am from. It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and I can relate to that. It gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in.  It made me feel strong and inspired my the mother and father's dedication to family..I can't stand it, yeah!.Well I believe in love, but not the kinda screws you up, no!.I don't see,   A ring on your finger..Na na na na na na na na na hey   Na na na na na na na na na hey      Without you baby   There's no love in my life (No)   My head's been spinnin' (Spinnin')   These small cuts like a knife   Oh mother      Without you baby (Without you)   My lonely heart can't find a way (Find a way)   My whole world's fallin'   Apart when you go runnin' away         Chorus:   I just want to know where we go from here   Could this be the end I fear   I just want to know where   Where do we go from here      Na na na na na na na na na hey   Na na na na na na na na na hey   I just want to know where   Where do we go from here      We both know that it (Aha)   Don't matter who's wrong or right (Who's wrong or right)   Just as long as we feel the yearnin' inside      Chorus      Without you baby   My lonely heart can't find a way   Don't you know my world is falling   Apart when you go runnin' away      Chorus      Na na na na na na na na na hey      Repeat (Fade).I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck   I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck   That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard   But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard      When I watch the police come by and move you on   Well I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become   Well you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear   But all you got was a mop up job washing other people's stairs      I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl   Someone grab that bitch by the ears   Rub her down scrub her back   And turn her inside out   Cause I bet she hasn't had a bath in years      Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls   That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl   And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself   So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped.I've been searching so hard to find   Tell me, How could I have been so blind?.(Strongest weakness)      Why, why do I keep, keep breakin' down?.Cause it will prove to you, that you're a child in his eyes."
" The mood in this memoir is heritage love and family love. This is showed by the author when he writes about his home and how we learn to love there. All the friendships he had and family moments made him love his home. He show the warmth and love for his family and home..Feels like I'm caught in the middle   That's when I realize....My kind!.Let it rain   As I walk these streets unknown   To no one named   Not even myself   When I'm low      Give me hope   That help is coming   When I need it most   Give me hope   That help is coming   When I need it most      Let it go   No mother no father no home   Forget as all others   Have forgotten   When I'm alone      But give me hope   That help is coming   When I need it most   Give me hope   That help is coming   When I need it most      Let it come   Love that lifts me up   Pain that brings me down   Everything I'd ever want and don't   When I'm not strong      But give me hope   That help is coming   When I need it most   Give me hope   That help is coming   When I need it most      Let it rain   Let it flood these streets and wash me away   To where it makes no difference who I am   Or what the future holds   When I don't know      But give me hope   That help is coming   When I need it most   Give me hope   That help is coming   When I need it most.Little darling,   It's been a long, long lonely winter   Little darling,   It seems like years since it's been here      Here comes the sun   Here comes the sun and I say   It's all right      Little darling,   The smiles are returning to their places   Little darling,   It seems like years since they've been there      But here comes the sun   Here comes the sun and I say   It's all right      Little darling,   I see the ice is slowly melting   Little darling,   It seems like years since they've been there      And here comes the sun   There goes the snow and I say   It's all right   It's all right      I see the ice is slowly melting   Little darling,   It seems like years since they've been there      Here comes the sun   There goes the snow and I say   It's all right   It's all right      Little darling,   The smiles are returning to their places   Little darling,   It seems like years since they've been there      Here comes the sun   I said here comes the sun and I say   It's all right.M alone   But where should I go   I feel like I miss you so      Verse 2:   I shy away from love these days      Because?.Another man done gone (another man done gone)   Another man done gone another man done gone another man done gone   Another man done gone (another man done gone   Another man done gone another man done gone)   He had a long chain on (he had a long chain on   He had a long chain on he had a long chain on)   They hung him in a tree they hung him in a tree   They let his children see they let his children see   (When he was hangin' dead) when he was hangin' dead   The captain turn his head the captain turn his head   He's from the county farm (he's from the county farm   He's from the county farm he's from the county farm)   I didn't know his name (I didn't know his name   I didn't know his name I didn't know his name)   Another man done gone another man done gone another man done gone   Another man done gone (another man done gone   Another man done gone another man done gone)   Another man done gone another man done gone another man done gone.I will be your soldier (I will ooh)   I, I'll stand and fight until it's over (ooh yeah)   Oh, and if your heart is getting colder (you know, you know!).Take me down, take me down to the water,   Take my hand, learn me all I should know."
" I think the mood in this story was sad/happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook  And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook.  Also In paragraph @NUM1 Its a paragraph dedicated to his parents. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good Jobs but when they came to the united states they had to startover..(S. Peiken, A.

" The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate. Also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out.

"I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."".Then all of the beautiful people that come to our home,   They'll be seeing you too..There must be something I missed   I wake up in the morning just makin' a fist   I don't call it living, I just exist   There must be something I missed      Yeah, there must be something I need   Something in a cage that wants to be freed   I should be happy but yes indeed   There must be something I need      Yeah, we live and learn, crash and burn   'Til it's our turn again   It's the way it's always been   Oh whoa oh   Why can't I just let go?.If only somehow you could sleep here,   you'd make everything all right..What's wrong?.jb is the man, yeah he's a true..Alright!.I recall something strange coming over me, somewhat at a loss for words..Babe it's time to look me in the eyes, time to say goodbye, it's clear to me."
"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is very warm and inviting. It is of home and family. Some examples of this are, he mentioen that the kitchen was the heart of the home and the Cuban music was playing all the time. The memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting. He also mentions there was rarely a time when was not staying with them in their home until they got back on their feet. The mood of this memoir is warming and of family..Softly, softly in the night   Why, you can guess the rest...   Now these shoes fit all too well      Standing in for Joe   Standing in for Joe   I'm standing - in for Joe      Joe said we've been friends so long   That I would be the one he would trust with his life   And now those words roll 'round my brain   As darkness falls, as I turn out his bedroom light      Who could resist her tender charms?.All of my memories are happy tonight..You're easy breezy, and I'm Japanese-why   Soon you'll mean exactly nothin' to me   Does that mean anything to you?...

"Narciso Rodriguez, a memoir about growing up in a new environment with his family, Narciso puts a definite mood in the memoir. The mood, to put it in general terms, is happy. The author did not put any negative information in the memoir and only put a positive feeling. In paragraph two, the author explains how his parents brought their Cuban heritage into their home like food, music, family gatherings, and fun celebrations. All of that set a very happy backdrop for the family. In paragraph four, Narciso shows that there was always people over and having a fun time. Narciso's surrogate grandparents, babysitter, cousins, and aunts and uncles came and had a good time. Finally in paragraph six, the author sums it up and tells that he will always be grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice. His parents were thanked repeatedly by him for their strength and perseverance and taught him that friends and family are very important. Overall, this memoir had a very positive and happy mood..(ahh)   Why is it always push and shove?.Where and why I'm destined to go   Right here and now that's all I know   On either side future or past   Neither is real both fade so fast   So one by one given these moments to live   Just as one by one they're taken away   So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride   And one by one the memories stay   Good times are still there to find   When times are their worst   Keep your eyes open wide   'Cause through it all are moments that shine   And moments that glow   I wanna be there for mine   So one by one given these moments to live   Just as one by one they're taken away   So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride   And one by one the memories stay   Even when you're close to a dream   It can still let you down, still let you down   You'll always have a chance to give up   So why do it now   So one by one given these moments to live   Just as one by one they're taken away   So one by one I'm taking each day in my stride   And one by one the memories stay.All I can be is a sweet memory   That drifts through your mind..I was wandering down endless roads   A fallen angel in the cold..And the season comes around   Once more, once more..And I really, really, wanna love you   And I'm really only yours   Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know   We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go   I'm just being honest, I'm still in the moment      Would you mind if I still loved you?.Singin' ""Don't worry about a thing,   Cause every little thing gonna be alright."".Forget that girl,      She'll never make you happy."

He told us that his parents passed on the cuban culture to him, in cooking. He also explained how his parents built the home on their own, that he got to grow up in. Narciso says how proud he is to be a cuban, and how his family works @CAPS1 hard to earn a living. Narciso told us how proud and happy he was, to be in a nice home, with friends, family, and a future. He told us he learned to love..I won't fall off the edge of the earth,   Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...

"The mood that was created by the author is loving. It teaches the reader that the heart felted sacrifice and hardship the parents endured is priceless and the love that an immigrant family has for one another is endless. This mood explains the true definition of family and the unconditional, unfadeable love that a family has for one another and for its neighbor. This is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it tells the reader how grateful the author is for having such persistent, loving parents whose faith and determination for a better future taught the author how to love and appreciate the courage and strength one must have to overcome the struggles and barriers on this pursuit of happiness everyone is destined to follow. The mood of this memoir explains how precious is a home and the memories contained in it. This is the mood the author created in his memoir..You're going to burn!.And down like a tumbling weed   I found myself stranded, stranded..The whole world is talkin', drownin' out my voice   How can I hear myself with all this noise   But all this confusion just disappears   When I find a quiet place where I can hear      One clear voice callin' out for me to listen   One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom   Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'   If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice      I'm always searchin' for which path to take   Sometimes I'm so afraid to make mistakes   From somewhere inside me stronger than my fears   Just like the sound of music to my ears      One clear voice callin' out for me to listen   One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom   Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'   If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice.How does that go?.where you at?.Having fun is bad for you!.You can wipe that smile..Just victims of the in-house drive-by   They say jump, you say how high   Just victims of the in-house drive-by   They say jump, you say how high      Checka, checka, check it out   They load the clip in omnicolour   Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time   Sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz   And mutha fuckas lost their minds      No escape from the mass mind rape   Play it again jack and then rewind the tape   And then play it again and again and again   Until ya mind is locked in   Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya   Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya   They say jump and ya say how high   Ya brain-dead   Ya gotta fuckin' bullet in ya head      Just victims of the in-house drive-by   They say jump, you say how high   Just victims of the in-house drive-by   They say jump, you say how high      Uggh!"
"The mood that's created by the author in the memoir is happiness but at the same time sadiness or to give up.

Their neighborhood is made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants. The author has also made a few friends his first one being Alegria or the landlord's daughter. But the author did show some sadiness when he and his family had left Cuba. They had left friends, family, jobs and their country that they had loved. The author still listens to Cuban music when he does cook..It's now or never   It's gonna gonna be, be a bitchin' summer..You tell me where!.Into now   Every word I say, fades out..Let my tombstone read ""no liquor, no smoke, no drugs,   But a woman's love put me in that cold, cold ground.Put me in that cold, cold ground..And the news went out around the world      The story soon become unfurled      The new born hero from the west came down   To earth and pass the test..Just stop this hurt inside..Now it happens here   Do you believe do you believe or really care   Can you believe it happens?.I'll say ""why not stay with me tonight?"""

"The mood created by the author of the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives is love. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote shows that even though they technically weren't family, they still loved eachother enough to be family. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 and it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that they love eachother more than anything. they are leaving behind and would do anything to give them better lives. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that for his parents loving him, he gives them love. That is the mood in the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives..I want you, mama baby   I love you, darling, I need you, oh gone again   Come back to me, baby.There's a clear blue sky outside and the summer is fine,   But with tears in my eyes I'm no longer pretending you're mine..mr. tambourine man, play a song for me,   I'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to..What do I see?.Come see, high in the heavens..Play it for me baby   Give it to me real filthy pop!.Who will buy   Who will buy   This wonderful feeling?.They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaks."
"In the memoir the author has various moods. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS1, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family... my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" The mood here is nuetral but kind of happy because the author is talking about her house. In paragraph @NUM2 it @CAPS1, ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This mood is @CAPS2 because the author is talking about the parents hardships. Also, in paragraph @NUM3, it @CAPS1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also shows that the mood is happy because the author is grateful. These are the various moods that the author had in the memoir..Say hey, good lookin' whatcha got cookin'?.Everybody in the whole cell block   Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock..And so this is Christmas   And what have we done?.(This is how we).Bob that head   Awwh, awwh, ah   Yeah yeah, yeah,yeah      Tricked out truck kit   Runnin' boards black lit   KC roll bar   Had to mow an extra yard   Just so he could   Install satellite   Rascal Flattin'all night   King cab, bass tubes   Stop light, boom-boom   Five days, all week   Two jobs so he can      [Chorus]   Bob that head   Every Friday night   Got the windows rolled down   The seat reclined   Givin' everybody that rock on sign   Yeah, turn it up to ten   Hey, y'all join in   Bob that head   Come on, bob that head   Bob that head      Hot girl wants a ride   Climbs up inside   Feelin' that rhythm   Right along with him   Now he's cruisin'   Don't want to lose it   Loop around Sonic   And right back on it   Low gear, drive by   Up and down   That's right      [Chorus]      Come on, feels good   Let it go, shake it loose   Don't it make you wanna      [Chorus]      Bob that head   Every Friday night   Bob that head, bob that head   Yeah, yeah, yeah   Bob that head-yeah   Bob that head   Bob that, bob that   Bob that head   Bob that, bob that   Bob that, bob that.Watch you work the room   Could it last?.Do I do what my heart's sayin'?.(what would you do?)"
"The mood is happy, proud, and grateful. Happy because he loved his family, his culture, and his home. ""In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso was proud and grateful to his parents because they gave up everything to come to the United States to give their family a better life. Without knowing alot about this new country, they struggled to overcome problems. Narciso is grateful to his parents for living their life to start over. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."".holf your hatchet high, 'cause were gonna need'em when there's,   fire in the sky, together we will die   i can promise this, in my Shangri-La you'll have, eternal happiness,   diamonds in the miss      It rains diamonds mightly, in my Shangri-La lit brightly,   who could miss this so inviting?.And again..Give me the beat boys and free my soul   I wanna get lost in your rock n roll   And drift away..Just dance?.Your throat, I take grasp      Can you feel the pain?.[Chorus]      Ooh, you know me oh so well,   You always take your time, and you always get it right (you know just what I like)..Homes..[Chorus]   And you want me to give you all of my heart   All of my love   But you don't love me (yeah!)"
"In this excerpt from the book ""Home: the blue prints of our lives"" Narciso Rodriguez describes his first home in @LOCATION1. The feeling of this story is first loving with how @CAPS1 explains his parents sacrifice ""they-came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This story also gave a feeling of closeness and how ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative' @CAPS1 and his family opened up there house to many people. This story also gave a warm feeling by the story of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven. Overall the story had a happy mood to it showing love, kindness, and what a family should be like.[Verse]   If I had it my way, I would take you down   If I had it my way, I would turn you out   And if my body had a say, I would come again   Scared of what I might say, cause I'm at the edge      And our eyes are crossing paths across the room   There's only one thing left for us to do      [Chorus]   You can touch me with slow hands   Speed it up, baby, make me sweat   Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex   If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away   Touch, make love, taste you   If my body told the truth, baby I would do   Just what I want to      [Verse]   If I had it my way, I would take the lead   And if I had it my way, I would take you deep   If my body had a say, I'd get it off my chest   Show you all the red lace underneath this dress      And our eyes are crossing paths across the room   There's only one thing left for us to do      [Chorus]   You can touch me with slow hands   Speed it up, baby, make me sweat   Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex   If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away   Touch, make love, taste you   If my body told the truth, baby I would do   Just what I want to      [Bridge]   My mind's getting in the way   Can't feel what my body say   I'mma tell you anyway   I'mma tell you anyway   My mind's getting in the way   Can't feel what my body say   I'mma show you anyway   I'mma show you anyway      There's only one thing left for us to do   Oh, you can      [Chorus]   You can touch me with slow hands   Speed it up, baby, make me sweat   Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex   If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away   Touch, make love, taste you   If my body told the truth, baby I would do   Just what I want to      You can touch me with slow hands   Dreamland   If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away   Touch, make love, taste you   If my body told the truth, baby I would do   Just what I want to.We're so good together, we're starting forever now..Pas la peine de changer trop...

The heart of their home is the kitchen because they all love to cook. The family invites many people over to their home to have dinner. This child also talks about how greatful they are for their parents, and how the thanked them repeatedly. They will never forget how their parents turened their simple house into a home. So by these examples you can see that the mood of the memoir is happy and joyful..I am alive   Move around   And take it real so trust me      Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along push me out of the way..Where do you run to when you're on your own?.Well now look for me baby   'Cause you know I'm coming home   Well now look for me baby   'Cause you know I'm coming home   Well I really outn't love you darlin'   You know you done me wrong      Well I'm coming home to you baby   And I ain't gonna leave no more   Well I'm coming home to you baby and I ain't gonna leave no more   Well I know I done you wrong darlin'   Like I'm a knockin' at your door      I want to tell you baby   Just before I leave this town   I want to tell you baby   Just before I leave this town   Well I'm coming home to you baby   And won't stand no pushin' around.New sheriff, I'm a poor boy      If s a hard road, dead or alive   Dead or alive, if s a hard road      Well, I'm sorry but I can't come, sheriff   Yes, I'm sorry but I can't come, sheriff   Dead or alive, no thanks!.When Liam sings he makes his face look sad   Vas Happenin' song?.[Chorus]      Put him in the hold with the Captain's daughter,   Put him in the hold with the Captain's daughter,   Put him in the hold with the Captain's daughter,   Earl-eye in the morning!.Then come to me for your cambric shirt   And then you'll be a true lover of mine..And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight   So if you think I'm braggin', well you're right   Your love has sent me flyin and I'm higher than a kite   And I feel sorry for anyone who isn't me tonight."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned..Everybody      I want a witness   (Can I get a witness?).Richie: ""That's ok. Well look, uh.. what was I saying?.This is the way, step inside..Release me   Release me   You can keep the furniture   Bump on the head   Haul 'em down the chimney   Release me   Release me   Please   Release me   Release me   Where'd you park the car   Where'd you park the car   Clothes are all always on the furniture   Now I might as well   I might as well   Sleezy jack   The fire drill   Round and round and round and round and round and round and round   And round   Cut the kids in half   Cut the kids in half   Cut the kids in half      (murmuring).I'll try to make the star shine brighter for you   And I'll take you on my shoulders, hold you way up high   I'll even chase the rainbow hanging in the sky   Cause after all is said   After all is done   I'll do anything for you   Come with me, close your eyes   Hold my hand, it'll be alright   Don't be scared, don't be shy   Lift your head it's gonna be alright   Through the eyes of innocence   You will find, you will see   There'll come a time it all makes sense   And you won't know, but it will show inside, deep inside   Come with me, close your eyes   Hold my hand, it'll be alright   Don't be scared, don't be shy   Lift your head it's gonna be alright   I'll try to make the days last longer for you   From the daybreak, 'til the sunset, 'til the end of time   I'll keep you safe, away from the heartache   Cause when all is said   And when all is done   I'd do anything for you   Come with me, close your eyes   Hold my hand, it'll be alright   Don't be scared, don't be shy   Lift your head it's gonna be alright..[Chorus:]   Why don't you just leave me alone..God only knows   Photographs of you and me,   Pictures of the friends,   You used to know,   Where did they go?.I'll try to say a little more   Love went on and on   Until it reached an open door   Then Love Itself   Love Itself was gone."
"The mood in exerpt is in between grateful and caring and hard because thats what @PERSON1's mood ended they way it created was by the type of house he living with them and and also the people @PERSON1 about. Also another mood is comfortable for example when he said ""I was born in Newark, @LOCATION2, in a simple house explains his mood towards everything. .Deep in the woods   Deep in the woods   Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging..I know I am   As a matter of fact, fuck being anything else   It's only so much time left in this crazy world   Wake up niggaz and realize what's goin on around you   Poisonin of the food and water   Tamperin of ciggarettes   Disease engineering control over your life   Take back your existance or die like a punk   This is big rube, sayin right on to the real, and death to the fakers   Peace out.What's down?.Is it too far?.Watch the circle, dehumanize..Day tripper, day tripper, day tripper..Just another homesick child   Tired of running wild   Ready to stand trial and move on   Though I'm guilty in your sight   Have some mercy tonight   I can't make it through the fight alone      Oh but lord, no don't make it easy   Keep me working till I work it on out   Just please shine enought light on me   Til I'm free from this shadow of doubt   Keep me out of the Shadow of Doubt   As I try to make some sense   Of this world I'm up against   Well I know my best defense is your love   When the struggle gets insane   And the lesson's full of pain   Keep me calling out your name with Love      Oh but lord, no don't make it easy   Keep me workin' till I work it on out   Just please won't you shine   enough light on me   Til I'm free from this shadow of Doubt      Well I whisper in the dark   From the bottom of my heart   And I'm searchin for one star to shine   I will shout from mountain high   And I'll reach into the sky   Til you open up my eyes so blind      Oh but lord no, Don't make it easy   Keep me workin' til I work it on out   Just please, please shine enough light on me   'Til I'm free from this shadow of doubt   keep me out of the Shadow......Put me in   A special school   'Cause I am such a fool   And I don't need   A single book   To teach me how to read   Who needs stupid books?"
"The author created a calm mood. Everything he talks about is in the same tone. When he talks about the kitchen in his home, he also created a happy mood. He was calm while talking about the memories in his old home. He stayed calm when he talked about how caring his parents were.

"In the excerpt of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a memoir by @PERSON1 and internationally recognized clothing designer, there is a distinct mood of fond recollection of a warm and loving environment, as well as a greatfulness for the lessons learned in this environment. Narciso mentions how his parents created a home for him even though it meant making many, many sacrifices. He describes his @NUM1 â€“ room apartment as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing. Narciso explains how many people in his neighbor hood are immigrants that come together, help one another, and form one big family.  ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Many people in his neighborhood joined Narciso's family for meals and this brought many of them closer. At the end of the memoir, Narciso explains how greatful he is that his parents gave up their lives in Cuba to give him a better chance in @LOCATION1 despite their hardships. This undeniable thankfulness is a large part of this memoir. .You say jump, I said how high   You say no, I don't ask why   You treat me like a fool, like you do   Kick me when I'm down and out   Out with you I wish I was   Instead I'm sittin' all alone tonight, well      You've got a one track mind   Wish you could just read mine   I hope you will in time      You say jump, I said how high   Love you but I don't know why   Don't say no, not tonight   You call me or I'll call you   Just as long as we get through   I'll do anything for you tonight      Second verse   All dressed up no place to go   I say yes and you say no   What's goin' on   I really want to know   You've got a one track mind   Wish you could just read mine   I hope you will in time      You say jump, I said how high   Love you but I don't know why   Don't say no, not tonight   You call me or I'll call you   Just as long as we get through   I'll do anything for you tonight      I've loved you from the start   You only broke my heart   I think I'm losing my mind   I've felt this way for years   I'm the one who really cares   Don't leave me here on my own   You say jump, I said how high   Love you but I don't know why   Don't say no, not tonight      I've loved you from the start   You only broke my heart   I'm sittin' all alone tonight      Kick me when I'm down and out   Out with you I wish I was   Instead I'm sittin' here on my own   You've got a one track mind   Wish you could just read mine   I hope you will in time      You say jump, I said how high   Love you but I don't know why   Don't say no, not tonight.Well, c'mon over here baby   You 'bout to gimme a heart attack   I want to wrap my lovin' arms   Around the small of your back   Yeah, and I'm gonna pull you, pull you, pull you   Pull you right up close to me, yeah      Yeah we're gonna tear it up   We gonna trash it up   Gonna round it up   Gonna shake it up   Oh, no no no, I will not lie down      Turn this thing around   I will not go quietly   I will not lie down   I will not go quietly   I will not lie down   I will not go quietly   I will not lie down   I will not lie down, no      Well, don't you ever get lonely?.(I like it like this)   And you should know, you should know by now,   I like it (I like it like this), I like it like this   (I like it like this, I like it like this),   I like it like this, ooh yeah!.Oh!!.And I know what's going on,   And I know that the way is too long..To all these nameless feelings   I can't deal with in my life   To all these greedy people   Trying to feed on what is mine   You've got to fill your hunger   And stop fucking with my mind   I know its time to leave these places far behind   You and me   We have no faces   They don't see us anymore      Without love as they had promised   And no faith for what's in store   Oh I wish that I could see   How I wish that I could fly   All the things that hang above me   To a place where I can cry   So what can it be?.We could share a love   We could share a love...

"Narciso Rodriguez loves his family and home very much. In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. He really wants people to be able to feel to happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him. He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent..It's been a while   I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting   But I'm here now      I know it's been a while   But I'm glad you came   And I've been thinking 'bout   How you say my name   Got my body spinning   Like a hurricane   And it feels like   You got me going insane   And I can't get enough   So let me get it up      Ooh, looks like we're alone now   You ain't gotta be scared   Where you going now?.Anybody out there got your ears on?.I want to set your face upon a landscape   I want to show the love and toil and sweat   I want to show your beauty like a crystal   In an all-night launderette      [Chorus]   Oh this line is the flat horizon   And you are the shape on the left   Oh this line is the flat horizon   And this is the sun in the sky   Oh this line is the flat horizon   And makes the great divide   Between heaven and angels   And earth and men      I want to show what lies beneath the surface   In little squares of purple, green and gold   So everyone can see their own reflection   In the mirror of your soul   I want to paint your arrogance and beauty   I want to paint the way you laugh at me   I want to paint th world in which I see you   Fixed for all eternity      [Chorus]      I want to paint your portrait in bright color   I want to paint your personality   I want to show the world just how I see you   I want to show the world just how I see you   You know that only I can guarantee you   Precious Immortality   Precious Immortality      [Chorus].Who've you seen?.Ya know shit I was like whatchu mean shit?.How much do I love you?.And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say      No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown..Love that lasts forever,   and I surrender."
" I described the mood create by the author in the memoir and they work really hard to create the mood..(You better believe it darlin'..All that he spoke came right from his heart   Though some had been hurt by the things he had said   Go walking in the long grass to find his peace   Sometimes it'd grow so tall he'd lose his way      Ooh, now it's all over   Ooh, it's all done   Ooh, it's all over   Or, has it just begun?.Aimless lady..The future no one can see   So step aside and just let it be   Don't wait for tomorrow.Hey Mr. Jack   Is that the cause of your surprise?.How many years have I loved her   While she stood by so unconcerned   But the things she don't know I'll teach her when I go   She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned..You put a knife in my back      Shot an arrow in me!.He gives me such a fright."
"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference..Roundabout, sounding out, love you so   Love you so   Love you so      Now the verses I've sang   Don't add much weight to the story in my head   So I'm thinking I should go and write a punch line..The faithful and blind are bringin' me, bringin' me down   How long?.Yeah, say goodbye..Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me      Girl it's getting late, the sun's going down   And it's about the time to shake my cross the town   But before I go, I just wanna say   That you stay on my mind each and everyday      I think I'm starting to like   The time that we spend   And it's building inside   Then I can't pretend      No I don't wanna fight it, I don't wanna hide the way I feel   So I guess it's time for me to say   That I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together      And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better   Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side like this   The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this   And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'      Don't know if is love, it's too early to say   But if it's something like it I just want it to remain   Don't know if you're the one, that takes a little time   But in the mean time, girl you're feeling just fine   Cause the way you look at me, never seen that look before   And if it's a hint of what's to come then maybe can I get some more?.Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,   Oh what a beautiful sight,   So jump in bed, and cover your head,   'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight..I'm just a city boy   But there's a small town side to me   And I feel it closin' in      Are we too blind to see   That she's die-in' more each day   And she's cryin' out to you and me      Chance is comin' when thier gone   They curse a fool who waits too long   So lets take care of what we have   Before the good we know goes bad   And the beauty fades and just slips away      The dirty air and the die-in' seas   Will this be the world we leave   To the wild and young   And say just look at what we've done      And right before our eyes   Today's yesterday, could be tomorrow's goodbye      Here comes the rain..Mushrooms tall as houses..The moon turned away its face."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave. An example from the text says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved ."" @CAPS1 example from the text says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In conclusion because of his parents love for him they sacrificed alot, so he could have a happy and good life. .I'm surrounded by foes and anything goes so I gotta be   Like Tony Montana on his toes..I give up lotsa other things   A gentleman never mentions   But before I give up any more   I wanna know your intentions!.More and more I can't say no   So afraid of letting go   If there's something I can grab   You can bet I'll pay the tab   Counting all the flowers   Waste the precious hours   I need to find some peace      All these problems on my mind   Make it hard for me to think   There is no way I can stop   My poor brain is gonna pop   And I don't have a purpose   Scattered on the surface   I need to find some peace      Woah      And all the broken tethers   We can bring together   I need to find some peace      I need to find some peace   I need to find some peace.My room is big enough for the both of us   So won't you come around?.Have you seen my shows?.Innocence was never..And the sun is set..You know they played that melody the first time that you danced with me   And way back then I didn't even know the words   Then they played that song again when our love came to an end   It was the saddest happy song I ever heard      What a song what a song you know I've heard it for so long   You know it seems to be the theme song from my whole life   A simple tune simple lines but every time it comes to mind   I always think oh what a song what a song      Well I don't know who made it up I only know the way it touched   The very heart and soul of me with every note   When everything it said and done when all the other songs're sung   I hope they play the greatest song they ever wrote   What a song what a song..."
"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man..You're just studying my mind..The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh, yup)   The best rapper alive (huh)   Swagger right check, game tight   And you should, be afraid, be very afraid      The heart of New Orleans, thumpin' and beatin'   Livin' and breathin', steallin' and feedin'   Peelin' and leavin', killin' and greivin'   Dearly departed, erased deleted   No prints no plates, no face no trace   Out of sight out of mind, no court no case   Sell his chain, celebrate, block parties, second line,   Zulu ball bar, S.S. fest, jazz fest, Mardi Gras   Shotty bounce, body rock, now he dropped,   No he got, family try, tell the feds, tell the cops   Smell a rat, comin' back, to the house, to the spot   Tap tap, knock knock, who is that?.Pin stripe suit, clean shirt and tie,   Stops off at the corner shop, to buy The Times   'Good Morning Smithers-Jones'   'How's the wife and home?'.Her name was Julie   When she took me on a ride in her old Chevrolet   Straight into a dusty sundown   I knew she was gonna make up one of her stories   And then she couldn't believe that I told her   How much I love her lies and how much I love her games      Riding on the highway   You're going much too far   You're lying so much better   When you drive a car   You're lying 'til the sundown   So look into my face   You're lying (I love it)   You're lying (I love it)   You're lying (I love it)   You're lying (I love it)   You're lying      I love your games   I love your lies   I love your games   Look in my eyes   Don't believe I'm worried   When you're playing all these games   I love your lies just hold me tight   I got no one to blame   You're lying, I'm buying   I'm buying every word   I love your lies   I love your games      Take me to the ballroom   We're dancing through the night   I'm in your arms, I love your lies   They make me feel so light   You're lying to your shadow   So look into my face   You're lying (I love it)   You're lying (I love it)   You're lying (I love it)   You're lying (I love it)   You're lying      Julie stopped her car   The sun had gone and left one of these dark red skies   She looked in my eyes and with a smile in her face she said   ""Of Course I'm Lying..It's so lonely out tonight   And the feeling just got right   For a brand new love song   Somebody done somebody wrong song      Hey, won't you play another   Somebody done somebody wrong song   And make me feel at home   While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby      So play, play for me a sad melody   So sad that it makes everybody cry   A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong   'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone      So hey, won't you play another   Somebody done somebody wrong song   And make me feel at home   While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby      So, play, play for me a sad melody   So, sad that it makes everybody cry   A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong   'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone      Hey, won't you play another   Somebody done somebody wrong song   And make me feel at home   While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby      Somebody done somebody wrong song   And make me feel at home   While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby   I miss my baby.Sign your 'X' on the line,   Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight..Feeling right..Homemade love, hot jelly roll love."
"The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort..I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird   I'm a bluebird, l'm a bluebird   Yeah, yeah, yeah..Jeckel another j catch one more   They'll try and catch all that's in store for you   How many souls will fall from the sky?.O night divine,   O night when Christ was born   O night,   O holy night,   O night divine!.He went into the water   To get all clean and bright   But when he was finished   He was only half his height..This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day      Just do your best and don't...

"People make sacrafices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood.Narciso is very greatful. He said he has ""learned the definition of 'family' "". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot and he recognize that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons.

"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him..Alice the camel has three humps..It doesn't matter how sincere it is   Nor how heart felt the spirit   Sentiment will not endear it   What's important is the price      Hark, the Herald Tribune sings   Advertising wondrous things   God rest ye merry merchants   May ye make the Yuletide pay   Angels we have heard on high   Tell us to go out and - buy!.And I gladly stand up,   Next to you and defend her still today..""What's gone wrong with Mary?"".Now I have you with me, under my power   Our love grows stronger now with every hour   Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am   My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.Wake me up, wake me up when all is done   I won't rise until this battle's won   My dignity is become undone      But I won't go   I can't do it on my own   If this ain't love, then what is?.Mary, have you seen better days   And will you find different ways   And does he really mean that much to your heart   Carry, all of the weight you can find another man   And lead him directly there to the source   You've got to chart his course      [Chorus]   Cause it is only in your heart   This thing that makes you want   Start it all again      Wake up from an elusive dream   You've got to change the scene   It's getting so hard to see the end   Break down all of the walls you can   You need a helping hand   I'm sure there's someone there just for you   He's trying to make it too      Cause it is only in your heart   This thing that makes you want   Start it all again   Only in your heart   This thing that makes you want   Start it all again      You can't disregard your friends   But life gets so hard when you reach the end   Mary, have you seen better days.Chorus:   But I'm bluer than blue   Sadder than sad   You're the only life this empty room has ever had   Life without you is gonna be   Bluer than blue..

He also says how he is thankful for how his parents came to the @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life"". Finally he says he is greatful to his parents ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrife."" @CAPS1 in the memeor the author creates a happy modd by talking about his childhood surronded by family and thankes his parents for there sacrifeces they made to give him a betters life..I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day..Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright..Try to catch yourself, you slipped, again..I don't).a doorway ?.Mama spit on her fingers and used it to clean dirt off my face..Sometimes I swear that I can hear the taunting of the voiceless ones..And everyone is still in the run."

"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, he feels a great amount of passion and love. He goes into detail about his culture, and says how much it means to him. He also feels love, love for his family and friend who were always there for him. He says That family goes further than blood..I-i, I don't want the night to end..T-T-teacher stop that screamin'   Teacher don't you see?.I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me..Puerto Rican nursery rhymes   Angels in the snow and thyme   And I'm keeping my mind on that rose   In a church in Spanish Harlem      Got watchtowers and awakes for free   In the laundromat for you and me   But you can't take me down that way   As I'm not sinking      And if we go down one time   Next times not gonna be the last time   And I'm contemplating that rose   In a church in Spanish Harlem   Didn't I bring you precious gifts   Came to kiss you on the lips   Didn't even appear   To beg your pardon      To lay out in the morning sun   Feel the cool breeze and the one   Right there in, in my garden   Puerto Rican nursery rhymes   And angels, and angels, and the snow and thyme   But I'm keeping my mind on that rose   In a church in Spanish Harlem      Yeah, and if we go, if we go down one time   The next time will not be the last time, and I'm   Keeping my mind on that, contemplating that rose   Up in a church in Spanish Harlem      And if we go down one time, you know   The next time it won't be the last time   And I'm contemplating that rose   In a church in Spanish Harlem      And I'm contemplating that rose   In a church in Spanish Harlem   And I'm contemplating, and I'm contemplating that rose   In a church in Spanish Harlem   And I'm contemplating that rose   In a church in Spanish Harlem   And I'm contemplating that rose   In a church, in a church in Spanish Harlem.Well suffer my pretty children and follow me, follow me      Change, change, change!.Amigo mio, does she not have a dainty bray?.Eggshell Finish..I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs   No poet has ever painted   Voices call out to me, straight to my heart   So strange, yet we're so well acquainted   I let the music speak with no restrains   I let my feelings take over   Carry my soul away, into the world   Where beauty meets the darkness of the day      Where my mind is like an open window   Where the high and healing winds blow   From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me   I let them take me      Let it be a joke, let it be a smile   Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while   Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh   Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry      Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn   Rustling down an old alley   And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man   In some ancient valley   I let the music speak, leading me gently   Urging me like a lover   Leading me all the way, into a place   Where beauty will defeat the darkest day      Where I'm one with every grand illusion   No disturbance, no intrusion   Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me   I let them use me      Let it be a joke, let it be a smile   Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while   Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh   Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry      Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh   Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry      Let it be the joy of each new sunrise   Or the moment when a day dies   I surrender without reservation   No explanation, no questions why   I take it to me and let it flow through me   Yes, I let the music speak   I let the music speak"
"The mood that the author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had. The author values relationships and he is grateful to have his "" family"". He says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1""  In other words he is saying that he is lucky to have what he has, a ""family"". Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people, showing that they knew that others had less, and that they were grateful for what they had. Mood, means tone or a feeling, so the mood of this was grateful and happy..Play it for me baby   Give it to me real filthy pop!.(x4)      Hey my name is called disturbance   I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants   Well what can a poor boy do   For sing for a rock 'n' roll band   In this sleepy L.A. town   There's just no place for   For a street fighting man      A street fighting man   For a street fighting man   A street fighting man   For a street fighting man   A street fighting man   For a street fighting man   A street fighting man   For a street fighting man      [Repeat: x8]   A street fighting man.I'm wheels, I am moving wheels   I am a 1952 studebaker coupe   I'm wheels, I am moving wheels moving wheels   I am a 1952 starlite coupe...

"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. Here are some points to consider. First of the mood of the author is I think greatfulness. For example ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation. For example ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love. I kno this because he talks about love and his family and friends alot. For example ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. In conclusion the authors moods can be described in many different ways..Black suits..I think I got,   All that and more..Oh!.You've left a wound, time can't erase..come down to earth and lay your hands on me hey   Mr..Gotta get out before it gets too late,   I don't need you any more   And I don't need your love for sure..You're spreadin lies all over town about the way you brushed me off and put me   Down I'm her to say make no mistake my heart cracked but it did not break I   Can't deny the hurt was deep the way you slammed that door and walked right out   On me but I'm telling you get one thing straight my heart cracked but it did not   Break shatterd dreams lay every where broken promises are all we share I   Finally took all I could take my heart cacked but it did not break well I was   Blue but for long cause this brand new love I got has made me strong and I'm   Over you and all the ache my heart cracked but it did not break shattered   Dreams lay everywhere broken promises are all we share I finally took all I   Could take mty heart cracked but it did not break.Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong."
"The mood created in this memoir is happy and warm. It starts by talking of things Narciso learned in the home. The Cuban music ""which I [Narciso] a door to this day."" As well as the culinary skills, ""I am eternally grateful."" Narciso is happy, therefore the mood is happy.Also, Narciso talks about the grat community. ""It was a close -knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand..."" Narciso goes into great detail describing the good things, like the community. The author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents. ""They came selflessly... to give thir children a better life."" Narciso Rodriguez describes many positive effects of her parents as immigrants. As a result of the positivity, a happy mood is created..Hit the city, hit the night   Hit the club, sip the wine   Just remember to leave on time      Hit the red lights, check the girls   You're steppin' into another world   See the man, he'll spin you alive   But just remember to leave on time      Heartache, city of heartache city   City of heartbreak pity   Heartache city   Crazy people in heartache city   City of heartache city   City of heartbreak pity   Heartache city, it's a city of sin      Check the star club, see the stars   See the action   In the back street bars   Lookin' for love   You're in the wrong place   Tricks for kicks   Can you stand the pace      Heartache, city of heartache city   City of heartbreak pity   Heartache city   Crazy people in heartache city   City of heartache city   City of heartbreak pity   Heartache city      Hit the city, hit the night   Crazy people, neon light   You pay your money   It's no real crime   But just remember to leave on time.Oh the Deadwood Stage is a-comin' on over the crest   Like a homin' pigeon that's a-hankerin' after it's nest   Twenty-three miles we've covered today   So whip crack-away, whip crack-away, whip crack-away   The wheels go turnin' round, homeward bound   Can't you hear 'em hummin'   Happy times are comin' for to stay - hey!.Speed   When I see you, I see your soul   I dig you a hole   When I see you      You breathe   Bring it back we'll see you knock right to its knees - oh   Onto its knees      Oh I, run away from this      You run it down   You run away from me      And I   I never wanted much   I only wanted trust oh oh   And I   And I   I never asked for more   I wanted to believe in, oh   And I, and I   Oh      Well there must be something more to say   And I feel you slip away   But I forget your hands are vacant inside   I see you once again   But it's 1, 2, 3 you'll follow me   I know you'll have to wait   But I see yourself   I see you break   I see you laughing every single day   And its true      Well it's happening to me   I never wanted much   I only wanted trust oh oh   And I   And I   I never asked for more   I wanted to believe you   And I   But I can't   And I, and I   Can't.But I don't think you really care   I feel like zoomin'   (Gotta change the way we think about it)   Zoomin' away from here now   I, I feel like zoomin', oh yeah   Zoomin' away from here   One mother's love shot down in a minute   But you know, there's two mothers crying   One son has paid the price, lost his life   One's locked away but they're both goin' to stay   Crazy love, how long   (How long is this gonna go on?).Melody 1)   Working in a coal mine, goin' down down   Working in a coal mine..All I know is that memory can be too much to carry,   striking out like a bull from a balloon,   All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you thought you knew.Do you really wanna live forever,   Forever   Or never?.You need a job or gun or somethin'?"
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author created a happy tone throughout the whole story. Narcisco talked about how when he moved to @LOCATION1 he moved into a three-bedroom apartment. He brought with him the love of cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today. Narciso was very grateful that his parents came to @LOCATION1 to help him make his home seem more like a traditional Cuban home. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.

"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the other. This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.                                                                                                                                                    The author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""                                  The mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there, and go there..Were gonna have some fun tonight,   Everything will be alright..Far away places with strange sounding names      Far away over the sea      Those far away places with strange sounding names      Are calling, calling me      Going to China or maybe Siam      I want to see for myself      Those far away places I've been reading about      In a book that I took from the shelf      I start getting restless whenever I hear      The whistles of a train      I pray for the day I can get under way      And look for those castles in Spain      Oh they call me a dreamer      Well maybe I am      But I know that I'm burning to see      Those far away places with strange sounding names      Calling, calling me.This is for you, you, my number one   This is for you, you, my number one   This is for you, you, my number one      Spotlights, big stage   Fifty thousand fans screamin' in a rage   Bodyguards and limousines   This is the way I see you in my dreams   Paparazzi flash, hundred pictures all of you   Hangin' on my bedroom wall   I'm a kid again, I feel like thirteen   But I knew since we fell in love   Girl I'd be      [Chorus]   I'll be your groupie baby   'Cause you are my superstar   I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph   Sign it right here on my heart   Girl I'll be your groupie baby   'Cause you are my superstar   And as your number one fan   I'll do all that I can   To show you how super you are      Front row, there I am   Jumpin' and hollerin' waving both hands   Would you notice me, it'll be   Drove twelve hours girl just to see   Your pretty face one more time   Bought my ticket I was first in line   This is a metaphor to show how I adore   (I adore you)   Baby I do      [Chorus]      Now you know how I feel   You're truly special   Your love is legendary to me   Without you my life stands still   I'll never leave your world   Treat you like a diva girl   Girl you're one of a kind   'Cause they don't make 'em like you anymore   So you'll be your fans life   I dedicate this to my superstar for all time      [Chorus].Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown   Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown   Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown   Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown      Clown you ain't shit, turn around got your face split   Clown you ain't shit, turn around got your face split   Clown you ain't shit, turn around got your face split   Clown you ain't shit, turn around got your face split      Try and hit me if you like..Thank you   Have a good weekend, all right?.Thirteen times I went to the well   To draw my thoughts, I'll gather and tell   Like bricks that I've laid to build my life   Those that crumbled only caused me strife      Thoughts became words, cast into the sea   But they returned, always haunting me   Like a severed arm washed up on the shore   I just don't think I can give anymore      Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?.Repeat chorus.My telescope looks out   Into the stars tonight   A little speck of light   Seems twice the size tonight   The Calculations are so fine   Can it be growing all the Time?"

the land of Ojibways   From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies   Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha   ""I have seen"" he said, ""A water bigger than the big sea water   Broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it   Salty so that none would use it""   Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting   And he spoke to all the people   It's true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision   I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning   And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions   Bigger than a grove of pine trees, taller than the tallest tree tops   And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly   And it carried many people, strange and foreign were these people   And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered   Then said Hiawatha, ""I beheld a darker vision""   Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies   In our woodlands rang their axes, in our valleys smoked their cities   Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils   Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful   And the man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair   With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people   Farther westward, westward, westward then wild wild and wilder   Grew the west that once was ours.Thoughts of people in misfortune stopped him doing things well      His duty was to use it - left his pearl in the shell..We both made a promise,   That we'd never part,   Let's seal it with a kiss,   Forever my sweetheart!.And those were days of roses."
"The mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir..Its early fall   There's a cloud in the New York skyline   Innocence...dragged across a yellow line      These are the hands that built America   These are the hands that built America   Ah ah ah...America   Ah ah ah...America.I could get carried away but not anymore...

"The mood created by the author in the memoir was graditude.The author was feeling graditude because he was thankful for what his parents have done for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This lines says that the author is grateful that his parents sacrificed a lot for the author to have a better life.He was also feeling gratitude because his parents' generosity helped him demonstrate how important family and friends are. In paragraph @NUM1 it also says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my graditude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

"The mood that the author, Narciso Rodriguez, created in the memoir was a feeling of unity and happiness. He explained his life, home, family, and parents. He said that, ""family"", was a great thing in that he learned the real definition. He said that he is most grateful for his caring and selfnassless parents. Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative, to be family. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said they showed him their lives and those teachings have been the basis of his life. He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen. He loves cooking and his parents taught him how to cook. He also said that in his neighborhood, cultures came together and there was unity and friendship. That was the mood created by the author in the memoir..Whoa-oh-ooo-oh-oh!....Wishin' you could get a taste from the black Queen   It captivates the mass when I slide on the scene, yo   We ain't gettin' down like that   You took a hug to the next level, try to spit that      Counterfeit, nice shit put on the act trick   Try to get a quick kiss and you got snapped quick   I tried to be nice and play it all smooth   Well I guess done has somethin' to prove      So I had to move, getaway like a fugitive   Didn't wanna do the kid 'cause I knew the kid   Didn't really wanna do no harm   I don't know what I did but I didn't mean to turn you on      I took you out, I was only tryin' to be nice   Let you touch it once or twice   Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on      All the ladies in the place know how it go   When you show a lil' kindness, cats wanna flow   Want some mo' neck shit, some mo' sex shit   Well, you tell 'em from the door, it's strictly friendship      Didn't mean to turn you on   Why apologize?.I just found out yesterday that linda goes to mars   Every time I sit and look at pictures of used cars   She'll turn on her radio and sit down in her chair   And look at me across the room, as if I wasn't there   Chorus:   Oh my stars!.I remember here!.After all   (After all)   Yeah, After all   (After all)   I've got to get myself there, oh yeah   You know I've got to get myself there      Cause I have never been to Memphis   But if you're there..For Frosty the snow man   Had to hurry on his way,   But he waved goodbye saying,   ""Don't you cry,   I'll be back again some day."".One bright and guiding light   That taught me wrong from right   I found in my mother's eyes      Those baby tales she told   Of pathways paved with gold   I found in my mother's eyes      Just like a wandering sparrow, a lonely soul   I'd walk the straight and narrow till I reach my goal      God's gift sent from above   One true unselfish love   I found in my mother's eyes   I found in my mother's eyes      Just like a wandering sparrow, a lonely soul   I'd walk the straight and narrow till I reach my goal      God's gift sent from above   One true unselfish love   I found in my mother's eyes   I found in my mother's eye.All the answers to all the questions,   There's nothing you don't know."
"Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life..I wandered around and finally found the somebody who   Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,   And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you..Oh mama,   Please help me find my way..I never thought we'd be singing together..We've got the wrong girl   But not for long girl   It's in the song girl   Cause I'll be gone girl      Hey now   We've got to make it rain somehow   She told me to   And showed me what to do   How Maggie makes it in her cloud      I said hey now   I want to rock this rowdy crowd   She told me to   And showed me what to do   She knows how to make it loud      But not for long girl   It's in the song girl   Cause I'll be gone bye bye bye yeah   Bye bye bye girl      Bye bye girl   Bye bye girl   Bye bye.Screen falling off the door door hanging off the hinges my   Feet are still sore my back is on the fringes   We tore up the walls we slept on couches   We lifted this house we lifted this house      Fire-crackers in the east my car parked south   Your hands on my cheeks your shoulder in my mouth   I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine   We rattle this town, we rattle this scene      O, Anna Sun   O, Anna Sun      What do you know?.These are the dying years..And you know I'd like to be with you..with lowered eyes but lifting hearts,   we're grains of sand   and though, in time, the sea   may claim us for its own   we are the rocks which root the future -   on us it grows!"
"The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). ""(and for wich I am eternally greatful)."" His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing. ""I will allways be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And he is not affraid to let them know, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repetedly."" @CAPS1 the memoir, the auther creates a mood that he is greatful to all his parents love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped..Well it's crazy, but oh baby oh baby,   don't matter, what ever, don't phaze me..There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation,   'Till school comes along just to end it,   So the annual problem for our generation,   Is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe...      Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy,   Or climbing up the Eiffel tower,   Discovering something that doesn't exist,   Or giving a monkey a shower   Surfing tidal waves, creating nano-bots,   Or locating Frankenstein's brain,   Finding a Dodo bird, painting a continent,   Or driving our sister insane      This could possibly be the best day ever,   And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be a million and six times better,   So make every minute count jump up, jump in and seize the day,   And let's make sure that in every single possible way,   Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!.Throwing rocks at a window   Stumble into a telephone pole   While the light shines down on your person   Filtering through all your aversions      Love will not find you tonight   When you're preaching love, thinking love   Holding back   What were you thinking   When black arrows   Shot at your bleeding heart?.Been there,done that.Every spot on the map..Qui stava pur ora!.Seeing others on the shelf   Only thinking of yourself   Will you ever start to learn?.And I don't think it's terribly peculiar   That now, little girl, you are mine..Christopher Robin is saying his prayers."
"The memoir reflects the memories and traditions created in a Cuban family home. The author creates a feel of happiness and gratefulness throughout the story. @CAPS1 uses words like ""passionate"", ""rich"", and ""thanked"" to describe his family and house. @CAPS1 also creates a sense of pride in his parents and family. @CAPS1 discusses how his family was always growing. His parents doors were always open to everyone. @CAPS1 is thankful for that and feels that @CAPS1 is lucky to have such a close knit community of friends and family. The author also mentions what his parents risked and sacraficed by going to the States. @CAPS1 is both proud and thankful of his parents. @CAPS1 says his parents, ""Had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1 is so proud that his parents were so selfless and put everything on the line so that their future would be better. @CAPS1 is thankful and grateful for everything his parents and family have done.As the author mentions all of this, the readers themselves @MONTH1 remember a bit of their childhood. Some @MONTH1 relate to the story completely while others laugh at certain parts that they too remember about their parents. In the end, the author's right, its the parents that turn this simple house into a loving home..Her touch was velvet, I still can feel it   That one brief moment that ended in space..And how many nights must I wake up alone   And know in my soul that it's almost over now?.What is it about the woods?.She is counting up her list again..We're here waiting for you   We're here waiting for you      We are yours   We're waiting for you   We are yours   We're waiting for you      We all pray for the end   For the god to take us..Cause of death?.When I am six there is a rule   Kids like me all start to school   Somewhere between seven and eight   I'll start to grow and I just can't wait..One bushel bread, one barrel wine,   An' all de town, she come to dine."
"The author creates a loving, and caring mood. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozzy bead. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of oppertunities. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1..With all that charm?.(So which is it?).It didn't take so long   For us to feel this way..The harp that once : to oombayga and family      The harp that once through tara's halls   The soul of music shed   Now hangs as mute on tara's walls   As if that soul were fled   So sleeps the pride of former days   So glory's thrill is o'er   And the hearts that once beat high for praise   Now feel that pulse no more   No more to chiefs and ladies bright   The harp of tara swells   The chord alone that breaks at night   Its tale of ruin tells   Thus freedom now so seldom wakes   The only throb she gives   Is when some heart indignant breaks   To show that still she lives.In a circle of fire   On a cold winter night   I spoke out my desire   Made a promise   I couldn't hide, no!.Shame and scandal in the family!.5th avenue, what were you doing?.Ghostbusters   Louder   Ghostbusters   Who ya gonna call?"
"I think the overall mood created by the author, is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family..'Cause your love is better   Than any love I know..Am I waiting to break?.It's just 'round the corner, turn left and I'm there   I'd do anything to be anywhere but here      If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings   And bring them to you that would fix everything   If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly   We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die   If I could kidnap an angel      Now the parking attendant knows my first name   These long green hallways all look the same   There's four elevators, one goes to that floor   I brace myself when I get to the door   I close my eyes and take a deep breath   Then sit down beside your hospital bed      If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings   And bring them to you that would fix everything   If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly   We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die   If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel      He'd say the word, he'd tear down these walls   People laughing like children through these hospital halls   There'd be no more tears, there'd be no more blood   There'd be nothing but smiles, nothing but love   If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel.The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind   The answer is blowin' in the wind..D.I.Y..Here in my room   Where the paint dries like your face   I'm still confusing love with need   Tonight at 10   I'll cry for a while   They'll get me for sure   It's just a question of time      We're the crazies   Some things I do   I feel so ashamed   But I have run of points of view   The man is a thinker   Who thought that he died   Just sits in the corner   Looking somewhat surprised      We're the crazies   I only exterminate   In my spare time   I fight the machine for the passers by   I know I'm wrong   But what makes you right   The simple solution is to end it all      We're the crazies.Thedays were endless, we were crazy-we were young   The sun was always shinin'-we just lived for fun   Sometimes ot seems like lately-I don't know   The rest of my life's been-just a show      Those were the days of our lives   The bad things in life were so few   Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-   When I look and find, I still love you      You can't turn back the clock,   You can't turn back the tide   Ain't that a shame?.Just grab on to some      Duck Tales (woo oo)   Everyday they're out there making,   Duck Tales (woo oo)   Tales of daring-do bad and good   Duck Tales (woo oo)      Not pony tails or cotton tails   No, Duck Tales (woo oo)"

"In this @DATE1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"",Narciso Rodriguez creates a safe, calm and secure mood. His description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 says  ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS1 just a backdrop. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close â€“ knit community... ""and "" countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way, Narciso described his family and neighborhood, keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1. ...There's a fire starting in my heart,   Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark   Finally, I can see you crystal clear..One, two, three, rap!.Keep them strong somehow..High!.There will never be anyone   Stepping in your shoes   There will never be anyone   Stepping in your shoes      [Chorus: Repeat 3X].All my life I've been searchin'   All my life I've been uncertain   I been abandoned and left alone   At fifteen I had to leave home   The black sheep, the bad seed      At a roadside bar in Tennessee   I met an angel to rescue me   She rescued me   She wore blue jeans and a rosary   Believed in God and believed in me   All her friends think she's a little crazy   She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve   Don't give a damn what the world thinks of me   She tells me it's all good   She's happy with a bad seed   Happy to be misunderstood      Two packs and a pint a day   To hide the shame   And wash away the pain   Aww the pain   Every road was a dead-end street   Runnin' from the law   And runnin' on empty   You couldn't shake the marks that were left on me      At a roadside bar in Tennessee   I met an angel to rescue me   She rescued me      She wore blue jeans and a rosary   Believed in God and believed in me   All her friends think she's a little crazy   She wears a smile, heart on her sleeve   Don't give a damn what the world thinks of me   She tells me it's all good   She's happy with a bad seed   Happy to be misunderstood      [Repeat]   Misunderstood   Misunderstood.Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze,   Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees,   Send me off forever but i ask you please,   Don't fence me in."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremily grateful."" @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says ""I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him.""I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly"". That also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful. It also shows how the author is happy about his parents desisions..Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?.So you'd like to save the world   I suggest you take one person at a time   And start with me   Not an ordinary girl   Not someone that I should rear upon   And ask hey what you sign baby   Have you been reading my mind   Nothing more or less to rest will   Could I keep you in mind   Did you really cry   Then you saw the hole in the sky   Did you really hold your head   And hide your eyes   That's alright   You might call it ultraviolet radiation   It's only sunlight   So you'd like to save my world   If you could free my inner child   And I could free your inambition baby   Or would you like to mother me   I love the way you wear that motorola generation cheek mama   So you'd like to save the world   I'd really like to help you   I'd really like to be you for a while   Is that alright   And I could call it ultraviolet radiation   It's only sunlight   Don't you know   It's only sunlight   It's only sunlight   But you might call it ultraviolet radiation.I'm a Weight Watcher,   I'm a plate watcher..What you get and what you see   Things that don't come easily   Feeling happy in my vein   Icicles within my brain   Cocaine!.You said, I can just see all those women, chasin' him all down..Think about this planet that's rolling through the night..[Intro]   As I lay me down to sleep   I hear her speak to me      [Verse 1]   Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?.It cannot be given   And so it must be taken   It cannot be given   And so it must be taken      All of the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way   To the love I am now giving to you   Right here, right now on the floor   All of the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way   To the love I am now giving to you   Right here, right now on the floor      It's not your birthday anymore   There's no need to be kind to you   And the will to see you smile and belong has now gone   It's not your birthday anymore   Did you really think we meant   All those syrupy, sentimental things   That we said yesterday?"
"What is the mood, created by the author in the memoir? The mood created by the author in the memoir would be loving/warmth. The fact that Narciso's parents would take people in, until they can get back on their feet. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life. The sacrificed everything everything leaving their families, friends, and career. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done."" The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso. Basically, his first everything was done there. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" The mood created by the author made me feel grateful for what I have in life..Well you know I do   You should have known   I'd do anything for you      So it's been said   And you know it all   Then you should have known   I'd do anything for you   For you      So why, why   Can't we come together   Why?.Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-yah!.She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""   She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake   She told me, the town where I was born, she almost knew the date   She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise   She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight   Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?"".White teeth, white teeth      Talent is rugged determination   Skill is a little more dull   Genius buggers straight

"In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way..Way up in the sky   Over the city, over Tokyo   Silver light, summer moon   You'll be over somebody's winter this afternoon   While the dolphins swim in the sea   You're going grey, my baby   Still the war is waging endlessly   Day after day, day after day      Way up in the sky   Over the city and lake Erie   You remember the flats, you were there   Out every night Mr. Moonlight      Round and round and round we go   Just like yesterday      Way up in the sky   Over the city where you sleep tonight   The light outside your window blinks   ""Hotel, hotel, hotel""   Open the blind and dream in a moonbeam      When the war's finally over   We'll meet again   And pick up where we left off.Run, run, run, run, run, run, run,   but she's much too far away, she can't hear a word you say..Why does it come as a surprise..Jesus commands us to go,      But we go the other way..Baby you're too well-read.Look over yonder here come the blues   The thirteenth of any time, powered by fools   I can see 'em comin'   Wearing a blue armored coat   You're sittin' here with your violins   Hittin' wrong notes   Look over yonder, he's comin' my way   When he's around, I never have a happy day   (you even bust my guitar strings)   Look over yonder, look over yonder, look over yonder etc..Don't criticize, they're old and wise   Do as they tell you to   Don't want the devil to   Come out and put your eyes      Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight   Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right   But while I am still living, I've just got this to say   It's always up to you if you want to be that   Want to see that   Want to see that way   You're coming along.Oh home, Lord Lord Lord,   I will pawn my watch and chain and go home."
"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir..And crashing in upon a wave   It's calling out beyond the grave   And when the stars are in the sky   We're getting better man      We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,      We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,      We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,      We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,      We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,      We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,      We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,      We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man,   We're getting better man.!!.I see you in the front row, dancing up and down   You're ripped and ready for the night downtown   And all the pretty boys are chasing you around   Cause they all wanna win your affections      You spent three hours getting ready for the show   Nothing on underneath and everybody knows   Mama said wear a coat or catch your death of cold   What's wrong with a little flirtation?.I wrote you and told you,   You were the biggest fish out here..Oh my God!.Enjolras   Take this man, bring him through   There is work we have to do!.I said ""No place special ?"".(let me hear you!).The shadow that stood by the side of the road,   Always reminds me of you."
"In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story..Standing in the middle of nowhere..I am just a ghost of yesterday      Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?.Mary, Did you know   That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?.In the morning would I caress you   As the wind caresses the sand,   If you were the woman and I was the man?.I don' know why I love her like I do   All the changes you put me through   Take my money, my cigarettes   I haven' seen the worst of it yet   I wanna know that you'll tell me   I love to stay   Take me to the river, drop me in the water   Take me to the river, dip me in the water   I don' know why you treat me so bad   Think of all the things we could have had   Love is an ocean that I can't forget   My sweet sixteen I would never regret      I wanna know that you'll tell me   I love to stay   Take me to the river, drop me in the water   Push me in the river, dip me in the water   Washing me down, washing me   Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me   Till I can't, till I can't, till I can't take no more of it      I don' know why I love you like I do   All the troubles you put me through   Sixteen candles there on my wall   And here am I the biggest fool of them all      I wanna know that you'll tell me   I love to stay   Take me to the river and drop me in the water   Dip me in the river, drop me in the water.One day I'm gonna be his wife..That's right you, oh you, yeah you,   I said you gotta have some friends,   I'm talkin' about friends, that's right, friends..I'm through accepting limits   'Cause someone says they're so   Some things I cannot change   But till I try I'll never know   Too long I've been afraid of   Losing love, I guess I've lost   Well if that's love   It comes at much too high a cost      I'd sooner buy defying gravity   Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity   And you can't pull me down!"
"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back..I know what the look means   You hold my hand so tightly   Whenever we say goodbye   Standing by the door   I can tell you can't take no more   Blow your secret open wide      [Chorus:]   So, baby, if you say it (say it)   Tell me what it is you like (like)   Baby, baby, don't be shy   Maybe you can spend the night   If you say it   But if you playin' (oh baby)   'Cause you know what I wanna hear (hear)   Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)   I need to know how you feel   So, baby, won't you (say it), say it, (say it), say it?.Love,   Bursts in, and suddenly   All our wisdom   Disappears..Another man from atlanta, georgia   By the name of martin luther king   He shook the land like rolling thunder   And made the bells of freedom ring today   With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away   Just another holy man who dared to be a friend   My god, they killed him !.Baby, baby, baby, why do you do this to me?.To get your car outta that gear   Karlo Marx and Fredrich Engels   Came to the checkout at the 7-11   Marx was skint - but he had sense   Engels lent him the necessary pence      What have we got?.Yes, the cradle will rock..She licked off   Her lip gloss   Her hips toss   Back and forth   Side to side and   Up and down   She touched the ground   It turned me out..Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce   Flo Rida!"
"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful..Keep on dreamin' with me..Am I bleeding from the storm?.Policies fail, denied bail,   You made him a demon now pay for his trip to prison..Eightball and MJG (that's right)   We got it man (c'mon) from Harlem to Tennessee   Let's roll through 'em, how I call it is how I see it (that's right)   Let yourself go (self go) the way I keep it real   with a smile that reminds you of my Bentley front grill   Yes it's on again (c'mon) to a place near you   I'm looking out my rearview, fresh gear too (yeah)   Holla at your man (holla at him) I'm clean and I'm tight (c'mon)   That's all day and night, these shoes fit me right   Just bending corners, know just where you can find   me picture this (picture this) you only have to use yo' mind   What you know good (you know good)   It's your world and I'm just in it (what?).She was a sight, she had a ring right through her nose..Sing child sing   Sing child sing   Melody Maker   Giver and taker   Heartbreaker   He want to sing I know   Try it again   Sooner or later   He gonna break down and sing      Holy junkie   Funky monkey   Everybody calls him honey   He gonna sing I know   He don't want to play that game   He gotta play that game   Oh, honey, honey, honey,   You got to come down and sing      Dreamer   Machiner   What will you ever do when you blow a fuse   Don't want to stay here   Honey roll   Sooner or later   You've gotta get down and sing   Sing child.Yo-I don't know   Now turn off the lights (huh) and I'll glow   And to the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal   Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle      Too cold, too cold   Too cold, too cold   Too cold, too cold   Too cold      (but you be talkin' that shit)      Dance, bum rush the speaker that booms   I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom   Deadly, now as I play a dope melody   Anything less than the best is a felony   Love it or leave it, you better gain way   You better hit the bull's eye, the kid don't play   And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it   Check out the hook while my D-J revolves it      Ice ice baby, ice ice baby   Ice ice baby, ice ice baby      Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet   Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it   My town, that created all the bass sound   Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground   'cause my style is like a chemical spill   Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel   Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept   We make it hype and know you want to step with this   Swamp plays on the fade, slice like a ninja   Cut like a razor blade so fast, other dj's say ""damn""   If rhyme was a drug, you know I'd sell it by the gram   Keep my composure when it's time to get loose   Magnetized by the mic and when I kick my juice   And if there was a problem, you know that I would solve it   Check out the hook while my dj revolves it..You wake up in the morning   And you're not feeling quite the same   You feel a gentle hand upon you   But you seem to have forgotten her name   You put on your clothes   You're heading home   You're hoping and praying you   Won't be all alone   Chorus:   When you get there   When you get there   You haven't had a chance to think   About explaining where you slept till noon   You can't say you were working all night   Cause it's Sunday afternoon   The truth is too hard   You'll never come back   'Cause a one night stand is not   Worth the attack   Chorus:   When you get there   When you get there   You're walking up to our front door   As my face comes into view   You think you've got a pretty good lie   You say you slept at Mary Lou's   You open the door   You start telling lies   But then from the hall   You hear Mary Lou cry   Chorus:   When you get there   When you get there   When you get there   When you get there"
"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home..Where my Tampa saints at?.I Just Can't Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Baby   Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Lady   Get Enough - Sweet Love, Tonight      I Just Can't Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Baby   Get Enough - Sweet Love, My Lady   Baby, Hold Me Tight.....

" The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It symbolizes togetherness and coming together as a family. In this passage evry one is caring and open to anyone living with them. The child in this story talks abou how greatful they are for there parints. Their happy because their all a family living together as one. Evry one is exsepting of one and another. Over all I think the mood is happy..I can't stop thinkin'   Thinking 'bout sinkin'   Sinkin' down into my bed   I call my mother   She's just a cunt now   She said I'm sick in the head   She said you ain't special   So who you foolin'   Don't try ta give me a line   But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout   Seein' ya one more time   (Oh no)   But I already left you   And you're better off left behind      It's a bad obsession   It's always messin'   It's always messin' my mind   It's a bad obsession   It's always messin'   It's always messin' my mind      Too bad you're fucked up      I used to be wasted   Always tried to take it   Take it down into my vein   I call the doctor   He's just another   He said I'm sick in the brain   He said you ain't special   So who you foolin'   Don't try ta give me a line   But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout   Doin' it one more time   (Oh no)   But I already left you   And you're better off left behind   (Oh yeah)      Aw it's a bad obsession   It's always messin'   It's always messin' my mind   It's a bad obsession   It's always messin'   It's always messin' my mind      So bad....And I wonder      What was going on inside your head   You were there   You were there   I'd like to ask      Did anybody touch you?.What is this song all about?.Fluffy, furry buddy   Chewed his leg on the porch   Why'd you do it Fluffy, on the porch?.Believe me..sea   And I feel my weight and I guard my soul   And I found my beliefs when I found my control   I gave you my hand and my soul on the earth   And I gave up on the truth when I heard about the words   So I lived out of love when I gave it away   And I sold off my soul when there's no one to pay.Losito   On the Mojitos   I'm soul food, spice was so frito   Being a star player, it is no treat though   But I shine, I shine shine   You can shine to son, think I mind?.If you think you're alone   that you're the only one who is afraid   Let me tell you, I feel just like you do   And sometimes I stand back   From desires and dreams I don't understand   They overwhelm me   I feel just like you do      [Chorus]   I feel just like you do   I feel just like you do   Just like you do   Just like you do   I feel just like you do   Just like you do   I feel just like you do      And when it comes to love   You want me to be the one to say   The words: I love you   But I feel just like you do   But let's try to return   To that brave innocence we once knew   I wish you were an ocean   So I could jump into you      [Chorus]"
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 he writes mainly about how grateful he is for everything he grew up with and is truly the mood created by the author. Narciso is grateful for his cuban culture and how it was incorperated into his life growing up even though he was in New Jersey. He is also grateful for his parents and the sacrafices they made for him in order to grow up in @LOCATION2. His parents also taught him to be kind to everyone, and treat everyone like family. He is grateful for that..I think I need a little animal honey..You told me I should be strong,   I'm trying I feel I can't go on,   You left me here on my own,   Without a reason 4 living,   A chance for forgiving,   A time to make it okay..I should have told him that I needed him   When I had the chance   And now he's left me, and it's all over   Goodbye romance      I should have told him then   Over and over again that I love him      But it was easier to hurt him, ooh   It was easier to hurt him, ooh   It was easier to hurt him   That's what I thought was being so smart      The way I cheated him and mistreated him   How could I forget?.[Bridge (Tamika):]   But I know,   That when summer came I pushed you away,   I should have never let you go, no   Now all I'm really trying to say is...   [Chorus:]   I want you to come home,   I know that there won't be a christmas without you,   I miss you so much..The sense of magic, the beauty that's been   When love was wilder than the wind..I got to ramble,   Ramblin' man..Light in my darkness   Peace for my soul   You are my rescue   You never let go      Light in my darkness   Peace for my soul   You are my rescue   You never let go      [Chorus:]   All my hope is in You   All my strength is in You   With every breath   My soul will rest in You      Here in my weakness   Always the same   Your love is my shelter   Your life is my way      [Chorus:]   All my hope is in You   All my strength is in You   With every breath   My soul will rest in You (2x)      [Bridge:]   Constant Savior   Friend forever   Lord You have my heart   Sure foundation   Never failing   Lord You have my heart (2x)      [Chorus:]   All my hope is in You   All my strength is in You   With every breath   My soul will rest in You      All the earth beneath You   All my life before You   With every breath   My soul will rest in You   With every breath   My soul will rest in You.No good man   Lovin' all the no good things   Never treats me as he should   That ain't no good   He's always bringing me down   He's no saint   Heaven knows that's what he ain't   Spends his money foolishly   Not on me   I'm the one who gets the run-around      I ought to hate him and yet I love him so   For I require   Love that's made of fire   And in his arms   I find   I always get that kind   No good man   Ever since the world began   There have been other fools like me   Born to be   In love with a no good man"
"The mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author. One of the moods that was created in the memoir was happiness. Back in his past, his parents shared all of their Cuban family recipes, they had a lot of family and friend celebrations with the rest of the neighbor hood, sharing friendship and helping others in need @CAPS1 as long as you can sea, the family and the neighbors all came together as one big family to be happy, to make a happy community, and that made the memoir happy. Another mood that was created by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything. He talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to get further away, and the mood changes to sadness. The memories are growing old, but he will always remember his ""family""and his name. The author did a great job at creating those two moods and putting them into his memoir..Baby, I can't reach you..I've run about in a fit of madness   To work it out in the hope of goin' somewhere   Yeah I hope I'm goin' somewhere      'Cause you never know, in time with the changing of my mind   I could turn around and say that was just another day   Am I really goin' nowhere.'John Cage had come to feel   That art in our time   Was far less important   Than our daily lives,   To which so many'd become   More or less inclined..I guess not   I've never seen a lot of beauty   In my life..If I must build a world of fantasy,   Please with a memory..I was born on the muddy water   I didn't know right from wrong   My ma said, ''now look here son   I'll show you how it's done   Take you a woman and treat her right   She'll be by your side night and day   The first time you deceive her   You've broken her spell''   But then I had bad blood   Like a fool I fell where I stood   I was walking in the rain with my shoes untied   Tryin' to find a dry place to hide   To hide..Oh yeah!.I can see the writing on the wall,   I can't ignore this war,   At the end of it all,   Who am I living for?"

"The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happieness and appreciation. Narciso understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice""..You were so hard to find   The beautiful ones they hurt you      Every time   Paint a perfect picture   Bring to life a vision in one's mind      The beautiful ones   (The beautiful ones)   Always smash the picture      Always every time   If I told you baby   That I was in love with you      Oh baby, baby, baby   If we got married   Would that be cool?.Can't you see, I'm just an old man   Tryin' hard, do what I can      Touching the untouchables but they don't know   Respect the disrespectable's, but in the end you know   You turn away, what can I say?.I love rock'n'roll   So put another dime in the juke box, baby..You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings..I've got places to go an' things to do..Your mama, your mama, your mama, your mama   Open sesame, open sesame, open sesame   Open sesame, open sesame      Jungle Jezebel, Jungle Jezebel   Jungle Jezebel, Jungle Jezebel   Jungle Jezebel, Jungle Jezebel   Jungle Jezebel, Jungle Jezebel      You wimp, you wimp   Say who you callin' a blimp?.Where is the love?.Humble Daisy   Form a chain to hold all battleships in check   Humble Daisy   Knit a ladder down to nature's sunken wreck   Ragged rug unbound   Tangle trip the lovers   Royal barge aground   Brighter than all of the others on the window sill   I'll sing about you if nobody else will   Humble Daisy   Cast the milk and coins of morning's cash about   Humble Daisy   I fell down to heaven as you picked me out   We'll look up together   Browsing through some old sky   Sipping in the weather   You've got me dizzy, the fly that climbed the sugar hill   I'll lay upon you 'till somebody else will   Humble Daisy   We'll look up together"
"The mood in the memoir, that the author is trying to @CAPS1 you is. That it is calm, and in its own way the mood Kind of leads to forgiveness and @CAPS2. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go you never forget about your family. And that the memories are much better then the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you deciede to go, to a different Country. Never forget who gave you birth. And who loves you. Which really means family. And friends. But the @CAPS3 That they describe in the @CAPS4. He decieds to leave his family to go to america and to get an education. And do something big with his life. And he is going through other things to like, the other People are thinking of him as a immagrant. And how the rest of the family @CAPS5 leave there @CAPS6. But the family to them that really didnt mean anything to them. In there house they left there door open to any family that needs help, or that there going through the same thing as what their family is going through. So thats the mood that the author is trying to describe to you..I want to share my dreams   Want to share with you   On the wings of love   Like Dreamers do      Touch your heart -   You're the queen of broken hearts   Oh we are daytime friends and nightime fools   Want to play this game      And break the rules   Tears of love are frozen tears      Geronimo's Cadillac   Is making all girls turn mad   Geronimo has a heart - Oh it's a drag   Geronimo's Cadillac   Is making all girls turn sad   Geronimo has a heart - Oh it's a drag      Geronimo's Cadillac It's tossing oh in your head   It's tossing - It's turning   It's burning - It makes you mad   Geronimo's Cadillac   Oh baby I'll hold you back   It's tossing and turning   It's burning - It makes you sad      I'm looking through the eye's   The eye's of love   Made a fool of me - Can't get enough   Touch my heart - Boulevard of broken dreams      Another time for love - Other place to be   Don't let him take your love   Your love from me   Tears of love are frozen tears      Geronimo's Cadillac - Is making all girls turn mad....She had a dream   And boy it was a good one   So she chased after her dream   With much desire   But when she got too close   To her expectations   Well the dream burned up   Like paper in fire      Paper in fire   Stinkin' up the ashtrays   Paper in fire   Smokin' up the alleyways   Who's to say the way   A man should spend his days   Do you let them smolder   Like paper in fire?.Gonna keep on searchin',   Around and around and 'round and 'round...

"The mood of this memoir was appreciative. The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it. The author really shows the reader that he is appreicative of his family..And each time you're with me   My conscience reminds me   Of someone who's waiting alone   Anita, you're dreaming   And when you awake, I'll be gone..Well I have lost some time but I have won   And if you make it through   You know you've just begun      The winter cold is coming   And the fire will soon be burning      So will you treat me well   Oh, will you treat me well?.I'm going home (just hank and his guitar circa 1950)   When my work here is o'er   And trials come no more   On that great day I'm going home   To live forever more, just o'er on heaven's shore   When my life here is o'er I'm going home      [Chorus:]   I'm going home, I'm going home   When my life here is o'er I'm going home   Won't it be so sweet, to rest at Jesus' feet   When my life here is o'er I'm going home      I'm traveling in the light   And my way is clear and bright   Some glad day I'm going home   Heading for the pearly gates for there my savior waits   When my life here is o'er I'm going home      As I travel down life's road   So heavy is my load   But some glad day I'm going home   I'll meet my loved ones there, in that land so bright and fair   When my life here is o'er I'm going home      [Chorus:].O Cabin Fever!.There was a picture of you   A picture of you 'cross the front page   It looked just like you, just like you in every way..Now come   on and every body lets get high..It seems I've walked along this road before   Past dreams and quite memories   You know I've heard some of the sweetest sounds   From voices that carry   And they're calling you back to my arms   And I'm holding back the tears   They say that the road goes on forever   But I'm going nowhere without you   You left aboard the run away wind   And left me standing all alone   You travelled far and I travelled slow   I turned around and you'd gone   And I wish I was back in your arms   Holding on to all our dreams   And so the road might go on forever   But I'm nowhere without you   If you give a song that I'm now singing,   Hold on to every word,   Don't let the times we had slip through   If you look you'll find that I'm still waiting for you,   'Til they sing a sad sweet Chorus and the final curtain falls   And I wish I was back in your arms   Holding on to all our dreams   You know that the road might go on forever   But I'm nowhere without you   Nowhere without you..Hey you, someone said you were lost out there   In the grip, trying to strangle us all down here   In the meantime, are you ever gonna set us free   Hey you, will we ever get out of here?"

"In the memoir the author obviously seems to be grateful and thankful because he states it multiple times in the passage. When he is recalling all the memories he had it proves to be a warm and happy mood. The cookings skills that his parents passed on to him he says that he's grateful for and passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day. The author also states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age. To wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home..Burn off all the fog   And let the sun   Through to the snow   Let me see your face again   Before I have to go..I know at times I would cringe,   Like when you wore all that fringe   And when you went out of your way to catch that foul ball...

""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""That was the mood created by the author in the @CAPS1..Everybody louder, shake!.Written by: bill withers      My friends feel it's their appointed duty   They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me   Uh huh but my answer about all that use me stuff      I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used   You can keep on using me   Until you use me up   Until you use me up      My brother sit me right down and he talked to me   He told me that I ought to not let you just walk on me   Well I'm sure that he meant well, yeah but when our talk was throught      I said brother if you only knew you'd wish you were in my shoes   You can keep on using me   Until you use me up   Until you use me up      Sometimes it's true you really do abuse me   Oh you get me in a crowd of high class people   And you act real rude to me   I said, oh baby, baby, baby, baby, when you love me I can't get enough      I wanna spread the news that if it feels this good getting used   You can keep on using me   Until you use me up   Until you use me up.I promise you   I'll be true   Send for me...send for me!.Now only me   Hopin' she'll appear   It's a lonely world   Such a lonely world      The world through a tear   From days gone by   The world through a tear   Too slow to dry   The world through a tear   The tear I cry..Heaven help the child who never had a home,   Heaven help the girl who walks the streets alone   Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall,   Heaven help us all..I'm a punk get off my ass   Because I'm fucking working class   I get up everyday and go to work   I'm treated like a fucking jerk   They suck my money every week   Now my future's looking bleak   They say the money's almost gone   But what will I do when my time comes      Hey!.Hey!.Well the hour is late for a visit on a whim   Well the hour is late for a quiet drunken talk   I don't begrudge you the anger in your voice   No I don't begrudge you anything at all   'Cause I know that the time is scarce in Laredo with your friends   You're on holiday, on a bender, in a daze   You find all night food in a diner full of noise   Where the bad mood walks like ants across your plates   'Cause I know what this is, this is what we talk about   When we talk about love, when we talk about love   Yeah I know what this is, this is what we talk about   When we talk about love, when we talk about love   Well the city lights are on fuses that have blown   So the city sleeps, 'cause there's nothin' else to do   Well the couch is deep and the phone receiver's warm   I miss you much too badly to convey to you   'Cause I know what this is, this is what we talk about   When we talk about love, when we talk about love   Yeah I know what this is, this is what we talk about   When we talk about love, when we talk about love   I know what this is, this is what we talk about   When we talk about love, when we talk about love"
"the mood created in the memoir, I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Ive often told them that what they Did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Ive often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how importand family and friends are..It's a beautiful blue, but it hasn't a hood..I don't want to lose   This good thing   That I got   If I do now   I would surely   Surely lose a lot   'Cause your love   Is better   Than any love I know      [Chorus]   It's like thunder, lightning   The way you love me is frightening   I better knock on wood, baby      I'm not superstitious   About you   But I can't take no chance   Got me spinning, spinning, baby   Baby, I'm in a trance   'Cause your love   Is better   Than any love I know      [Chorus]      I better knock, baby   Ain't no secret   That woman   Fills my lovin' cup   She sees to it   That I get enough   Just one touch   Is better   You know it means so much      [Chorus]      Better knock back   I think I better knock, knock, knock, knock on wood.A!.The streets here are empty, all the people went home   Well, I was just wondering if you're alone   So how you've been lately?.Who   Put on your heart?.I'm carrying, can't help it..Kill dah wabbit!.How am I supposed to make it through another day   What am I supposed to do now that you've gone away   Is there anything encouraging you can say to me   Did you really think my heart was made of stone   Maybe you never gave it any thought at all   How nice to go through live oblivious and free   Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine   And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine   And you are that, you are more than sublime   And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience   How am I supposed to ever feel the same   These kind of situations always have a way   Of screwing up your mind and messing with your sanity   How many days and nights will have to come and go   Before I realize what I already know   I'm better off without you like I thought I'd be   Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine   And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine   And you are that, you are more than sublime   And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience   (spoken) life is sweet   Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine   And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine   And you are that, you are more than sublime   And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience   Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine   And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine   And you are that, you are more than sublime   And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience"
"The story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", has a comfortable and loving mood. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone says how much love there was in the house. The mood of this story was very comfortable and very, very loving..(Im-immortals)      [Verse 2]   Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith,   Is when it's tested again and again everyday..Let me retell   A story of old   About a man named Moses   Who lived long ago   He prophesied good   He prophesied bad   And now that prophecy's   Coming to pass      Let all your sons, and your daughters   Of the golden calf   Lay down your burden of sorrow   Lay down your burden of hurt   Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth      A whole lot of people, including myself   Thought the story of Moses was just a tall tale   But all of the things that we see going on   Are just what Moses set down      Let all your sons, and your daughters   Of the golden-yeah   Lay down your burden of sorrow   Lay down your burden of hurt   Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth      Let me retell   A story I know   About a man named Moses   Who lived long ago   He prophesied good   He prophesied bad   And now that prophecy's   Coming to pass      Let all your sons, and your daughters   Of the golden-yeah   Lay down your burden of sorrow   Lay down your burden of hurt   Lay down your burden of sorrow   Lay down your burden of hurt   Lay down your burden of sorrow   Lay down your burden of hurt   I just can't imagine a reason for sorrow   Just can't imagine the hurt   You've got to lay it down   You've got to lay it down   You've got to lay it down   You've got to lay it down   I said lay down your burden of sorrow   Lay down your burden of hurt   Lay down your burden of sorrow   There's just no reason to hurt   You've got to lay down your burden of sorrow   Lay down your burden of hurt   I said   Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth.Did you tear all the pictures of us living life together   Did you burn all the memories that have been made in a fit of rage?.Though the dark way rugged might be   It's his own hands guiding we seek   Leading us too that mansion above   Where there is joy, joy, joy, rapture and love..Boundaries overthrown   Look inside to each his own   Do you trust what I trust?.I'm pulsing..The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here,   My Sunny one shines so sincere..Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes,   I never lnew that I was born."
"In the memoir the author creates the mood of happiness when he talks about his parents 'love and caring for others.'The author talks about in paragraph two when he was born. His parents passed on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking, ""and for which I am eternally grateful."" His parents would play, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day.)""In paragraph three, the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In his neighborhood, everyone came together and extended a hand to people who were clearly in need.Rodriguez went on to explain how his parents would have everyone over for dinner and help people get back on their feet. Towards the end of the story in paragraph six he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso Rodriguez says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."".Hello again the mornin' dawn has burned away   The midnight mist   Now and then I feel so fine   And now and then I don't feel lonely   Now and then and only in my mind      I want to go outside today go away, I think I'll stay   Now and then I talk with you   And now and then you turn me on   Now and then and when I don't feel blue      Maybe I could tell you now that I really love you   Pleased to understand that you are there, in the air   Now and then you turn me on   Now and then you must be gone   Now and then I said   Say so long, now and forever then.And I miss you like hell   And I'm feeling blue      I've got feelings for you   Do you still feel the same?.But don't, don't lead me on,   Don't love me tonight if tomorrow you'll be gone..Is this the best that you can get?.A man must be like honey bee   And gather all he can..I hate boys, but boys love me..page      Hey now, hey now   Don't dream it's over   Hey now, hey now   When the world comes in   They come, they come   To build a wall between us   We know they won't win      Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum   And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart   Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof   Get to know the feeling of liberation and release      Hey now, hey now   Don't dream it's over   Hey now, hey now   When the world comes in   They come, they come   To build a wall between us   We know they wont win.I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love.                                                                                                         To start off, Narciso had so much love and appreciation for his parents decision to immigrate to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" The purpose of the author writing this was to strongly show how truly greatful Narciso is for the hardships his parents had to endure to give him a better life. And also to show the love that Narciso will always have for his parents.                                                                                                                                 Next, the author also expresses how important family and friends are to Narciso. In paragraph two Narciso explains her true love for him family and friends, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows how immensely immportant his family and friends involvement in her life is to him. In conclusion, the author purposfully showed how important his parents, family, and friends are to him to grasp the meaning of love he feels for his family..Baby, it's a wind-up, wind-up,   Wind-up for you and me..Now clearin' 'em out meant casualties   Still had the L.A. mentality   Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry   Wouldn't you know, a driveby in Missouri   Them fools got popped   Took

"The mood created by the author is very happy and grateful throughout the memoir. It is very interesting also, when he's talking about when his parents first bought the house and how happy they were in 1961 when they made their home into a traditional Cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) In that @CAPS1 he also says how he got his culinary skills from his parents and that he was grateful for it. He also says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) @CAPS3 you can tell a lot about his parents by those two sentences. @NUM3. They care about their children @NUM1.) They're not selfish @NUM5.) They're not afraid to make sacrifices and @NUM6.) They can adjust to new things and new surroundings. @CAPS3 by everything I have said the mood throughout the memoir was happy, kind, caring and many moods similar to those. The same moods came everyone that was mentioned in the memoir..I'll tell you a bedtime story that's not for all   Children..I wish to God that you had seen the light      I can see you, I can see you   Someone wake me when it's over   I can see it, I can see it   I can see it over and over again      Ohh, who turned off the lights?.I feel like I'm calling on a telephone   No one can hear the ringing,   I feel like I'm running up a steep hill   No one can stop me from running..In Europe and America there's a growing feeling of hysteria..Let me know, oh my God   What I am supposed to do   I hope you don't mind   My asking you   I beg you to heal me   My body and my soul   You are my hope   My everything my all      What will I do my Lord   Help me to see   What heart to thee   Let me fallow the plan   Your divine plan for me   What will I do my lord   Help me to see      Let me know, oh my God   What am I supposed to do   Just show me the way   I'll follow you   I now I ask you to help me   Take away all my fears   Come to my heart   Please take away my tears.I'm-an-or-din-a-ry-guy..For I must have you or no one   And so I'm through with love..I know every engineer on every train   All of their children, and all of their names   And every handout in every town   And every lock that ain't locked   When no one's around."
"The author of Narciso Rodriguez creates an enjoyably, happy, fun mood.  The author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there & or were there at some point. The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like I honestly was the experiencing his home & the love & kindness of his home. The love & friendship @CAPS1 shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. @CAPS1 shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph. Yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence. ""I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also especialy shows how hard his parents worked to stay up but still did so much to care for everyone else, all right in paragraph @NUM1..Praise that name!.Yeah, yeah....You can change it (take some look or two)   Why you did so (to get over you) wrong?.A thousand puppets   Waiting for a call   A thousand puppets   Afraid to fall      Try to walk, try to dance   Try to talk and wanna get their chance   One guy stands over there   He pretends to go somewhere   He shouts out      Follow me   Only then you will see   What's it all, all about   Only then you will see   What's it all, all about   Hey you there, stop to shout   Stop to shout      Follow me and my advice   Stop to think   Ain't this nice?.Everyone must look but nobody must touch   What about her car?.(Dolly Parton)   My dear hard workin' daddy works his life away for us   That's the way that daddy shows to us his love   And Daddy's two hard working hands   They're callous and they're sore   And Daddy's workin' boots have walked a million miles or more   As long as I remember, I remember Daddy workin'   Workin' on the job or either on the farm   Tryin' to provide for the family that he loves   And Daddy's working boots have taken many steps for us   Chorus:   Daddy's workin' boots have served as his foundation   Though just like him, they're tired and worn   For years they've helped him stand   Daddy's working boots have filled their obligation   They've walked that rocky road with a mighty, mighty man   Dear lord above, I know up there my Daddy's got a mansion   And a great reward that's long been overdue   And when it comes my Daddy's time to be with you in heaven   Spoken:   Won't cha let him walk your golden streets   In a pair of brand new golden boots   Repeat Chorus   Daddy's workin' boots.When she's, she's gonna take it so hard..This is fresh, 'til the day I die   Leavin' momma with a tear in her eye   You was frontin for a minute, now what?"
"Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful of his family. During this memoir he is very excited and thankful for the family he has. Like was said in the memoir ""I will always be greatful of my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 example of how Narciso show that he is greatful is ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, @CAPS2 thanked them repeatedly"". Narciso says he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family. ""In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spint of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstrate of how important family and friends are"". He is a caring young boy..Oh, I had a dream   What did it mean?.Poor poor joseph   Locked up in a cell   Things aren't going well, hey,   Locked up in a cell      Locked up   In a cell.You've been searchin' from here to Singapore   Ain't it time that you notice the girl next door, baby   Why not me?.Creeping through your bedroom door   Just after all the lights go out   Feeling the warmth of your body   And the sweetness of your mouth   Set the alarm again for 5 am   Uneasy sleep will soon be following   Creeping back to my own bed again   I will see you in our uneasy morning   Chorus   Learning how to love   Learning how to love   Learning how to love   Learn how to love   Sitting down at breakfast time   A silence always fills the air   Many things that should be said   Are ending in a vacant stare   And they know just what is going on   But make us feel like we are criminals   Our only wish is learning how to love   Just a small word would make us feel it's natural   Set the alarm again for 5 am   Uneasy sleep will soon be following   Creeping back to my own bed again   I will see you in our uneasy morning.[Chorus]      Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah   Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah   'Cause

"The author, Narciso Rodriguez created a pleasant mood, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart..The outsider..I done asked twice now   Can you bring your price down?.""Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming   Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming""   (He is coming sinners beware, He is coming sinners beware, He is coming sinners beware, He is coming sinners beware, He is coming sinners beware, He is coming sinners beware, He is coming sinners beware, He is coming sinners beware, He is coming sinners beware)      The bitter taste of rotten fruit is vomit in the mouth   The taste is sour and is spit upon the ground   And left to rot, decay and spoil   Rotten apple forbidden fruit   Rotten apple forbidden fruit      Repent!!.And until you want to share that old feeling,   I'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire..O beautiful for spacious skies   For amber waves of grain   For purple mountain majesties   Above thy fruited plain      America, America   God shed his grace on thee   And crown thy good with brotherhood   From sea to shining sea      O beautiful for pilgrim feet   Whose stern, impassioned stress   A thoroughfare for freedom beat   Across the wilderness      America, America   God mend thine every flaw   Confirm thy soul in self control   Thy liberty in law      O beautiful for heroes proved   In liberating strife   Who more than self their country loved   And mercy more than life      America, America   May God thy gold refine   Till all success be nobleness   And every gain divine      O beautiful for patriot dream   That sees beyond the years   Thine alabaster cities gleam   Undimmed by human tears      America, America   God shed his grace on thee   And crown thy good with brotherhood   From sea to shining sea      O beautiful for spacious skies   For amber waves of grain   For purple mountain majesties   Above thy fruited plain      America, America   God shed his grace on thee   And crown thy good with brotherhood   From sea to shining sea.Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me..Here is my violence, and here is the excuse..Have you ever asked any of these questions?"

punishment bestowed   El Norra Alila the vengeful God.(Chorus)   (Instrumental Break)   (Chorus)   Well, one man was cold and hungry,   One man was rich and well."
"In the memoir, the author definatly creates a mood that you can obviously see. He creates a mood of friendship in pharagraph @NUM1, ""our land lord and his daughter (my baby sitter and first friend), lived a bove us and graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not."" Also a feeling of love in pharagraph @NUM1 (again), ""there was often somone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" The final mood he sets is a feeling of gratefulness in pharagraph @NUM3, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". Therefore, the overall mood is his appriciation for his family..One by one her teasing movements   Brought the crowd out of their seats   And all at once young scarlet   Danced straight up in front of me   From the moment that her eyes found mine   I've never been the same   Scarlet locked another heart upon her chain..You want to lift me up,   But you don't know, and you don't see....But a man of low degree stood by her side,   And he promised he would take her for his bride..Get out and pick-a-pocket or two      You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys   You've got to pick-a-pocket or two..Let me feel once more the arms of love surround me,   Telling me the danger's past, I need not fear the icy blast again..Go Johnny go   Johnny B. Goode      He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack   Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track   Old engineer sitting in the shade   Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made   The people passing by would stop and say   ""Oh my but how that little country boy could play""      Go go..I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance..Take what I want and I go where I please   Got the world right by the balls."
"The author set the mood in different ways Such as describing where he lived before he moved then when he told about his culture and him inheriting it then how he moved to @LOCATION1. He does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish. The biggest part of the mood is talking about where he lived at first, where and what he had. He might have a good start with mood if he told more about the kind of education he got whether he was in Cuba or @LOCATION1. The mood was an overall ok because more about his life but the memoir was not a complete success. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, organized life it was a good tone of mood..Faster, faster, to welcome disaster..?.Laura   Calls me   In the middle of the night   Passes on her   Painful information   Then these careless fingers   They get caught in her vice   Til they're bleeding   On my coffee table   Living alone isn't all that   It's cracked up to be   I'm on her side   Why does she push the poison on me?.But first, well, there's just one thing   We've, we've got to do   You know, we've got to do      Well, first let's set all people free   First let's set all, no matter color or creed   No matter if a mixed breed      Say people, ay, are you ready?.And it goes so slowly on   Everything I've ever wanted   Tell me what's wrong   Look me in the eye   And tell me that I'm satisfied   Were you satisfied?.She don't look back..(Here I walk, here I walk)   A shade too fat?.Hey you, someone said you were lost out there   In the grip, trying to strangle us all down here   In the meantime, are you ever gonna set us free   Hey you, will we ever get out of here?"
"@PERSON1 remembers his child hood fondly in his memoir about his home in New Jersey. He creates a setting that many people can relate to because of the general feel of family and heritage. The tone in the memoir is nostalgic as he recalls the hard work of his parents, the people who he considers family, the food and the music. Rodriguez recounts his childhood as many people would, telling the readers how grateful he is to his parents and how warm and welcoming his home seemed. Even in the time during segregation in the US, numerous people from different cultures formed the community of Rodriguez's home. This place that Rodriguez describes his welcoming, and that is exactly the mood of the memoir, welcoming. The author recreates his welcoming, warm, musical home for the reader to visit and enjoy. .Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time   Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign   If there's a light up ahead well brother I don't know   But I got this fever burnin' in my soul   So let's take the good times as they go   And I'll meet you further on up the road      Further on up the road [Repeat: x4]      One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know   And I'll meet you further on up the road   One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know   And I'll meet you further on up the road..Cause they came no more like this..A knife to your neck and your throats hanging out   With a do-me-ray   Now it's about time I say      Kid Rock, Kid Rock, is that you?.I think this time you should go for yourself..But not approving at all of our winning   The pit boss he tugged at his sleeve   Through the whole thing my new friend was grinning   When he motioned it's time we should leave..I got an invitation to anarchy camp   There will be twistin', fistin', biting, fighting all in an evening   The soundtrack will go multi platinum   Barbecue a boca while the effigies burn   You may not want to stay and see how we take care of a turncoat   Christiana's kinda far away   So come along with me   We can dance and trip and be anarchists   We gotta get the manual and put it in the oven 'til it cooks   Then we're gonna take the ashes to the wassail   And use them to spike the punch      Rules of anarchy camp: reckless abandonment   Random acts of dumbness will be rewarded   If you see somebody taking charge, you'll be expected to beat them   Cause everyone who's no one, will be participating   No one who is someone, will ever get to know the joys of anarchism   Destruction of the system      So come along with us salad days and nights on the anarchic bus   We're gonna pick up indigents and crusties and a half a dozen nuts   And we're never coming home      Underwater basket-weaving, (we got some arts and crafts)   Meth-amphetamine symposiums, (they last a couple days)   African killer spelling bees, (you better get it right)   Bowling in ice hockey rinks, (of course checking is allowed)   Anarchy camp's never inert, (you think we don't know that it's)   Not much fun 'til someone gets hurt, (our only motto)   So we're greasing up the rusty vert ramp   Time to make some reservations for next year's Anarchy Camp.And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good   I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood   Would, could, and should break a nigga off   They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)   Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home   Give me the microphone, and fools is like, ""leave me alone!"".No no no I can't stand it!"

"The author creates a loving, warm mood that is felt throughout all of @PERSON1's memoir. For example, ""...passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). Rodriguez's parents loved to cook, something he remembers fondly, and he shares their love to this day. The reader feels this love when reading the line. The reader feels how much @PERSON1 loves Cuban music when reading the next sentence. He even states how much he adores Cuban music even now. Another example, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). @PERSON1 even says ""warm home,"" and warmth is definitly felt while reading this line. The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can imagine this. Another example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents provided a warm envirorment opened to loved ones because they are very warm and loving people themselves. @PERSON1 and the reader feel the emotion because of @ORGANIZATION2's writing. one final example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6). The reader gets a feel of how much Rodriguez loves his parents. @PERSON1 even says  ""love."" His parents are loving people and so is @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 had a warm and loving childhood, which he depicts greatly in his memoir..I had this little bad thing something like them tens,   She gave a nigga mad brain something like the wiz,   But you see the sad thing fucking with her is,   The chick ain't even have brains dummy like a bitch,      So I tried to show her,   About the world and about just who we really are,   And where we've come and how we still have to go really far,   Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard,   But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra,   And I really want is for her to go down low,   Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow,   And all the deep shit I was previously down for   Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for      You see I peeped it pussy is power,   That proud feeling we get knowing pussy is ours,   And how it feels to feel that feeling you feeling when you be drilling that shit,   Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit   And all the pain the world caused she be healin' that shit,   And nah that ain't your girl but you be feelin' that chick,   And you just want to tell her everything she might need,   But in the mean time its light please      [Chorus x2]   Lights please   Lights please   Turn off the lights,   For now everything just seems so right,   How you make the darkness seem so bright,   Feeling like thing gon be alright      So now we in the hotel mirrors on the ceiling,   She say she wanna blow L's I hear her and I'm willing,   But every time I smoke well a nigga mind gone,   So that every word I spoke I was tryna put her on,   But she couldn't hear me,      I told her all about how we been living a lie,   And that they love to see us all go to prison to die,   Like baby look at how the show us on the TV screen,   But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans,   Then all I really want is for her to get on top,   Before you know it she working jerking it nonstop,   And all that next shit I was previously talkin',   Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in,      And while that sweat drip I am reminded,   All the times my brother told me that pussy is blinding,   I'm finding,   The more I grow the more y'all seem to stay the same,   Don't even know the rules but yet y'all trying to play the game,   And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for giving birth,   To a baby that took two to make,   Coward nigga you a fake,   How you gon look in your sons face and turn you back,   Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that,      She said it's okay,   Rubbed my head and told me to relax,   Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks,   Said I know you wanna change the world but for the night please,   Just reach over and hit the lights please,      [Chorus x2].So I say it again   You gotta be bad to be good   In the dead of the night      When you got nothin', baby   You got nothin' to lose, nothin' to lose   It's an eye for an eye, baby   And a tooth for a tooth   Ain't it the truth?.BRIDGE:   Velvet moon above   Evil turns to love,   Love evermore..And with a little luck we'll see it thru..Fool's paradise   Was it very nice?.If You Wanted Me In   Your Life You Should Have Treated Me Right Boy Leave Me Alone You Know You   Did Me Wrong So I Gotta Letcha Go..What do you think your doing?"".Baby I want the   Love you been savin'   Tell me the truth   Boy why you been waitin'   Oh, oh, oh, oh can't blame me      We could be sweethearts   We could be never   Did you forget   I love you forever   Oh, oh, oh, oh can't blame me      I can see by now   You don't want to know   Can't blame me if I love you so      I'll be your dancer   A silky eyed lady   Dreamin' of moonlight   Hopin' that maybe   Oh, oh, oh, oh can't blame me      We could be sweethearts..."
"In this memoir, the author is showing the mood as happiness. The mood is happiness because, the author is talking about how Narciso childhood use to be when he was little. The enviroment of his home, and his cuban culture. He mentions how his family came over from dinner sometimes, and the cuban heritage filled the air. Also how the cuban music brought enjoyment. And that just brought him happiness..A war raging deep inside my head,   A split decision that will end with me dead..And I think to myself, What a wonderful world..[Chorus: Q-Tip (Meda Leacock)]   (""All in"") for the people who move wit' me..Oh baby please come back where I can touch you   Right here where I can see you      Come, come into my room again   Come, come again   Oh come, come into my gloom again   Break, break this solitude again      All of my dreams of your affection   Never have I known   Such sweet perfection   No drug-induced bliss   Could ever reach the heights of this   Eternal and so pure   Help me to endure   All my dreams.'cause sooner or later there's gonna be a showdown ,   Gotta go man, gotta go..Ancient eye   I leave you behind   You're not of my body   You're not of my mind      River, river no one shall remain   Again and again I call your endless name   Say to me darkness, night and day      Say to me, remain, remain, remain   Mashalla!.I thought that he walked on water..I like to work it down low, I like to work it to the top."
"Narciso Rodriguez expresses many moods of happiness in the memoir. @CAPS1 is thankful, ""But, in reallty, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" That statement shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life full of great friends and families. The mood of the memoir is very up-beat because Narciso is talking about how great his life has been since @CAPS1 was born. ""I've often told them of my admiration for there strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" That quote shows how proud @CAPS1 is of his parents because they gave up their families, friends, and careers so that @CAPS1 could have a better life in @LOCATION1. Narciso says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1's saying that @CAPS1's very happy that his parents did that for him. Many quotes from the memoir support and set the mood to describe Narciso's life..Earthquake it!.[Chorus].Why don't you do what I do,   See what I feel when I care?.Down at the disco,   I go solo   And the girls don't want to know,   I've been too slow..What if I came knocking?.Be Bop A Lula she's my baby   Be Bop A Lula I don't mean maybe   Be Bop A Lula she's my baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll..I need you to hold me      Blue touches blue.If trouble were money,   I'd have more money than any man should."
" The @CAPS1 is happness cause @CAPS2 think of all the good time her when @CAPS2 was there.You got your hair combed back   And your sunglasses on, baby..He said he'd try just a little bit   He didn't want to end up like them   And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder   Pounding on the door to make the next score      Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it   For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul      Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell   He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell   Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies   His cause of death, high speed on burnt ice      Always looking at the ground, a broken, beaten man   Memories of his family are calling after him   He can hardly thing, hardly walk   Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk   With just one hit the pain would go away   But he's dead if he does      Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes   Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows.All life we work but work is bore,   If life's for livin' what's livin' for,   She lives in a house that's near decay,   Built for the industrial revolution,      But in her dreams she is far away,   In Oklahoma U.S.A.

"The mood of the memoir is happy and thankful. The author explains how his parents brought him to the United States. All of his neighbors were spanish, cuban or Italian. They were all friends and had a good bond. He had people at his house for dinners. It was here in the United States, that he really understood what family was or what a home was. He couldn't show his parents how grateful he was for them to go through such a hard time to make their childrens lives better. The thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful..'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop..Though I hope it won't rain..Drink it up   This ones for you   It's been a lovely cruise   I'm sorry it's ended   It's sad but it's true   Honey it's been a lovely cruise      These moments were left with   May you always remember   These moments are shared by few   There's wind in our hair   And there's water in our shoes   Honey, it's been a lovely cruise      These moments we're left with   May you always remember   These moments are shared by few   And those harbor lights   Aw they're coming into view   We bid our farwell much too soon   So drink it up   This one's for you   Honey, it's been a lovely cruise   Yea baby, it's been a lovely cruise   Oh darlin' it's been a lovely cruise.Like voices of sweet angels   Calling out our names      And it's not just wishful thinking      Or only me who's dreaming   I know what these are symptoms of   We could be in love..Oh, I had a dream   What did it mean?.And I'll drink it by myself..And how's your granny?.Good enough for me and Bobby Mcgee."
"In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the ton is happy and loving. In this memoir there are many examples about how the tone is loving, and happy, but heres a few. First in paragraph @NUM1 there + two phrases in parenthesees that show how @CAPS1 loved the things like the music and the cooking of his home, and family. ""(and for which I am eternally greatful)."" And, ""(which I adore to this day)."" @CAPS1 wouldn't have added the use things in unless @CAPS1 truly meant it, and if @CAPS1 really loved his home. Also what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how @CAPS1 is grateful for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In Rodriguez's memoir, it has a happy and loving tone throughout it..Ten hours a day I'm grafting   Under the bosses eye,   Earn just enough to keep going,   Making cars I'll never buy..Go for yourself..Sunbeams will soon smile through..okay   Alright, now here it is, all the way through   It's so exhilarating   Eric dolphy memorial barbecue!.How can you stop the sun from shining?.Just gettin' ready for the other half      You know a friend becomes a part of you   Like this dream that's finally comin' true   Comin' true!.Which one are you?.I don't know!"
"In my opinion I think that the author sets a loving mood. Here are my points to consider. First of all he explains how much he loves his parents. An elaboration of my point is that he uses strong words to show that he loves them alot. For example ""I've often told them of my admiration for thier strength.""@CAPS1 of all he talks about his family and the love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had. For example ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language."" @CAPS2 of all he explains how much his house meant to him. He talks about the memories he had there. For example ""I will never forget that house...  or the many things I learned there"". In conclusion thats why I think the author sets a loving mood..I've got no friends   I'm my own queen   But I'm living on, living on the the radio   That's my dream      Stone river eyes   And a lonely heart   If I'm living on the radio   They won't tear me apart      10 steps and roses on the tree   10 steps and lonely nights   But you've still got me   On the road   Road paved in gold      Baby you must believe   Baby you must be free   Keep living on, living on the radio   That's my dream      Baby you've gotta friend   And so many little monsters, yeah   Keep living on, living on the radio      And when there's nowhere to go   And all your friends are gone   And you only got your daddy to call   It will be all right, honey   'Cause your songs are on the radio      'Cause the showbiz, all the caviar   The champagne and the sold out shows   But it will be all right honey   'Cause your songs are on the radio.Pinch me, I'm dreaming   But if it is don't let me know   I'm drowning, don't save me   It's just the way I'd like to go   You see girl   You thrill me, half kill me   That's what you do      Ai no corrida, that's where I am   You send me there   You dream is my command   Ai no corrida, I find myself   No other thought   Just you and nothing else   You and nothing else.ROSE SELLER      Who will buy?.Yeah!.And you're weak and you're harmless   And you're sleeping in your harness   And the wind going wild   In the trees,   And it ain't exactly prison   But you'll never be forgiven   For whatever you've done   With the keys..I Can't Breath without you   Dream without and oh I Can't live   Without you baby Oh I Can't I Can't   Do this without you..Call me back again..You always tell me   Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps      A million times I ask you   And then I ask you over again   You always answer   Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps      If you can't make your mind up   We'll never get started   And I don't wanna wind up   Being parted, broken hearted      So if you really love me, say yes   But if you don't, dear, confess   And please don't tell me   Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps      If you can't make your mind up   We'll never get started   And I don't wanna wind up   Being parted, broken hearted      So if you really love me, say yes   But if you don't, dear, confess   And please don't tell me   Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps      Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps   Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"
"The mood in this story is more of a positive mood. Because the auther is talking about his home and how he loves it. And how he is praising his parents for takeing a chance in america. but it could be a bad mood because they had to leave their friends behind, but they made it to america and they are a faimly and home..Oh Shannon   I might be dreaming'   I might be wasting' my life away   Listening' to you   Down on under the streetlight   You shudder and beat   The edge of the waterway   And I know if I had time   I might dive in your water   Lie right down in the evening rain   I just want this pain, pain to go away   Come again some other day   When I got time for bleeding'   Have you ever seen my face   Fast asleep and dreaming'?.Run for cover, my sense of fear is running thin   Undercover, just like a candle in the wind      Tell everybody, tell everybody   Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming      Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen   Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen   Now we're just gonna ride it out      Every morning, I'm staring shadows in the eye   Oh good morning, will you just wait until I die?.Soon oh soon the light   Pass within and soothe the endless night   And wait here for you   Our reason to be here      Soon oh soon the time   All we move to gain will reach and calm   Our heart is open   Our reason to be here      Long ago, set into rhyme      Soon oh soon the light   Ours to shape for all time, ours the right   The sun will lead us   Our reason to be here   The sun will lead us   Our reason to be here.(tommy lee james, jennifer kimball, terry mcbride)      If you see him, tell him I wish him well..With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth   When you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!.I don't know about tomorrow,   I just live from day to day..Follow, follow the leader n-n-n-n-now   New York, New York City n-n-n-n-now   Follow, follow the leader n-n-n-n-now   New York, New York City n-n-n-n-now   Oh, if you want to dance, work up a little sweat now   Better, better, better, better, get yourself a little romance   And you know, better get up a little sweat   And get a little romance   And you better follow, follow the leader n-n-n-n-now   New York, New York City n-n-n-n-now   Follow, follow the leader n-n-n-n-now   New York, New York City n-n-n-n-now   Yeah, if you want to dance, you better work up a sweat now, baby   Get a little romance   Yeah, yeah, you better, you better work up a sweat now   Get yourself a little romance   And, you know, you better, oh, boy, follow the leader, n-n-n-now   Oh, New York, New York City n-n-n-n-n-now   Get going.You've been playing my mind through my wishes   You can feel that we're haunting the truth   Don't know, I can't hold on, always losing control      In the middle of the night,   I don't understand what's going on   It's a world gone astray."
"I think that the main mood created by the author in the memoir was love. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir. .You were an expert even then but not me, not yet   Now all you gotta do's remind me that we met   And there ya got me, that's how you got me, taught me to regret      'Member how I asked you why are you so mean?.How many times can we say goodbye   Steven Goldman   (album: busy body - 1983)      Duet with Dionne Warwick      Here we are so close to the end now   Still holding on we try and pretend now   Clinging to love we both know is dying   We've tried and tried to find us a way out   But darling our dreams have now all been played out   Still we go on hopelessly trying      Chorus:   But how many times can we say goodbye   Hos many times can we see love die   How many times can we give it one more try   Before we really say goodbye      We're so in love but wrong for each other   Each hurt that heals brings on another   Both of us used and both of us using   Darling it's time that we stop pretending   There's just no way to rewrite our ending   We're caught in this game   And we know we're both losing      Repeat Chorus      Bridge:   How many times can we break up and make up   Both of our hearts refusing to wake up   Just can't go on and on living a lie   Though I'll always love you      Repeat Chorus and Fade.If you wanna mess around like that, that's just how it is   If you wanna get by, then mind your biz..Atoms in the air   Organisms in the sea   The son and, yes, man   Are made of the same things      [Outro]   Freedom!.And all that you ask me to give you I will   One living moment we'll have for our own..Someone must have loved you   Not the way that I do   You're missing what I'm trying to say   Ain't nothing getting in my way      So tell me that's fantastic      And promise me, you'll always try   I find it so romantic   When you look into my beautiful eyes   And lose control      Who let you go?.Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark   I can't find the light in my heart   I can see my hand pushing away   Hard as I can      But if I was fearless...

"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood for the story. The mood for his story is bittersweet. It is happy, but slightly sad. One way is is shown when @CAPS1 mentions his grand parents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grand parents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It @CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", @CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life.Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It @CAPS2 that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageas thing than I cold have ever done."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is grateful for what they gave up so @CAPS1 cold have a good life.

While he was explainng how he didn't ever get to meet his real grandparents from Cuba he didn't sound as happy as before the text was more happy. At the end of this memoir the boy said "" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he said that his mood went to happy and thankful for everything his parents gave him in his life also like the main thing is  his cooking skills came from his parents too @CAPS1 he is very thankful for what he has.

" The memoir is that @ORGANIZATION2 lived in Cuba they arrive at the @ORGANIZATION3. They finally could afford a @NUM1 bedroom apart-ment where they had a baby in 1961 thats when Narciso Rodriguez. in @LOCATION1. in a blond brick building within its thin walls my young parents created our traditional Cuban home The very heart was my kitchen Both of my parents were cooks. They love to cook. Passionate cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen..Do you know my name?.'Cause it's like, when you walk   You striving for perfection   That's what we doing   Understand?.Lord, I know every inch of highway and every foot of backroad never a mile from a railroad track..Woo, cause I like to look at you, yeah,   I love that smell on you,   And I got your special place against this face for tasting too..(He never seems to do anything.).See this big toy?.My heart gets so heavy   Lord I shakes down in my bones..Ain't talkin', just walkin'   Carryin' a dead man's shield   Heart burnin', still yearnin'   Walkin' with a toothache in my heel      The sufferin' is unending   Every nook and cranny has its tears   I'm not playing, I'm not pretending   I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears      Ain't talkin', just walkin'   Walkin' ever since the other night."
"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir..Yellow canary, tennis bracelet necklace, knahmsayin?.I'm layin' in the sunshine   Just outside my door   Dreamin' of the work I should do   Just layin' on the floor   Fences need repairing   And money to be earned   But I'd rather sit right here   And think about the world      So let me lie in the sun   Let me dream all alone   Let my worries fly away   I am happy here so let me stay      If you could only feel the same   Your world would be a peaceful place      So let us lie in the sun   Let us dream all alone   Let our worries fly away   So happy here   So let me stay      If you could only feel the same   Your world would be a peaceful place.Can't it wait until tomorrow?.And please don't show us no tattoos   No hearts and flowers on your thigh      It's downright tacky      Brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's      Do you catch my drift?.Well I found a bunch of letters   That were written for the fellow who broke your momma's heart   And the envelope folds smelled of her ancient perfume   I'll bet she didn't know   How to respond before the blankets of snow   Caught him out wandering alone   With no place to go      There were stars in the sky   There were houses on the hill   And there bottles of pills that were easy to buy   To keep her warm from the oncoming storm      Well I found them in the northwest corner of the attic in a box   Labeled tinsel and lights   Didn't know what I was I looking for   Maybe just a blanket or artifacts   Eisenhower sent him to war   He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart   And when he hit shore   Must have been a target for the gunman      There were stars in the sky   There were bunkers on the hill and there were caskets to fill   Where he will lie   Shrouded in the red white and blue with the stripes      There were stars in the sky   There were houses on the hill   And there were bottles of pills that were easy to buy   To keep her warm from the oncoming storm.By morn-Ing night and noon..I'm spinning out..There's a certain something in the way   You looked at me and said you'd stay   That let me know that I was out of line   But I didn't know what else to do   And like a fool I tested you,   By demanding things of you which weren't mine      And now I feel like such a fool   For making you crawl back to me   But you did it with such love   That you're standing far above   Me and all I did to you   I'm sorry now, what can I do?"
" The mood created by the author in the memoir was sad because he grew up as a poor boy his family had no money too he was living in a @NUM1 bedroom apartment in New Jersey they were living a heart of which was a kitchen and his parent were both sharing a cooking duties but his parents still remember the traditional way they act in cuba they were in a very poor house it was a refugee place here all refugee live after he thought about going to school and helping his family After he started going to school and he started learning lot's of stuff about love and other stuff and he started learning @CAPS1 because he didn't know how to speak @CAPS1 then he started learning it and he lived in a house thats where he celebrate his birthday at it was very small it was the size of the kitchen and he said he will always be grateful to his family for doing so great things for him and thats the time he was very young he was very proud and he said he will be always be to his parents for there love and sacrifice he told his parent that he admired them for there strength and courag and perseverance so it was a very sad life for him and his parents.This is a club banger, trunk hopper   Block rocker, rude boy, top shotter      Ay, this is for my down South trappers   My Midwest slabbers, you dig?.I tried to get her talkin'   She didn't have much to say   She asked me for a map to death row   But I didn't know the way   She had lost a million in the game   One look out the window at the pine trees and the rain   It wasn't her day..On a Tuesday morning we pass in the hallway   But you don't notice   I'm sure you don't even know my name   But I don't care about that      With fake nails, color contacts   Extensions decorating my hair and wearing fake fur   Why am I looking for true love?.Nobody knows   And what do we want from each other?.How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?.Fly as high as the sun..Three!.Yes, I think to myself what a wonderful world."
"The mood in this article is happy and grateful. I think it's happy because Narciso tells you how much fun he has with his parents and close family, and how much Narciso likes living where she lives. I think its grateful because Narciso got the education that he wanted and everyone around him was so proud of Narciso. I feel like the mood is mostely happy and grateful.I Really Thought You Were The One, The Only One   I Guess That I Was Wrong   Then You Turned Out You Wasn't It   The Opposite   Of Everything I Thought, So...

"Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon..Don't be blind you've got a thinking mind..Well give it up to me   You got me boy and I surrender   Lets get you back to my      Over and over you run in my mind   Give me one look and you know I'm fine   Can't you see we're only wasting our time   Baby thought you understood      It's the way you look, me   It's the way you move, me   And the way you touch, me   It's the way you love, me      Baby it's simple to see   Baby it's simple   This is where I'm meant to be   This is where I'm meant to be      You stole a piece of my heart   You stole a piece of my heart baby   You're making me start all over      It's the way you love, me   And the way you move, me      It's the way you love, me   And the way you move, me   And the way you touch, me   It's the way you love, me   And the way you love      Every little thing you do   Everything that you do   You can put me in the mood   You put me in the mood      Now I'm looking straight at you   You're looking at me too   Yeah you know what I want from you!.His hand will guide my throne and rod   And I'll never walk alone   While I walk with God..We'd rather be fine   We're in a sticky situation and you really don't mind..For real?.Shred!!!.Dream lover please be mine   I love you every night   Dream lover where are you?.Jesse rides through the night   Under the Main Street light   Ridin' slow      This ol' town, ain't the same   Now nobody knows his name   Times have changed, still he rides."
"The, mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1 nothing really happens so there is no real feeling. About half way through the @NUM2 paragraph was when the memoir started to get very @CAPS1. It is really @CAPS1 because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It says in paragraph @NUM3 that they are neighborhood was made up of, ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really @CAPS2 that those cultures could be in a friendly neighborhood during those times. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1 when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout the entire memoir..At the same time I'm quick to forget..In 1803 we sailed out to sea   Out from the sweet town of Derry   For Australia bound if we didn't all drown   And the marks of our fetters we carried   In our rusty iron chains we cried for our weans   Our good women we left in sorrow   As the mainsails unfurled, our curses we hurled   On the English, and thoughts of tomorrow      At the mouth of the Foyle, bid farewell to the soil   As down below decks we were lying   O'Doherty screamed, woken out of a dream   By a vision of bold Robert dying   The sun burned cruel as we dished out the gruel   Dan O'Connor was down with a fever   Sixty rebels today bound for Botany Bay   How many will meet their reciever      Chorus   Oh....Put 'em on   Put the big boots on   Baby put them big boots on..Going to see the river man   Going to tell him all I can   About the ban   On feeling free..Would you care to let it show?.En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style      [Chorus]   Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus   Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus   Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus   Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus      Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse   My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse   I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk   Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk   Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'   However, I master the trick just like Nixon   Causin' terror, quick damage ya whole era   Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot   P.L.O..There is no common ground..Baby, baby I want you   Baby, and I need you   I'm still in love with you   Even though you're not with me   You never once left my mind   I guess I'm still in love with you, oh, oh   You seem so unreal to me   Why can't I set you free   Instead I carry you around in my mind   Late at night I try walkin'   Never feel much like talkin'   I'm too busy thinkin' 'bout the good ole' times   Good ole' times      (Still in love) I remember (with you, baby)   I'm still in love with you, yeah, didn't you know it   (Still in love) even a blind man can see it   (With you, baby) yeah (still in love) I'm in love with you   Still in love, in love, in love, in love, with you, baby   Oh, baby, still in love with you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you   Still in love, yeah, with you, baby   My baby, still in love with you, oh   Life ain't worth livin,' no reason to give my love   'Cause I'm still in love with you, yeah   No matter where you go, no place is too far   Just call my name and I'll be there, oh, baby   (Still in love) still in love (with you, baby)   With you, baby (still in love with you)   Oh, yeah, yeah (still in love)      This girl is in love with you   (With you, baby) don't you forget it   (Still in love with you) remember, remember me   (Still in love) don't you forget it, no   (With you, baby) no, no   I'm the one that is in love with you (still in love)   In love, in love (with you) in love, in love   In love, in love, in love, in love, oh   (Still in love) remember me, boy"
" The mood of the author of the story is happy and sad. Happy because he is so grateful to have had parents like he did/does and sad because all of his childhood wasn't great but having a family made it happy and it made it seem more like a home and where his family should be.Both:   I've got you, babe..For anyone here to try to do   Just what it takes to get through to you      So let's all make believe   That we're still friends and we like each other   Let's all make believe   In the end we're gonna need each other      Stradle my hope and make me pray   To a God I've never seen, but who I've betrayed   To the people who live the afterlife   In a place I'll never be 'til I'm crucified      So let's all make believe   We're still friends and we like each other   Let's all make believe   In the end we'll need each other      Let's all make believe   That all mankind's gonna feed our brother   Let's all make believe   That in the end we'll all grow up      So let's all make believe   That we're still friends and we like each other   Let's all make believe   In the end we'll need each other      Let's all make believe   That all mankind's gonna feed our brother   Let's all make believe   That in the end we'll all grow up.Love thyself, well I never could   But it's all right, yes it's all right   I checked out yesterday, well there's nothing left to say   But it's all right, yes it's all right   Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized,   I'm paralyzed   Cold inside, anesthetized, yeah, I'm feelin' otherwise,   I'm paralyzed   Don't see nothin' in my eyes, 'cause man I've been lobotomized,   I'm paralyzed   Cold inside, anesthetized, yeah, I'm feelin' otherwise,   I'm paralyzed.And that's where I'm gonna make my happy home..Don't you want to make him..When I think of all of the things He's doin' for me   It makes me stand in wonder at what He's making me to be   Tryin' to walk through straight but getting turned around   Always makin' my Master take a backseat and wait around   But I praise the Lord for giving me   A brand new start each day   And I praise His blessed name   For guiding me all along the way   If He didn't, I wouldn't even try   Well maybe you can't see a change   You know these things can take time   But now that I've found Jesus   Well He's given me peace of mind   Now every day's just a chance   To grow closer to Him   I may not win all the battles   But it's a victory in Him   So I praise the Lord for giving me   A brand new start each day   And I praise His blessed name   For guiding me all along the way   If He didn't, I would surely die.let?s take on   Tomorrow..The gentle taste of orange   A garden of fruit and flowers is what I embrace   In ocean blue eyes, in each one's an island   I'm stranded within your love   And as I fall deeper than ever   And as we kiss, we're each other's guide into the unknown   Where men do not return, where men do not forget   The sweetest suicide, as if we don't exist but live   The presence of angels, the inscense of Indochine   The quietness of movements, the slowness of Africa   A Point of know return, no way out of here   Nothing compares to you   Anything goes   And as I breathe deeper than ever   I'm coming home, I'm coming home to the unknown   Where men do not return."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love for family. He writes about how his parents and other immigrants moved to @CAPS1.S.A only for a better life of their children. He writes that in a way which could make the reader feel that he is extremely happy. He also talks about how his parents taught him to cook and talked to him about Cuban culture. He was extremely proud and grateful to his parents to teach him all these. The author writes about how this small simple home was very special home to him and also how much it meant to him. Also this house has been this special to him, by spending his childhood there and also how he got love from his parents in this house. This was the house where he was able to learn what the word ""family"" really meant and also how it made him happy about how he would never in his life be able to forget his family. These love and happiness were the the moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family..Mary nodded   Pa rum pum pum pum   The ox and lamb kept time   Pa rum pum pum pum   I played my drum for Him   Pa rum pum pum   I played my best for Him   Pa rum pum pum pum   Rum pum pum pum   Rum pum pum pum   Then He smiled at me   Pa rum pum pum pum   Me and my drum..But I'm learnin', learnin'   How to love you..Put your faith in what you most believe in   Two worlds, one family   Trust your heart   Let fate decide   To guide these lives we see      A paradise untouched by man   Within this world blessed with love   A simple life, they live in peace      Softly tread the sand below your feet now   Two worlds, one family   Trust your heart   Let fate decide   To guide these lives we see      Beneath the shelter of the trees   Only love can enter here   A simple life, they live in peace      Raise your head up   Lift high the load   Take strength from those that need you   Build high the walls   Build strong the beams   A new life is waiting   But danger's no stranger here      No words describe a mother's tears   No words can heal a broken heart   A dream is gone, but where there's hope      Somewhere something is calling for you   Two worlds, one family   Trust your heart   Let fate decide   To guide these lives we see.He's holdin' on to the wheel   To the way she made him feel....A moment's rest was all you needed,   So pack your things and kindly move along..Warm as a mountain sunshine, on the edge of a snowline, in a meadow of Columbine..Always the sounds of love   And a heart never ending   For the colors that bleed and run...one by one      [Chorus:]   Where the water is deep the reflection is wide   We stand on the bridge looking down   But you can't decide   True love will never begin to see   So hold out your hand to me      [Chorus:]"
"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, and happiness. In the memoir the reader expresses the love and gratitude towards his parents. Not only did his parents love him; they quit their jobs and moved across the world just so they could give their son a better life. The authors parents risked so much for their son. The author states that he is very grateful for his parents, and that there is no way to express the love he feels for his parents. This memoir expresses the love, and gratitude in one's family, and how a little bit of caring can go a long way..Did you know she was flirting around   With another young man,   And he's taking her out   When you have to work late?.Posse..He is burning, fire in the twilight..Cruel young lover   Do you hear me?.Henry says, ""Hey, what's the deal?.You and me   We have no faces   Soon our lives they'll be erased   Do you think they will remember?.And who knows if I'm feelin' all right!.Some people ain't no damn good   You can't trust 'em, you can't love em   No good deed goes unpunished   And I don't mind being their whipping boy   I've had that pleasure for years and years   No, no I never was a sinner-tell me what else can I do   Second best is what you get-till you learn to bend this rules   Time respects no person-what you lift up must fall   They're waiting outside-to claim my crumblin' walls      Saw my picture in the paper   Read the news around my face   And now some people   Don't want to treat me the same      When the walls come tumblin' down   When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'   When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down      Some people say I'm obnoxious and lazy   That I'm uneducated and my opinion means nothin'   But I know I'm a real good dancer   Don't need to look over my shoulder to see what I'm after   Everybody's got their problems-ain't no new news here   I'm the same old trouble you've been having for years   Don't confuse the problem with the issue, girl,   'Cause it's perfectly clear      Just a human desire to have you come near   Want to put my arms around you   Feel your breath in my ear   You can bend me, you can break me   But you better stand clear      When the walls come tumblin' down   When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'   When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down"
"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. First, Narciso's parents went through the struggle of coming to @LOCATION2 and starting over. Narciso narrates, ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" His parents came from Cuba to the United States to have a happier future. Narcisos family is nice to everyone and everyone in their neighborhood is nice to them. He explains his parents doings. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents are happy to let anyone into their home. Finally, Narciso is very grateful towards his parents. Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso is very happy about what his parents did for him. The mood of this memoir is happiness..In fact it couldn't be nice   A nice Jewish girl and a bottle of cider   Seven days later I was a man of the world   .......I believe that everything   I'll ever need is here by the roadside..Uh, they call me G H E T T O, nigga   Uh, uh, I'm back on that bullshit   Ha, ha, who could fuck around?.Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   Yeah, oh      Silly you, silly me   To let you in and put a move on me   (Put a move on me)   Never once asked for love   Always took it for what it's worth... A memory      1 But I don't wanna meet on a lonely street   Where the talk is cheap   And the price is sweet   I'm not that girl   I'm not that girl   And you don't wanna see the other side of me   So I'mma hit ya off and I'mma set you free   Before you fall too deep   Don't fall too deep      2 - He don't know   I'm gonna be the one who's gonna let him go   Even if he wants to stay   I'll let him go   Cause all he wants from me is a private show, whoa      He's all talk   He thinks he knows   How this game is supposed to go... For everyone   Still it seems he can't see   Thinks he's just using me, using me      Repeat 1      Repeat 2      He don't know   Maybe if he wasn't such a gigolo, a nasty ho   I would let him stay   Instead I let him go, I let you go   All he wants from me is a private show, whoa      Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   Oh yeah, he don't know      Repeat 2      He don't know   Maybe if he wasn't such a gigolo, I'll let him go   I would let him stay   Instead I let him go, a nasty ho   All he wants from me is a private show, whoa      (He don't know)   He don't know   Let him go   (Even if he wants to stay)   I'll let him go   Cause all he wants from me is a private show, oh      Oh, he don't know, oh, oh   He don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah.Keeps right on fallin'..Am I mad?.Should have stayed away   Another night   And I thought ""Well, well""   Go to another party and hang myself   Gently on the shelf   The death of the teenager   Standing on his own   Why did he bother?.Commonwealth yeah."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This is what happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone. .(x6)      Sound for the people now heart beats faster   Heart beats faster, heart beats faster   Sound for the people now heart beats faster   Heart beats faster, heart beats faster   The house is going on!.There we go racing towards the sun,   Ignoring all the noise,   Striving for the grace of man..[Chorus]      Oh, Tennessee river..Steady staring out the window..What do you want?.Tramp!.And we dance out of time   And everything goes 'round and 'round   And we don't have the time   To watch the world go tumbling down      Go!.I kissed your hand and I came back to life   And all the wrong became all right."
"There are many times in the memoir when author created a mood. One time that the author created a mood was when he described a traditional cuban home. In which the kitchen is the heart of the home. Also when the cuban music mixes with the aromas of the kitchen. This gives off the mood of hunger for great food. Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community. This shows how the author grew up helping people. While being helped in return. This gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people. His family always helped people who were considered family to them. This creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them. Clearly, there are many times when the authour creates a mood for the reader..It hurts me when you cry   When you feel the love is gone   Don't give up on us   When you got so much to believe in   And I beg you please stay   Strangers in the night   A flame that never dies   In a world of lonely faces   You need someone to survive   A heart like yours   Should never live alone      [Chorus:]   Let me be your bodyguard   I can be useful to you   We can just get excited   Stop before we go too far   Let me be your bodyguard   Living in my protection   We can just get ignited   Lost inside   It's only you and me      There's things you shouldn't do   You lose your self control   Should the eyes of a perfect stranger   Take you down to a new sensation   Just turn back to me   Don't wait till its gone   Don't go where you don't belong   In this world of pain and sorrow   Every wish is your command   A heart like yours   Should always find a home      I know the signs and I'm telling you   You're living on borrowed time   But a heart needs love   Like a flower needs rain   Like I'm making you mine      Let me be your bodyguard   I can be useful to you   We can just get excited   Stop before we go too far, my love, my life   Let me be your bodyguard   Living in my protection   We can just get ignited   What we had never known all our lives   I pray its not too late   I would die by your side my love   I'm the life that you save   In this world of pain and sorrow   Every wish is your command   A heart like yours should never live alone      I used to dream of a special one   And now I feel it coming true   But I could'nt let go, I'm a jealous guy   What you're putting me through   I'm begging you      Let me be your bodyguard   I can be useful to you   We can just get excited   Stop before we go too far my love, my life   Let me be your bodyguard   Living in my protection   We can just get ignited   Stop before we go too far      Stop before we go too far my love, my life   Stop before we go too far my love, my life      Let me be your bodyguard   I can be useful to you   We can just get excited   Stop before we go too far my love, my life   Let me be your bodyguard   Living in my protection   We can just get ignited   Stop before we go too far, my love, my life      Let me be your bodyguard   I can be useful to you   We can just get excited   Stop before we go too far.Back through the years   I go wanderin' once again   Back to the seasons of my youth   I recall a box of rags that someone gave us   And how my momma put the rags to use   There were rags of many colors   Every piece was small   And I didn't have a coat   And it was way down in the fall   Momma sewed the rags together   Sewin' every piece with love   She made my coat of many colors   That I was so proud of   As she sewed, she told a story   From the bible, she had read   About a coat of many colors   Joseph wore and then she said   I hope this coat will bring you   Good luck and happiness   And I just couldn't wait to wear it   And momma blessed it with a kiss      My coat of many colors   That my momma made for me   Made only from rags   But I wore it so proudly   Although we had no money   I was rich as I could be   In my coat of many colors   My momma made for me      So with patches on my britches   And holes in both my shoes   In my coat of many colors   I hurried off to school   Just to find the others laughing   And making fun of me   And my coat of many colors   My momma made for me      And oh I couldn't understand it   For I felt I was rich   And I told them of the love   My momma sewed in every stitch   And I told 'em all the story   Momma told me while she sewed   And how my coat of many colors   Was worth more than all their clothes      But they didn't understand it   And I tried to make them see   That one is only poor   Only if they choose to be   Now I know we had no money   But I was rich as I could be   In my coat of many colors   My momma made for me   Made just for me.Mean old Frisco   And that low down Santa Fe..Well, I think you're so wild, girl,   Like the sun in the morning..Sally, it's alright..No, of course not..Till eternity we'll fulfill our desires      We live for love   We live for love   We live for love   We live for love      I never planned to win the race   But you convinced me face to face   There was never a chance of losing at all      We live for love   We live for love   We live for love   We live for love      We live for love   We live for love   We live for love....Skiing down a mountain of beans,   Devising a system for remembering everything,   Or synchronizing submarines, racing chariots,   Taming tiger sharks, constructing a portal to mars,   Building a time machine, stretching a rubber tree, or wailing away on guitars,      This could possibly be the best day ever,   And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be a million and six times better,   So make every minute count to one,   Jump in and seize the day,   And let's make sure that in every single possible way,   Today is Gonna to Be a Great Day!"

"The mood given by the author in the memoir is sweet, loving, and grateful. The author uses many kind, gracious words to describe his family and uses things from what we picture as an ideal family to create an even more colorful image for us to see. He uses imagery and sensory language; which helps us feel I homey atmosphere when we read. In the neighborhood he lived in, ""... all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship,"" and that shows how close everyone was to one another and how rich of cultures that had come together. (Â¶@NUM1 line @NUM1) @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM3, the author explains how grateful he is to his parents which showed him the lessons which became the root of his life. As most children experience through their lives, they are greatly influenced by their parents. To have his parents teachings be the basis of his life, he must have had a deep connection with them. As he talks about his home and that his ... ""parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed..."" them on to him, it shows how observant he is and how caring his parents are to have the time. These words create a very sweet, loving, and gracious mood to the memoir..Time to eat all your words, swallow your pride, open your eyes..I knew all along he was all wrong,   And I knew that he thought I was crazy,   But you know I'm not..But should I tell him about the... Tell him everything, ok I'll tell him      Listen, if she calls you on the phone, and she says,   ""darling, are you all alone?"".The bells are ringing out a little tune for you.Well in fact,   Well I'll look at it this way,   I mean technically our marriage is saved,   Well this calls for a toast,   So pour the champagne, pour the champagne!.This house that I live in has no reason   This house that I sleep in has no purpose   It has a bed and a few old chairs   Three flights up, two flights of stairs   But it has no reason      Then someone shot through the tire swing   The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring   And the ivy that hung now sadly clings   To a dying season      And I cry at night when the lights go out   And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts   From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies   And when the lights go out it's thought to survive      This man holds a hand that shows a tremble   This man that I live in bears his faults   He has a heart and a well worn soul   Ten years a slave to rock and roll   But he has to tremble      For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn   Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn   And just like your love that's come and gone   It goes on breathing.Let's go   Say one, two, three, four   Say oh!.Lordy!"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and being thankful because in the memoir in paragraph @NUM1 when he is saying ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back..Well I double-crossed the woman who was two-timin' me   She gave me one good reason, yeah I gave her what for   Por favor, por favor, por favor, ah por favor""   Por favor, por favor, por favor, ah por favor   Ah por favor, por favor, por favor.Out of the sky the rain comes driving down   Washing away the hills of darkest brown   Heading out through another country town   White lace curtains      Something certainly gets into me   Call it jealousy   And when I'm so far away   Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway      Somewhere inside me   Somewhere above the night   And maybe you've gone your way   And I'll go my way      Somewhere inside me   Somewhere inside the night   Maybe it's dawn   Out of my heart my love comes falling free      Healing the pain that burns you and me   Heading towards another warm country   Smiles are dancing shades entrancingly   Gets into me      Call it fantasy   And when I'm so far away   Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway   Somewhere inside me      Somewhere above the night   And maybe you've gone your way   And I've gone my way   Somewhere inside me      Somewhere inside the night   Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway   Somewhere inside me   Somewhere above the night      And maybe you've gone your way   And I've gone my way   Somewhere inside me   Somewhere inside the night      And maybe it's dawn   In the city where I'll be   Maybe it's dawn   When you're near me.Tell me what you know!.I've got more than I desire, more than I ever dreamed but   There's always a price you pay   It's been an amazing road   I've been blessed I know   At the end of the day, I go home alone      [Chorus:]   I still hope some day I'll have a wife and kids   Smiling faces running to the door when I walk in   Saying daddy's home, you were gone too long   What'd ya bring me, swing me, let me show you what I did   I still dream about that look on a woman's face   That says I love you through the good, the bad, the sunshine or the rain   Sometimes I wish, I had someone to share my life with   Maybe I'll have a wife and kids   Maybe someday      Maybe I could have a son   Play football in the back yard   Or take my daughter fishing   And when she turned fifteen   Teach her how to drive a car   When I grow old and they've all left home   I wanna lay beside my wife   Talk about the old times, remember all the good times      [Chorus]      Sometimes I wish, I had someone to share my life with   Maybe I'll have a wife and kids   Someday      I'll have a wife and kids   Maybe someday.To have a love like that   Must surely be a dream come true..Bump      Baby do you want to bump   Do you do you want to bump   Do you do you want to bump   Do you do you want to bump   B.U.M.P..After this there's no going back, Can you keep a secret ?.Said you'd be coming back this way again maybe?"
"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he develops a very warm, comforting, and happy mood of where he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez tells us of how his parents came to the states and after living in a small, one room apartment for a while were able to move in to a three room apartment where he was born. He speaks of how is home was decorated in the traditional style, about the Cuban music always playing and of how his parents taught him to cook. Rodriguez also tells us of his diverse neighbor hood but of how they all came together in unity. Everyone cared for one other and they helped whoever was a need. If someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others. The memoir depicts that Narciso Rodriguez grew up in the love of his family..Cut those together   Girl that is what you are..Well it's a long, long road when you're out there alone,   No matter what side you're on,   But there's a heart of gold behind the smile   And it brought me to where I belong..Couldn't see tomorrow..Within the prison of my soul   Locked within my troubled mind   Is a love I can't forget   'Cause she's just one of a kind      Just a plain old fashioned girl   The kind a man don't have to tame   When he starts to settle down   He's proud to let her wear his name      Within my hand I hold the key   Do I dare to set her free   Got a feelin' in my mind   That she's just one of a kind      Pulled away from my hometown   Thought I'd leave her love behind   But Mary rode with me   On the highways of my mind      Seen a million pretty girls   Pretty girls aren't hard to find   But she's a rare breed, I'm convinced   Mary's just one of a kind      Within my hand I hold the key   Do I dare to set her free   Got a feelin' in my mind   That she's just one of a kind      Within the prison of my soul   Locked within my troubled mind   Is a love I can't forget   'Cause she's just one of a kind.Ooo, wa, wa, wa, wa, waa!.You getting money?.In the still of the night   As I gaze from my window      In the still of the night   While the world is in slumber   Oh, the times without number   Darling, when I say to you      Do you love me as I love you?.Yeah!"
"The mood created by the author is loving because it talks about how generous and caring his family is. ""... @LOCATION1 graced our kitchen table for meals..."" That quote gives you an idea of how close everybody is ""...family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.""  @CAPS1 around Narciso treats him like family. He learned what family really ment by living in this house during his childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the memoir you can see how Narciso loves his family and friends. Overall the main mood of this memoir is loving..We ballin' in the hod   Money good, get money!!.Oh, moon of Alabama   We now must say good-bye   We've lost our good old momma   And must have dollars, oh you know why!.Know it   And I'm not the type of person be riding around yo block just flashy   Just came to the store to get some black and milds and a lil bit of 93 gas, G   Wanna blast me, get sassy, say negative things about Outkast G   Riding all on a nigga dick, all you had to do was just dap me, come slap me   You the bad man, so go ahead and touch my cheek then   But we'll be burying you and your whole motherfucking family by the weekend   I'm calling your bluff, go'n and buck, I got my squad we trapping   Ac gone slap this nigga, he aint bucking, he just yapping, yea!.[Chorus:]   But I finally found my to you   I finally found my way to you      Now the day is ending and the night begins to fall..I am giving up for you..In two-time's arms with all of your charms, my love..Heartbeat, why do you miss   When my baby kisses me?.Oh, don't give me such a heavy, heavy, heavy load      You may hold some vision of truth, if truth can found in a lie."
"The author creates a simple but peacful and happy mood with the way he describes things. in paragraph @NUM1 he describes his home growing up in great @CAPS1 that makes it feel almost like you are there. also words he used to describe the neiborhood like hardworking, and close knit, help set the mood for the story.

"The mood  that was created by the author is something that not alot of people have. In the selection Narciso shows that he is thankful for being cuban living in the united states. His parents moved to Newark, New Jersey after living in cuba  to give their children a better like. Narciso has ""a love of cooking"" because he was raised with his parents both cooking and having cullinary skills he was passionate of cuban music which ""filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". To Narciso Growing up in his envirenment family had nothing to do with blood relative and, was more as someone who  you think of as to being like family. For Narciso there was no way for him to show the gratitude and generosity that he got in such an early age. And how important he learned that family and friends are..Come on and stay with me for a little while   Hey can't we spend some time together   You look so good to me and I like your style   Come on let's make it last forever   I'm not an ordinary woman   I just want to love you with all my might   You better believe that I'm a good one   And I wanna guarantee I'll treat you right   Come on and stay with me for a little while   Come on and spend some time together   Whatever it takes I'm gonna make you smile   Hey can't we make it last forever   I know that love's a gamble   Puttin' all my lovin' on the line   There ain't a man that I can't handle   Give me your love, and I'll give you mine.Pimps and Hoes..I put this   Moment here..[Hook]   Uh, uh yeah, yeah, oh   Rap's new generation, N-n-next g-gen-gene-generation   Rap's new generation   Rap's new generation, N-n-next g-gen-gene-generation   [Jo Jo Pellegrino]   Well, say hello to the rap Al Capone, south with pone   Tommy gun duck fitted to my mouth is chrome   Don't get it backwards, Stuck Shore South is home   Pelle who, soon to be caked out and blown   Boss of the bosses, Pricehead, Soldier apparel   Read the paper in my bed robe like Tony Soprano   Throw em' all in the bottomless pit   For rockin' bowling shoes, talk about rocks and shit   [Cadillac Tah]   Yo, you bitch niggas is prey, time pay   I leave you shrumped in this five coupe [Errr]   Faggot nigga I slide through   Any hood representin' my set, generation is new   But I wear this tech like a vest   Spit and tear up ya vest   D-A double D for that dough   Hit em' where it hurt most   You niggas ain't comin' close   I run up, gun up, hit you and ya done up, playa you ghost   We killers, Violator, Murderer niggas   [Hook]   [R.C.].'Cause dreamin', baby, that's the way that I like it..'Cause you'll be      Be good to me, be good to me   I need you now more than ever   I'm faithful, me, and when you're down   I'll be around, I'll be your every weather      You know what you do to me   You light up,   Light up the dark and   You're all the good within me   My heart is filled, rebuilt      Be good to me, be good to me   I need you now more than ever   I'm faithful, me, and when you're down   I'll be around, I'll be your every weather      Be good to me, be good to me   I need you now more than ever   I'm faithful, me, and when you're down   I'll be around, I'll be your every weather      Be good to me, be good to me   I need you now more than ever   I'm faithful, me, and when you're down   I'll be around, I'll be your every weather      Be good to me, be good to me   I need you now more than ever.Well I left home just a week before,   And I've never ever kissed a woman before,   But Lola smiled and took me by the hand,   And said, ""Little boy, gonna make you a man."".I saw him standin' there   In the parkin' lot   He asked if I   Came here a lot   And this is how   I responded      [Chorus]   I forgot my name   I forgot my telephone number   If he wanna see me   He don't even know it   I forgot my address   Damsel in distress   I forgot my boyfriend   Was the one who had bought me this rock      I get amnesia   When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou   He's been with me for several years   I know this much is true   Didn't know it was over   'Till you came on over   And told me that you just, just can't   Forget about me      I talk to my girls   I can talk to my girls like crazy   To anyone, I speak my mind   I tell them mother don't phase me   I'm not lazy   But boy, lately   When I see you, I stu-utter   Watch you slip away like butterflies      I saw you standin' there   In the VIP on Friday   We conversate up in my   Fantasies like, every day   But I'm a dud   Whenever you approach   Like yesterday when you just   Came to say hello      [Chorus]      I get amnesia   When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou   He's been with me for several years   I know this much is true   Didn't know it was over   'Till you came on over   And told me that you just, just can't   Forget about me      Me   Me   This is how I do      I talk to most guys   I can talk to most guys like crazy   To anyone, I'll speak my mind   I tell them mother don't phase me   But you shake me   Boy, you make me   St-o-o-o-op and stutter   When we touch, I melt like butter      I saw you standin' there   In the VIP on Saturday   Now that I know you got a   Thing for me, I should be straight   Not the kinda girl who'll just let   Any guy get close   I like him so I'm gon' tell my guy   He should just effin' go      [Chorus]      I get amnesia   When I'm standin' next to you-ou-ou   He's been with me for several years   I know this much is true   Didn't know it was over   'Till you came on over   And told me that you just, just can't   Forget about me      Me   Me   This is how I do"
"The mood is well many different things. But mainly the mood is loving. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the begining and end, Narciso talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in that sentence you can see that both Narciso's mother and father would always welcome people into their house..If your heart's been longing,   You've been afraid to try,   Sorrow's kept you company,   And the dance has passed by,   I'll lift you up and blaze with you   Across the moonlit sky   On the night before christmas..Makes me wonder can we ever stop payin' dues..Please show me   What is love?.Whoa-oh where have all the good girls gone?.How could I ever find it?.Back the fuck away from it and leave it where it lies   How many stabbings can it take before it dies   I got the message like a bullet to the head   No wishful thinking now to help bring back the dead      I never noticed as you turned into a ghost   You couldn't help me when I needed you the most   You made your choice, you would not change your course   I got a lesson how to flog a dying horse      On Easter I got a chocolate rabbit   Biggest one I ever had   You never know 'till you've bitten off their head   If they're hollow and the chocolate's bad.I just want you off my T. V.   Get off my T. V.   O. J..They say the vulture is a bird of prey."
"In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, The @CAPS1 created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was a very soft @CAPS1 because they are all greatfull for what being going on with their lifes like the @CAPS2 said in paragraph @NUM1 ""It was in this simple house tha my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feas (Albeit a frugal Cuban feas) always filled the air with not Just scent an music but life and love. it was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house towards gracious neighborhood or the many things I learne there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn the simple house into a home..Leaving here..Word's on the streets and it's on the news:   I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you..It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now..I don't care!.I love lilacs and avocados   Ukuleles and fireworks   And Woody Allen and walking in the snow   But you've got to know that      You're the love of my life   You are the love of my life   You are the love of my life   You are the love of my life   From the moment I first saw you   The second that you were born   I knew that you were the love of my life   Quite simply the love of my life      I love Lucy and pumpernickel bread   The Statue Of Liberty and standing ovations   And falling into bed   But get it through your head that      You're the love of my life   You are the love of my life   You are the love of my life   You are the love of my life   From the moment I first saw you   The second that you were born   I knew that you were the love of my life   Quite simply the love of my life      You an drive me crazy   You can drive me anywhere   Here are the keys   Just do as you please   It may not always be easy      But you're the love of my life   My heart is riding on a runaway train   You are the love of my life   Through all the pleasure and pain   From the moment I first saw you   I knew it right away   I knew that you were the love of my life   Simply the love of my life   You are the love   The great love of my life..There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind   We weren't meant to be lonely   Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day   There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone   All those desperate mornings   Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind      I suppose there have been times when you felt like a room filled with darkness   Not a window around   There must have been moments you felt you were truly alone   Then again each of us knows, in a night of unbearable sadness   Still a light can be found   In each morning the promise that someday your true love will come      I suppose there are some people who never believe in the magic   Oh the magic of love   They think nothing is precious and life is just pleasure and pain   Then again each of us knows, when a heart has been broken it's tragic   Oh the magic of love   Even that which is broken with love can be mended again      All the things that you fear, at the most they mean nothing   All the sorrow and sadness can just disappear      There was never a doubt, never a doubt in my mind   We weren't meant to be lonely   Never a doubt I knew that I'd find you some day   There was never a doubt, after all of those nights alone   All those desperate mornings   Never a doubt, there was never a doubt in my mind   There was never a doubt in my mind   Never a doubt in my mind.this time, this time..Yeah, baby, you're close!"
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is calm and they are happy. I think this because they talk mainly about the good thing in their childhood. They also say how much they loved thier family. If you don't love or have a family as a child you would not be happ and they were. My last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home. This is why I think the authors mood is happy and calm..Making a living   Making a killing   What's worth forgiving?.I think it's high time you knew,   Whenever I think of you,   My mind blows a fuse..There's a hole in my heart   No one else can fill it   There's a feeling I have   No one can replace   There's a taste in my mouth   No one else can give me   There's a song that I hear   No one can erase   Why would I want them to   I'm still looking back at you   Why would I want them to be you   You'll always be a part of me   What you love can never let you go   You'll always be inside of me   Like a flower you grow   There's a strange melody   Sends me straight to heaven   There's a voice in my head   No one else can hear   There's a prayer that I say   Always brings me closer   To the presence of you   To always have you near   No one can take your place   I'm still looking at your face   No one can take the place of you   You'll always be a part of me   What you love can never let you go   You'll always be inside of me   Like a flower you grow   Like a flower you grow   Why would I want them to   I'm still looking back at you   Why would I want them to be you   You'll always be a part of me   What you love can never let you go   You'll always be inside of me   Like a flower you grow   You'll always be a part of me   What you love can never let you go   You'll always be inside of me   Like a flower you grow   Like a flower you grow.So pray for me..In a manner oh gravissimo, he repeats his serenade,   And his heart beats so fortissimo, when she raises her Venetian shade..Pow!.Written by: myles goodwyn      I read the colors this mornin'   I read the colors today   About a man who left from nowhere to be someone   And every day he has to pay in every way      I met a man from new york city   He spoke of things I've yet to find   A good man driven from his homeland   Tryin' to find some piece of mind      It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train      It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train   It's a fast train.(Hey, lover!)"
"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is gratitude. First, Narciso loved his parents and was very grateful for everything they did. Rodriguez says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@NUM1). Narciso's parents came to the US just for him and he is so grateful. Secondly, he says he has thanked them so many times but he doesn't know how. Rodriguez says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me"" (@NUM1). He is so thankful he doesn't even know how to put it in words @CAPS1, Narciso knows even though they only had a three â€“ room apartment he knew it was special. Narciso states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). His parents couldnt give him much because they didn't have much money but it meant the world to him Clearly, the mood of this passage is gratitude.But I watched it way too long..Sayin' ohhhh-ooh-oh   Fire is burning in every one of us, every one of us.Little white flowers   Will never awaken you..Be my Romeo,   Tell me all about your love,   Tell me all about your pain,   Baited breath and rubber gloves..we're responsible for them..Don't stop until I say when   'Cause your kisses are sweet   An' I don't want the feelin' to end!.Want your bad romance      Rah rah ah-ah-ah!.I need Thee, oh I need Thee   Every hour I need Thee!"
"In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love..Tie a yellow ribbon around your eyes,   Big McFalafel and a side of fries..Jingle bells, jingle bells   Jingle all the way,   Oh what fun it is to ride   In a one-horse open sleigh,   Jingle bells, jingle bells   Jingle all the way,   Oh what fun it is to ride   In a one-horse open sleigh..There's nobody listening   Are you scared of what you don't know?.Taking lives with a smoking pen,   President Kill wants killing again..I think it's safe to say when it comes to truth you're blind      Whatever happened is over now for you..I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man ....[Mrs. Strakosh:]   Find a man--   [Mrs. Brice:]   You got somebody in mind?.Touch me baby   It feels so amazing   And you stimulate me   And you make me want you   More and more      What do I do   What do I say   Does it feel good   To you this way I wanna be   All that you need   Boy what's your fantasy?"
" The mood is a warm happy feeling. in which The home is safe and one of those happy perfect homes. were nothing goes wrong. But it is a careing home with plenty of friends and family for a long time..I can love you... Until the end      Mikee Cojuangco:   What took you so long to make me see...   How lucky I am cause I am free...   Free to do the things I wanna do...      Donna Cruz:   What took you so long to make me feel....In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!.Maybe it was always going to be this way   Maybe I'll look back and understand some day   But now I've got to say   We don't stand a chance   In this wild romance, my tender heart   Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again   With my tender heart..I've got twenty   But who cares?.People you know try to tell you things   Bad things that you don't want to know about   Tell you tomorrow what you did today   Just remember, it's a small town   It's a real small town      She gets tired of all the stupid boys   She can't wait until they're done   She wants a man who can take his time   She wants someone who can make her come   Yeah, can you make me come      You always say you want a simple life   You and me both know that you are a liar   You always say you want a simple life   Hearing you talk just makes me tired   Swim in the heavy water   Buried in the sand      Happy hearts fall from my shaky hands   I can't hide my sexual life      He always says he wants to find a special one   But you watch his head go spinning around   He really wants anyone who'll give it up   He seems to forget he's in a small town   You always say you never fuck around      You say this town is just plain full of liars   Yeah you always say you never fuck around   Hey, hearing you talk just makes me tired   Swimming in the heavy water   Buried in the sand      Happy hearts fall from my stupid hands   I can't hide my sexual life   My sexual life.Chocolate Rain!.Don't you know I mean boys ooo boys!.Let nothing abuse you or come from behind."
"This memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling. When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood-related to you I think of my friends and the people I can count on. They are my family too. He also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home, not without memories, your family, and something or someone that you trust. Lastly, he tells us about how greatful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love. This piece makes me think about and appreciate my family, and my home..As below, so above and beyond, I imagine   Drawn beyond the lines of reason..Real underground baby..That was like a Jay Z drink   Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?.( old things make way for new things,   Yet we still cling to the true things ..How does it feel on your own?.You dirty little fuck..Is nothing sacred anymore?.Why would I try?"
"c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family.

" The author creates a @CAPS1 but happy mood and shows @CAPS1 parts and happy parts in the @CAPS2 about a boy whos parents immigrated. his house was what he grew up in and his parents put a Cuban twist to it..Hey, hey, hey,   (submission)   (don't you want to right it, fight it)   Oh, no, if you don't think it's right   Can't change your mind if I talk all night   (don't you want to right it, fight it)   Oh, no, 'cause nothing now can keep this a good thing..Going for the one..(A-M-E-are-I-C-A)..All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard..Pop!.Oh, my God can do anything (ah) My God can heal the sick (ah) Mend broken hearts and take our souls to heaven (ah) So Satan, listen up (ah) In God's name I rebuke you (ah) I stand up in his name, look you in the eye and laugh in your ugly face (ha, ha, ha) Go to Hell, go to Hell, go back where you belong Get thee behind me Satan, just leave me alone Take your weapons of mass destruction, terror and sleaze Go to Hell with your corruption, just get away from me Go to Hell, go to Hell, go to Hell, go to Hell Go to Hell in a handbasket 'cause heaven waits for me Go to Hell, go to Hell, go to Hell, go to Hell Go to Hell in a handbasket 'cause heaven waits for me Go to Hell in a handbasket, heaven's calling me Heaven, heaven waits for me, so go to Hell Oh, my brothers and my sisters (ah) God can deliver us from Satan's evil grip Satan, listen to me, my Father in Heaven can kick your astronomical ego right back to the pits of Hell (ah) Can I get an amen on that one?.Awkward instant   And the first animal is jettisoned,   Legs furiously pumping   Their stiff green gallop,   And head bob up   Poise   Delicate   Pause   Consent   In mute nostril agony   Carefully refined   And sealed over..And the first people got up   And looked out of their window, they saw a   Great big shadow in front of the sun."
"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our Lives shared his feelings, traditions, and Love he shared with his family growing up.Narciso and his @CAPS1 and dad were cuban. they shared their cuban traditions with eachother and were warm and welcoming with eachother and other people. Narciso's family was generous to other people and shared with everyone. they were all kind to eachother and lived a traditional @CAPS2.Narciso emphasized a mood during the memoir .. The love and meaning of family..Oh baby this is nowhere..I'm getting ready to rock   I'm getting ready to roll now baby   I'm in the mood to dance   I'm in the mood for sweet romance      Take it easy let it go   Sweet emotions start to flow      I'm ready to rock   Ready to rock   Ready to rock      I'm getting ready to move   I'm getting ready to groove now baby   I'm running so hot   I'm getting ready to shoot my shot      Take it easy let it go   Sweet emotions start to flow      I'm ready to rock      I'm going to lose control   Of my heart and soul   If I keep on watching you   And those things you do   It's going to be all right   We're going to dance all night   Anything you want to do   Here it comes      I'm getting ready to rock   I'm getting ready to roll now baby   I'm in the mood to dance   I'm in the mood for sweet romance      Take it easy let it go   Sweet emotions start to flow   Take it easy you will see   Take my hand child come with me      I'm ready to rock   Ready to rock.But we got love..Flashing lights, lights   What do I know?.Just take a walk down lonely street   To heartbreak hotel..This song was first released on the Live at the Sydney Opera House album..And if I could choose a place to die   It would be in your arms..I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars   Who's to run and who's to fight?"
" The mood is a family that tried to move from their home country to start a new life in a new country.Drum solo!.There's someone somewhere who can't go on   Their life is crying, it's all gone wrong   What can I say now to help you through   Except to say that I've been there too?.Figures floating down to lay..Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,   If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door,   Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know,   Oh honey, if you want me to love you,   You've got to give it up or let me go..Ohhh..My day will come, I know someday I'll be the only one..He thinks he is a big man..Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do."
"The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride.I'm gonna get me a boss man, one gonna treat me right,   I work hard in the daytime, sure get drunk at night..[""Just let me listen to that.""].She 24 in the waist and 36 and 38..Drunk tank!!!.V: (???).Taste the Serpent's Kiss.....Do you love me?.If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three   Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me."
"Growing up in this environment in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish..It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota   Got the baking soda let the water boil workers all loyal   Dropped out the twelve'th   'cause my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees   Now I slang keys   Infest my hood with crack, 'cause I'm the mack   Take a nation of millions to hold me back   Too big for my britches, and I got bitches   Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches   Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5   '89s the number, another summer   Police ain't get no dumber   Streets dried up, used to think it would last   But being a king-pin is a thing of the past   They tried to blast me for selling a boulder   Now I got my ass in Minnesota   Got my own crew, it's on brand new      Damn, what can I do?.Alone,   Alone with a heart meant for you..Don't tell me who it is, I never said so..Can't help it      Love's always been my game   Play it how I may   I was made that way   Can't help it      Men cluster to me like moths around a flame   And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame   Falling in love again   Never wanted to      What am I to do?.My bitch got thong, you bitch got drawls   My chick like to swallow, yo chick like to spit   If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch   Hold up, chill out, wait a minute stop   My ginseng, Viagra, and a strawberry pop   See I'm feelin' kinda bold, why don't ya bring a friend   From vagina to the asshole do it again   I want a yucky down misses bout whatever   Yo mama loved a tymer, now you welcome   You OK lil mama and I love that chick   But deep down inside I just love me dick      [Chorus: x4].We could do some nice things like that..Get it nowwhile the getting's good   Get it now, while it's happening   Oh yeah   Won't you tell me   which way to the top?.Get out that wig - I know you   Put on those shiny pointed shoes   We'll have a strange night   Corsage - long gown - all the rest   That ain't what we call dressed   For a strange night      You're gonna lose who you are   We could take it pretty far   Can there ever be any harm      No one will know you   You won't show   Feels wild like we used to   Just tonight that the feeling's right   We'll wear a disguise that won't   Show through      We'll go out in the old red car   You can sit in the bakc seat and play   Your guitar   If the blue lights flash while we're rockin   Don't you worry I'll do the talking   And tell it right      You're gonna lose who you are   We could take it pretty far   Can there ever be any harm      No one will know you   You won't show   Feels wild like we used to   Just tonight that the feeling's right   We'll wear a disguise that won't   Show through      Let's just stop at random places   Just to see the look on their faces   What a strange sight   Put on that wig, I know you   I know what you like to do   Have a strange night"
"In the memoir the authors tone is loving. The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is full of pride for being Cuban. In @LOCATION1 two he states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents ""rich culinary skills and a love of cooking"" passed on to him. Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful. In the very last sentence it is noticeable. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."".But who is the stranger my longing seeks?.Yay though we venture through   The valley of the stars   You and all your

"There is a warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. This mood is portrayed in many ways. One way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about @PERSON1's parents. And how there home is always open or how theres always ton of people at the dinner table. Another way they portrayed this mood is by @PERSON1 stating ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are. This is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1..Well the sky's turning purple   Above the community centre   And I'm sitting in a circle,   Telling my secrets to strangers   And they say I've got a problem   But I don't know that I've got one   'Cause you never know that you've got one   'Til someone comes along and spots one      They say it's the hardest step   But it's the first one of many   And my feet are stuck to the ground   And I can't seem to take any   I could tell them I just came   For the free cup of tea and the biscut   And make my way towards the door   But I don't think I can risk it      'Cause I never wanted to stay,   But the morning came so soon   And we all know the words,   But we just sing them out of tune      'Cause I had my first drink when I was fourteen,   And I knew that I was in trouble   'Cause I woke up the next morning   With my face down in the rubble   And everyone was drinking singles   I pour myself a double,   I just needed a little bit more      And now I'm sitting here with my name badge   And I'm listening to the same sad stories   About their old dads,   Who're making all the same   Bad turning's at their crossroads   And drowning all their sorrows,   Without any lifeguard around      Oh no, I never wanted to stay   But the morning came so soon   And oh, we all know the words   But we just sing them out of tune   And oh, oh no      And the sky's turning dark   So we step out into the car-park   And I see you all same place, same time next week   But before we go our separate ways   There's just one thing I'd like to say is,   Anybody up for a drink.Here I slide again, about to take that ride again..I'll shine up the old brown shoes, put on a brand-new shirt..I been gambling hereabouts for ten good solid years,   If I told you all that went down it would burn off both of your ears..Hats off to all the ones that stood before me   And taught a fool to rhyme..Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be   If I could only whistle      All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth   Two front teeth, two front teeth   Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth   Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas      It seems so long since I could say   Sister Susie, sitting on a thistle?.Liar!!!.Come to your house, you know he don't take long."
" The mood in the story is very happy. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family not just a home..Chorus   In the navy, you can sail the seven seas   In the navy, you can put your mind at ease   In the navy, come on now people, make a stand   In the navy, can't you see we need a hand?.It's a windy night   Of first and main   Of any city   Of a hundred names   Spirits fly high and the sparks fly low      And the cats are all creeping out the back door slow   And the cats are out, gonna harmonize   They're headed for cool street on the main line   And here comes that joe serpentine   The life of a cat can leave you far behind      They're just cats without claws   Never had a good reason   Never had a cause      It's hard to be yourself   When everyone else is around   There's always someone out there   Trying to pull you down      You're sitting on the fence crying out to the moon   The day goes by too fast and the night comes too soon   You bet your life and you sell your soul   Give it all up for beggar's gold   And the hidden city has its own laws   Produces a species cats without claws      They're just cats without claws   Never had a good reason   Never had a cause   Oh, they're just cats without claws   Never had a good reason   Never had a cause      Oh, here they come again   Singing songs in a melody   Do, do, do, do, do      Oh, oh, it's tough life, tough life, tough life   And the streets are full of pain   Specially when it's calling out your name   It's hard on the one who doesn't sacrifice   The things the world has to offer nice   Come inside, spend some time, stay alive   It'll take your heart and it'll steal your mind      Oh, they're just cats without claws   Never had a good reason   Never had a cause   Oh, they're just cats without claws   Never had a good reason   Never had a cause   Oh, oh, oh, oh.Nana-nana nana-nana, Volvo-driving soccer mom,   Nana-nana nana-nana, Volvo-driving soccer mom..(Put your hands up!).Gave birth to the blues!.Went sailing away far out over the bay,   So the clear the track, let the bulgine run,   To my aye rig a jig in the low back car,   Ah he, ha ho, are you most done?.Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin   With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin   Man, this is an insult   I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow   If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo   Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro   Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?.I love making love to you   Duet by cher and greg allman      Aw, feels so fine every time   Ooh, I love making love to you   Anywhere I don't care   Oh, I love making love to you      Oh, the fire in your eyes   Makes my loving temperature rise   And honey sweet ecstasy   Ooh, I love what you're doing to me   Please don't stop   Oh, I think I'm gonna lose control   Honey don't stop   I want you to fill me with your soul      [Chorus:]   Cause there's no lightning and thunder   Any seven wonder mightier   Than what you've got   Keep it up forever   No one does it better, baby   Come and get it while it's hot      Oh, give me more like before   I love making love to you   Makes me feel life is real   Ooh, I love making love to you   Oh, your heart touching mine   Starts the beat of unnatural rhyme   Such a sweet melody   Oh I love what you've given to me      [Chorus:]      Give me more like before   Ooh, I love making love to you   Makes me feel life is real   Ooh, I love making love to you      [Chorus x3]   [Fade]"
"And throughout the memoir there is a constant mood, which is happiness. In the beginning of the memoir, @PERSON1 describes his home, about how it started to how it became a wonderful ""home"". He said it had ""a passionate Cuban music"" and ""amazing aromas of cooking"". Then in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 says that ""he loves his parents for their love and sacrifice""; and he continues saying how grateful he is toward them. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This is the mood expressed in the memoir..Hey you listen body have you got a dime      For a cup of coffe      'cause my body feels a kind a cold      And I hear the boulevard      I now he bered five years old      I used to go wacko with my friends      We'd do any little thing      Just to check in a little cash      All I want is one more freaking dollar      All all I want is one more freaking dollar      And next side they what they need      And all my family we wack like do a rich party      No when we meet at last for one milting stinky trash      Now watch what you're about to give to me      'cause my penns are too short      Help me out I know that you can      Anything is better then nothing      [Chorus:]      Lucky blue came for the money in my pocket      There's always nothing      There but something tells me      Someday i'll be famous      I'll trough andy yeah      [Chorus:]      Hey you listen body...

"In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house..With Mr Soul or King Creole   You gotta go with the man in the band   He'll be your guide   Singing la la la la   But what makes Mr Politic   A lot of words another trick   Turn peace into war   Singing ha ha ha ha      Ooh it's not the way we want it   Not the way at all   Not the way to change our minds   Our backs up against the wall   The boys in the band all live in harmony   For life's a poem   And we can make it rhyme   The boys in the band all live in harmony   Let's get it together before we   Go down, down, down   I don't want to theorise it   Just hope people realise   The simple melody can free your soul   And let you be man what you are   And fly la la la   But every back street slum where   Pushers push and hookers hook   Just won't set you free with ha ha ha ha   Oooh it's not the way we want it   Not the way at all   Not the way to change our minds   Our backs up against the wall   The boys in the band all live in harmony   For life's a poem   And we can make it rhyme   The boys in the band all live in harmony   Let's get it together before we   Go down, down, down   Break   The boys in the band all live in harmony   The boys in the band all live in harmony   Oooh it's not the way we want it   Not the way at all   Not the way to change our minds   Our backs up against the wall   The boys in the band all live in harmony   The boys in the band all live in harmony   The boys in the band all live in harmony   The boys in the band all live in harmony   The boys in the band all live in harmony   The boys in the band all live in harmony.Walk down this road   When the road gets rough   I fall down   I get up   I am what I am   A family man   I am what I am   A family man   Mother, father, brother   Mother, father, brother   Walk down this road   In the cool of the night   Don't know what's wrong   But I do know what's right   I am what I am   A family man   I am what I am   A family man   Mother, father, brother   Mother, father, brother   I am what I am   A family man   I am what I am   A family man   Mother, father, brother   Mother, father, brother.Mother should I trust the government?.(Everybody here)   We got the gear (Crank up right here)   Anyboby care?.""no"" ""okay"")      And if you want to do it...don't you do it against the wall..Don't call me white, don't call me white   Don't call me white, don't call me white   I wasn't brought here, I was born   Circumcised, categorized, allegiance sworn   Does this mean I have to take such shit   For being fair skinned?.It ain't nobody's, ain't nobody's business if I do      Well it ain't nobody's business   It ain't no it ain't nobody's business   You know it ain't nobody's business   Ain't nobody's business what I do   Whoa what I do   You know it ain't nobody's business   Ain't nobody's business if I do.Another Monday morning   Another five day week ahead   Such a lonely weekend   Sleeping in a half filled bed      Got those need-a-man blues   I need a man so bad   Got those need-a-man blues   And it's driving me mad      All the evening people   Dressing up just to get undressed   And me I'm stuck at home   Losing more and gaining less      Got those need-a-man blues   I need a man so bad   Got those need-a-man blues   And it's driving me mad      Emptiness inside   Empty as a glass in my hand   Whisky friend of mine   Help me make it easy without      Got those need-a-man blues   I need a man so bad   Got those need-a-man blues   And it's driving me mad      Baby baby baby   Goes the singer on my hi-fi   Honey honey honey   My reply      Got those need-a-man blues   I need a man so bad   Got those need-a-man blues   And it's driving me mad      Emptiness inside   Empty as a glass in my hand   Whisky friend of mine   Help me make it easy without      Got those need-a-man blues   I need a man so bad   Got those need-a-man blues   And it's driving me mad      Another Monday morning   Another five day week ahead   Such a lonely weekend   Sleeping in a half filled bed      Got those need-a-man blues   I need a man so bad   Got those need-a-man blues   And it's driving me mad"
"Narciso @PERSON1 so proud he was Cuban immigrante and how his parent did so much for him. he realized that (in paragraphy @NUM1) family had nothing to do with being blood relative. And How all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family. How his parent turn a regluar house into home that he loved.

"The mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful. The memoir was all about how Narciso Rodriguez admired his parents courage, selfishness, culture, heritage, strength, and perseverance.  Narciso said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" @CAPS1 also said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up. The memoir focused on how @CAPS1 is so greatful for everything his parents did and sacrificed for him. In conclusion, the mood created by the author of the memoir was happy and greatful..There's a woman in New Orleans   Said to love me she was born   But that was Friday payday   By Sunday she was gone   So I drove on down to Texas   Where I did not do to well   I fell hard for this woman child   Turn you she came from well   Lady Luck help me hold on   Lady Luck help me hold on   To one that I love   Well I had no luck with women   Thought I'd try my hand at cards   So I headed for Nevada   Gonna really take them on   But the way the hands were fallin'   And the way the money goes   You could say it's getting colder   You could say I nearly froze   Lady Luck help me hold on   Lady Luck help me hold on   To one that I love   So I started playing guitar   In a southern boogie band   And the ladies I was meeting   Make you want to buy the farm   Gettin' tired of saving souvenirs   Don't remind me where they're from   And the nights come on like magic   In the morning it's all gone   Lady Luck help me hold on   Lady Luck help me hold on   To one that I love   Lady Luck help me hold on   To one that I love   Lady Luck help me hold on   Lady Luck help me hold on   To one that I love   Lady Luck help me hold on   Lady Luck help me hold on.You came to search and rescue   In love the Father sent You   Broke through the darkest night   You came to seek and save us   You came to liberate us   Jesus, You heard our cry   Jesus, You heard our cry      Where would we be without Your love   We'd still be lost in darkness   Where would we be without Your cross   You made a way to save us   O Your love, O Your love      You are the hope eternal   You are the light of this world   Jesus, our rescuer   We live our lives to thank You   How could we not adore You   Jesus, our rescuer   Jesus, our rescuer      Where would we be without Your love   We'd still be lost in darkness   Where would we be without Your cross   You made a way to save us   O Your love, O Your love      We're safe in the arms of Your embrace   Breathing in Your freedom   Lifting a song of highest praise   And breathing out Your anthem   O Your love, O Your love   Sing it   O Your love, O Your love      We couldn't escape   The sin and the shame   That kept us bound   We couldn't break through   We couldn't reach You   So You reached down      Where would we be without Your love   We'd still be lost in darkness   Where would we be without Your cross   You made a way to save us   O Your love, O Your love      We're safe in the arms of Your embrace   Breathing in Your freedom   Lifting a song of highest praise   And breathing out Your anthem   O Your love, O Your love   Sing it   O Your love, O Your love      O Your love, O Your love   Sing it   O Your love, O Your love   We keep on singing   O Your love, O Your love   Sing it   O Your love, O Your love      Jesus You're the only hope   Jesus, hope for all the world   Jesus You're the only hope   Jesus, hope for all the world   Jesus You're the only hope   There is no other way   Jesus, hope for all the world   Jesus You're the only hope   Jesus, hope for all the world.You can do it!.(Olivia Newton-John)   No matter what you do I'll send you love   No matter what you say   No matter what you do I'll send you love   Starting today   I'm not lost   I'm not scared   I'm not frightened at all   I'm just sad that you're feeling this way   But no matter what you do   I'll send you love anyway   I started out with anger I was mad   I started out afraid   I had to let it go 'cause in your mind   You felt betrayed   You are lost   You are scared   You are frightened I know   And I'm sad that you're feeling this way   But no matter what you do   I'll send you love anyway   I found out   Just what is important   And I found out   Who really loves me   And I found out   That trials like these make us grow   So no matter what you feel I've done to you   Know that my heart was true   If reaping what you sow is real I know   I planted in truth   And I hope you find out   That it's you that you're hurting   It's time that you let it all go   'Cause no matter what you do   I'll send you love 'cause I know   That if I lose it all   I'll survive and I'll show   From the fall I can grow and go on   And I won't live in fear of the changes it makes   'Cause I've learned what it takes to be strong   So no matter what you do   I'll send you love   Oh no matter what you say   Oh no matter what you do   I'll send you love starting today   I'm not lost   I'm not scared   I'm not frightened at all   I surrender myself to my fate   So no matter what you do I'll send you love   Oh no matter what you do I'll send you love   Oh no matter what you do I'll send you love anyway.Then she dances so graceful   And your heart's hard and hateful   And she's naked   But that's just a tease..Look in!.Oh, why can't we be what we want to be?.Yeah, yeah..."

Other people it's a new oppertunitie to meet new people a better job, or go to a better @CAPS2 for your education. I understand it is hard to move from cuba to the united States. Thats across the world not a town over or a street down. But he made a friend and his mom and dad love him very much. They always have food on the table so at lest they dont starve. It was a step down moving to united States going from a good jobs to poopy.

" The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and inviting. The auther made it feel as. if I was really there in his neighbrhood. the auther took the things most people take for grantit and elaberated on them. he made the mood feel real he made the reader that they were a part of the story..How many villages could we save?.Goin' where the wind don't blow so strange,   Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain..(repeat to fade).We better do what's right,   So we don't have to fight,   No more..Re drinking   Baby let me know   You ain?.His world is built 'round discotheques and parties..It was early in the mornin' when they raised the hobo's head   The smile still lingered on his face, but Hobo Bill was dead   There was no mother's longin', to soothe his weary soul   For he was just a railroad bum, who died out in the cold..When you come home, what you gonna do   Oh brother, oh brother."
"The author of the memoir creates a very loving, peaceful, and happy mood in the story. It is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family. This gives the story a very loving mood and shows how they are all there for each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to lif in our warm home."" This sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very greatful. He is always saying how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to @LOCATION1 to create a better life for him. That is the mood of the memoir throughout the whole passage..Make me believe again   In some kind of faith   Help me to see again   Before it's too late   'Cause forever is never   That far away   Make me believe again,   Make me believe again,   I can't pretend,   Make me believe again..She's a mystery to me, she's a mystery girl   She's a mystery girl      In the night of love, words tangled in her hair   Words soon to disappear, a love so sharp it cuts   Like a switchblade to my heart, words tearing me apart      She tears again my bleeding heart   I want to run she's pulling me apart   Fallen angel cries then I just melt away      She's a mystery to me, she's a mystery girl   She's a mystery girl, she's a mystery girl      Haunted by her side the darkness in her eyes   But that so enslaves me, if my love is blind   Then I don't want to see, she's a mystery to me      Night falls, I'm cast beneath her spell   Daylight comes our heaven's torn to hell   Am I left to burn and burn eternally?.Are you taking over   Or are you taking orders?.A cottage for sale..Lionhearts in cathedrals,   Lionhearts at mournings,   Lionhearts in every seed   But they're sown   On the rocks,   On the rocks,   On the rocks,   On the rocks...

"The moode the author has in this memoir is happines. He states that growing up around in the envirnorment gave him a sence of family, he says that here in my house felt lik cuba.

"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the @CAPS1 of Our Lives created a mood that was calming and the author was passionate in what he said and made a happy mood. ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich  culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This quote shows that the mood was cheerful and calm. The mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house. The author made the mood like an instilled enviroement as like he was growing up in ""this environment instilled in me a great sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative..As she leaves, she drops the presents that she won before..It's easy to fool around it's harder to keep the faith   But I wanna settle down no matter what it takes   If I ever break your heart if I ever do you wrong   I hope I never give you 'cause to doubt where you belong   If a million miles were between us   I'd want you to know   If I had to drive all day take that flight   Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight   Don't let it play on your mind   'Cause my devotion is for all time   Some people want it all some only want the fun   But I'm here to let you know that I'm all about the love   Some people let it show some people wait too long   Well I'm gonna tell you now that you're always number one   If a million miles were between us   I'd want you to know   If I had to drive all day take that flight   Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight   Don't let it play on your mind   'Cause my devotion is for all time   Drive all day take that flight   Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight   Don't let it play on your mind   'Cause my devotion is for all time   I got whole day to take that flight   Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight   Don't let it play on your mind   'Cause my devotion is for all time   My devotion is for all time.(Tell me why)   (They say I'm nasty)   I don't need permission, make my own decisions   (Oh)   That's my prerogative   (That's my prerogative).Presents piled high..Ah, you can talk about the pit, barbecue   The band was jumpin', the people too   Ah, mess around   They doin' the mess around   They doin' the mess around,   Everybody doin' the mess around      Ah, everybody was juiced, you can, bet your soul   They did the boogie-woogie, with a steady roll   They mess around   They doin' the mess around   They doin' the mess around,   Everybody doin' the mess around      Now, ah, when I say stop don't you move a peg   When I say go, just ah, shake your leg   And do the mess around   I declare, do the mess around   Yeah do the mess around,   Everybody's doin' the mess around      Now let me have it there boy      Now you got it boy      (Yeah, ah, mess around, go on mess around)   (Mess around, boy)      Now this band's goin' to play from, nine to one   Everybody here's gonna have some fun   Doin' the mess around   Ah, doin' the mess around   They doin' the mess around,   Everybody doin' the mess around      Now you see that girl, with that, diamond ring   She knows how to, shake that thing   Mess around   I declare, she can mess around   Ah, mess around,   Everybody do the mess around.I'm looking straight through   It's so sad   When you're young   To be told   You're having fun      So unplug the jukebox   And do us all a favour   That music's lost its taste   So try another flavour -   'ant music' 'ant music'   'ant music' 'ant music'      Well I'm standing here what do I see?.[Outro]   I'll take you   I'll take you   I'll take you.Have you heard about my baby?"
"While reading Narciso Rodriguez I felt a certain mood. the mood was very serious and grateful. In the memoir Narciso said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. to add, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness. In closing I would like to say Narciso Rodriguez is a very grateful and serious man..I'll only miss her when I think of her   And I'll think of her all the time   Likely I'll spend my days hearing her turn of a phrase   Things I found hard to praise, right now, would seem sublime      And the truth is   I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs   'Cause it's still her laugh my heart hears   Maybe in time, I guess, the longing will grow the slightest bit less      And there will be moments, yes, when it disappears   I'll bet I forget her completely   In about a hundred years   The truth is      I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs   'Cause it's still her laugh my heart hears   Maybe in time, I guess, the longing will grow the slightest bit less   And there will be moments, yes, when it disappears      I'll bet I forget her completely   In about a hundred years..Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem   Mary being great with child had no place to lie down   So Joseph found a stable in which Mary had her child   Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ      Once upon a Christmas in a manger far away   A King was born His palace was a manger filled with hay   His royal robe was swaddling cloth a halo was His crown   Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem      And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last   A savior had been promised now it had come to pass   And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide   Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ      Once upon a Christmas from the Far East wise men came   With gold and myrrh and frankincense to praise the newborn King   And shepherds left their flocks and came to see and worship Him   Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem      And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last   A savior had been promised now it had come to pass   And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide   Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ      Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem.We're the kids in America..A nation planted so concerned with gain   As the seasons come and go greater grows the pain   Far too many feeling the strain   Oh when will there be a harvest for the world?.I am the greatest warrior who has ever lived!.We're going home   Woah, oh oh!.Everywhere you touch the earth, she's sore   Every time you skin her all things weep   Your money mocks us   Restitution, what good can it do?.Yes, I know I'm late gettin' home tonight   Can supper wait, I quess I lost my appetite   Yeah you can fix me a drink, oh anything's okay   Oh, by the way I met a friend of yours today      I was workin' on the other side of town   And comin' home I thought I'd stop and have a round   And in this bar I heard someone speak your name   And that's how I met a friend of yours today      I listened for awhile and I could tell   That that stranger there he knew you much to well   And I introduced myself and you should have seen his face   Oh what a shame I met a friend of yours today      Please don't cry woman 'cause it's much too late for tears   Yeah, I'm sorry too 'cause it hurts after all these years      And ain't it sad a love like ours should end this way   And all because I met a friend of yours today"
" The mood created by the auther is that of the american dream. It is a very happy and successfull theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had simallar stories. In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious.

"The mood of the memoir was him being very thankful of his parents. This is shown when he says ""In reality there is no way to show how greatful of my Family I am. This show that he shows and respect all of his Family..I have to give in..You touch me like I touch myself,   I like you Mademoiselle.... .. Ho..And I'd love to take that string   You've got tied around your finger   Reminding you of everything that's wrong..Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds?.I'm Brandon Henry and I serve the master here      Through a maze of gloomy hallways and candles black   Safe from the storm she followed the man with the shaven head   They went into a room that was like a shrine   Jewellry and dresses too in cabinets made of glass   Portraits on the walls, 18 in all   A strong scent of old perfume, and then there was THE HAIR      Long black lifeless hair.""it's just fun to say."".Tell me, tell me why      Why do people lie to me   Somebody here is lying to me   I just don't know whether to believe them   Whether to give them an account   To form a doubt, don't want to be counted out      Follow your heart babe   Follow your heart yeah   Follow your heart right on   Follow your heart"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez is eternally grateful to have the rich culinary skills and a love for cooking just like his Parents. His very happy he came from such friendly family. The community and @ORGANIZATION1 comes together to help out those who needs a hand. Rodriguez is grateful to his Parents for their love and sacrifice, and he thanks them repeatedly. His Parents have there arms and doors open to those who will do the same for them..I'm a mean, mean woman,   I don't mean no one man, no good..Gigi, am I a fool without a mind   Or have I merely been too blind to realize?.Never know how much I love you   Never know how much I care   When you put your arms around me   I get a fever that's so hard to bear      You give me fever when you kiss me   Fever when you hold me tight   Fever in the morning   Fever all through the night      Everybody's got the fever   That is something you all know   Fever isn't such a new thing   Fever started long ago, that's right      Romeo loved Juliet   Juliet she felt the same   When he put his arms around her   He said, ""Julie, baby, you're my flame""      You give me fever when you kiss me   Fever when you hold me tight   Fever in the morning   Fever all through the night      Captain Smith and Pocahontas   Had a very mad affair   When her daddy tried to kill him   She said, ""Oh Daddy, don't you dare""      He gives me fever when he kisses me   Fever when he holds me tight   Fever, I'm his misses   ""Oh daddy, won't you treat him right""      Now you've listened to my story   Here's the point that I have made   Cats were born to give chicks fever   Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade      They give you fever when you kiss them   Fever if you live and learn   Fever 'til you sizzle   What a lovely way to burn   What a lovely way to burn   What a lovely way to burn.Nothing!.Here is my violence, and here is the excuse..Papa, can you hear me?.Will she sketch the answer later?.Got so much to talk about,   Yeah, we could stay out all night."
"The mood created by the author is very greatfull and thankful. The author shows how greatful and thankful they are in this memoir When they said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their Strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me With their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life.""- In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful..When it started we had high hopes   Now my back's on the line   My back's on the ropes   When it started we were alright   But night makes a fool of us in daylight      Yeah we were dying of frustration   Saying ""Lord lead me not into temptation""   But it's not easy when she turns you on   Since they gone      If you'll only, if you'd only say yes   Whether you will's anybody's guess   God only, God knows I'm trying my best   But I'm just so tired of this loneliness      So, up they picked me by the big toe   I was held from the rooftop, then they let go   There's only screaming   Let the windows, down   As I crawl to the ground      If you'll only, if you'd only say yes   Whether you will's anybody's guess   God, only God knows she won't let me rest   But I'm just so tired of this loneliness   I've become so tired of this loneliness..Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block   (Hey, Rakeem!).I whispered you   Words I thought I'd never say   We played the game   But then we tossed the rules away   Could deny it   Justify it   But we both know we went too far   Oh, I can feel you   And I need you   No matter wherever you are      [Chorus]   I don't want to watch my love come crashing down   But I can't lie to my heart   I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round   But baby I just can't lie to my heart      I have loved you   Longer than you've even known   When you hurt I hurt   I'm your flesh and you're my bone   If I could only   Be two people   Darlin' I swear we'd both be with you   Oh, I know I'm selfish   But I'm helpless   I want you and nothing else will do      [Chorus]      I won't pretend anymore   Been hiding too long   I won't go on like before   I'm not that strong   I can feel it when I'm near you   It's not healthy to need you this way   Try to fight it, get inside it   But this pain is stronger than me and it won't go away      [Chorus].Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine   And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time      Caught in my fears   Blinking back the tears   I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near   And I never drew one response from you   All the while you fell all over girls you never knew   Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine   And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time      Wait for the day   You'll go away   Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay   And life's full of flaws   Who knows the cause?.You tell me there's an angel in your tree   Did he say he'd come to call on me   For things are getting desperate in our home   Living in the parish of the restless folks I know      Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside   Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide   Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps   It's time we put the flame torch to their keep      Burn down the mission   If we're gonna stay alive   Watch the black smoke fly to heaven   See the red flame light the sky      Burn down the mission   Burn it down to stay alive   It's our only chance of living   Take all you need to live inside      Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today   My wife cried when they came to take me away   But what more could I do just to keep her warm   Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls      Bring your family down to the riverside   Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide   Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps   It's time we put the flame torch to their keep      Burn down the mission   If we're gonna stay alive   Watch the black smoke fly to heaven   See the red flame light the sky      Burn down the mission   Burn it down to stay alive   It's our only chance of living   Take all you need to live inside.Oh, a sad little boy..Mr murphy's afraid you'll make a claim if you take a fall..Drunk tank!!!"
"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good..In the latest midnight hour   When the world has gone to sleep   You gotta get up   When doubts begin to rise   And the world is at your feet   You gotta get up      Reach, It's not as bad as it seems   I cleanse in the river for somebody else,   For anyone but myself      I'm not a selfless man   I'm not a man of wealth   If I had all the world,   Probably give it to myself   But the trees begin to walk   And the ground begins to talk   And myself      Reach, It's not as bad as it seems   I cleanse in the river for somebody else,   For anyone but myself      Hold my place   Don't you give up on me   Hold on, hold on      Reach, It's not as bad as it seems   I cleanse in the river for somebody else,   For anyone but myself      Reach, It's not as bad as it seems   I cleanse in the river for somebody else,   For anyone but myself.Here we stand   Like an adam and an eve   Waterfalls   The garden of eden   Two fools in love   So beautiful and strong   The birds in the trees   Are smiling upon them   From the age of the dinosaurs   Cars have run on gasoline   Where, where have they gone?.You've got a famous last name   But you're not to blame   Baby, I see you for who you are      A one-time apple queen   And a one-time tramp   And an old-time movie star      You're a shell picker   Of the pickiest kind   But you always find the ones to keep      And in or out of bed   You keep you're head wide open   'Cause ya don't only dream when you're asleep      Like a child, you remember   But I forget all my dreams      I used to think   That someday I'd relax a little   And be more like you      Then I realized   How silly that thought was   Needed to stand in my own shoes      And from over here   I can see you cry   Don't even try to pretend      'Cause he's hurt you   So many times   Baby, don't go back again      Like a child, you forget   But I remember everything and every sting      And through all the games   We'll both stay the same   As we've always been   Through the fat and thin   Until the end   Until the end.Oh Lord, so many souls to be won,   Oh Lord, this world is falling apart,   Dying for love from a broken heart..Oh, I just don't know where to begin   Love doesn't wait forever   It's now or never   But she keeps 'em hangin' on   You said you're so alone   She says she can't go home without a chaperon      Accidents will happen   They only hit and run   You used to be a victim now you're not the only one   Accidents will happen   They only hit and run   I don't want to hear it cause I know what I've done      There's so many fish in the sea   That only rise up on the sweat and smoke of mercury   But they keep you hangin' on   They say you're so young   Your mind is made up but your mouth is undone      Accidents will happen   They only hit and run   You used to be a victim now you're not the only one   Accidents will happen   They only hit and run   I don't want to hear it cause I know what I've done      It's the damage that we do we never know   It's the words that we don't say that scare me so   There's so many people to see   So many people to hangin' on and add to your collection   But they keep you hangin' on   Until you well hung   Your mouth is make up but your mind is undone      Accidents will happen   They're only hit and run   You used to be a victim now you're not the only one   Accidents will happen   They only hit and run   I don't want to hear it cause I know what it   I know what it   I know what it done   I know (x4).So have little sympathy, on a poor fool like me..(Cuddle up to me so tight)   Cuddle up next to me, baby   You and me all night, alright   Blue light (Light)   Can you turn on a blue light?.He takes all my money   You know I'm through with Buzz   Yes I'm through with Buzz,   All right, oh yeah, uh huh      He's not very funny   You know I'm through with Buzz   Yes I'm through with Buzz,   All right, oh yeah, uh huh      I remember when he stole my girl   Drug her all around the world   You know I'm cool, yes I feel alright   'Cept when I'm in my room and it's late at night      Maybe he's a fairy   You know I'm through with Buzz   Yes I'm through with Buzz   All right, oh yeah, uh huh, all right"
"The author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story. Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1 and try to find new jobs and start new lives. Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir..But baby they just keep turnin' up   And I know you can't look away from you   When you're lookin' in into   [CHORUS]   Isabella's eyes   Shine your light and make your mama smile..In this generation,   In this lovin' time,   In this generation,   We will make the world shine..The lunar landing of the dentist convention   Italian mobster shoots a lobster   Seafood restaurant gets out of hand   A car in the fridge   Or a fridge in the car?.And I see it ain't too many ya'll   That can make 'em dance like I do   (You say you wanna dance, say you wanna get down?).Billy Ray Cyrus)      There's a song that's inside of my soul   It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again   I'm awake and in the infinite cold   But You sing to me over and over and over again      So I lay my head back down   And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours   I pray to be only Yours   I know You're my only hope      You sing to me of the song of the stars   Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again   When it feels like my dreams are so far   You sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again      And I lay my head back down   And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours   I pray to be only Yours   I know You're my only hope      I give You my empathy, I'm giving You all of me   I want Your symphony singing in all that I am   At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back      And I lay my head back down   And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours   I pray to be only Yours, I pray to be only Yours   I know You're my only hope.Tha priest tha book or tha congregation?.Whirlwind you must know he can't leave   Ever since he was young he had known what a man should know   With no hatred inside      Whirlwind take the wife and the child   Find the trail that leads south   To the lands they have given you   The new home for your tribe      Brother of blood   I have heard that the soldiers are two moons away   They come with many guns   And death is waiting for a brave man   Such as you      Goodbye my friend you must be on your way   Down through the canyons we wait and we pray   Goodbye my friend you can linger no more   Gun smoke is rising so run to that war   Beyond the hills the far horizon   In the purple evening sky   You'll find the valley of walhalla   There when you die.Beautiful doom   Wonderful doom   Beautiful doom      Time catches all of us   Surpassing everything   Time catches all of us   Surpassing everything   Time catches all of us   Surpassing everything   Time catches all of us   Surpassing everything   Time catches all of us   Surpassing everything   Time catches all of us   Surpassing everything      Tents pop up cuz the show's in town   And everybody knows what goes around   You're a three ring act, let's hope it suits ya   Your past and your present will determine ya future   No White Witch can save ya, no potion   And six times deeper than the Indian Ocean   Life goes by with a Bang!"
"The mood in the memoir swifts throughout the story.  First is that in the begin Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different.  But that changed when they started having family over and also using there imagination to decorte there house.  Next is that the mood change in the middle of the memoir when they rellized you can have just a good life in @LOCATION1 then you can anywhere else.  Also, by them having there family with them while in @LOCATION1 made there moods more positive.  Lastly the family's mood was negitive when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made there house into a home there mood change immeditly and they were happy in @LOCATION2.  Thats the mood created by the author in the memoir..I got up this morning tried to get off of work   I couldn't even find not one clean shirt   There was no hot water when I jumped in the shower   I know my boss is gonna dock me an hour   The older I get the more I discover   If it ain't one thing it's another      I got the car, I tried to get motivated   Now I'm stuck in the traffic, all I'm doing is waiting   The fool behind me keeps blowin' his horn   I got my top laid back and it's coming up a storm   The older I get the more I discover   If it ain't one thing it's another      Light bill phone bill water and gas   Pay day comes and it goes so fast   There's no way out and I'm telling you brother   If it ain't one thing it's another      I got to the job and I tried to explain   The boss said you won't have to do that again   I called home just to tell her the news   She said bye bye baby I'm leaving you   She took the kids and she's gone to her mother's   If it ain't one thing, it's another      Light bill phone bill water and gas   Pay day comes and it goes so fast   There's no way out and I'm telling you brother   If it ain't one thing it's another   If it ain't one thing it's another.What's up a bright and clear new summer day   Well, Howzat!.Welcome to a billion Arabian Nights..I guess you'll have to blame it on the times..Do you hear me?.Best in the west, that's your name   Makin' love's your claim to fame   Better than the best, oh everyone say   How'd he learn to love that way   You're the best in the west   You're a tough sharp shooter   And you aim to win   And I wish you'd love me now   Like you did then   You're the best in the west   You're the best I've ever had   A naughty boy   And the memory of you fills me with joy   Let's do it again, let's do it again   Best in the west, when you were five   Kissed the girls and made them cry   Better than the best, oh you built your place   Lovin' is a symphony   You're the best in the west   You've been a ladies man with class   Since way back when   And you stand so high above all the men   You're the best in the west   And your lovin' seemed to fell me   From the start   And the fantasy of you is in my heart   Let's do it again, let's do it again   Let's do it again, (Ooh let's do it, baby)   Let's do it again   (The way you do it, baby's good to me yeah)   Well I'm pretty damn good myself   But I must confess   When it comes to makin' love   Baby, your the best in the west   CHORUS:   Best in the west, that's your name   When you gonna love me again   Let's do it again   CHORUS   Better than the best, everyone say   How'd he learn to love that way   Let's do it again   CHORUS   Better than the best and everyone say   How'd he learn to love that way   Best in the west, that's your name   Makin' love's your claim to fame   Let's do it again   Better than the best and everyone say   When you gonna love me again   Let's do it again   Better than the best and everyone say   How'd he learn to love that way   Let's do in again.[Chorus]   It's like chain lightning, this love that I feel..Nobody, no ... nobody."
"In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!.But now I'm older      [Chorus]      Such a quiet secret, it hurt too much trying hard to keep it..If we changed it back again   things would never be....I've heard the creaking of the pearly gates above..Then came you....Now, when I grow up, I want to be like Snoop   Have prestigious women   That's the truth from the beginning   In and out of the flyest hotels      You say your family don't know me   Hold on hommie, that's foremost and promos   Sales, tails, scales and jails   Success before death      No one in my clique fails   As females with the almighty Father lead   Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need   And it ain't no party like this kind,      'Cause you can leave your worries behizzind   But I'ma git back to tha grizzind   Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and   I'm tha DoggFather      [Chorus until fade].Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?.'Cause if you want it all   You've got to lay it all out on the line      I get to make my living   Doing what I love   Every night I give my heart and soul   Sometimes that ain't enough   But brother, if you're like me   Looking down that road   Be careful of that wild wind, son   Sometimes it don't let go      Can you feel it?.But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked   When I stick it even Luke be like, 'Don't stop, get it get it'   I don't wanna be a playa no more   But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for   I don't wanna be a playa no more   But you know Big Pun and Brock still down behind   Who's down to crush tonight   I don't wanna be a playa no more   But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin' for   I don't wanna be a playa no more   But you know Big Pun and Brock still down behind   Who's down to crush tonight?"
" I think the mood in this storie was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage. And learn about all the cooking. He seems to have had a very nice childhood and has always thanked his parents for that. they gave up everything to go to america to raise him and he seens very grateful..Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads, as we make love   We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us..Oh, I've wanted to see you alone for so long..farther down   Ooh, way down low   Ooh, way down low   Ooh, way down low   Ooh, way down low   Feelin?.Said I don't want to be a fool (ever again)   No way, (I mean no more) Never again (Oo, no never)   I can't be a fool, can't be..I ride real slow, no need to speed   Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet   Feds on my trail, but they don't think I know   I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope   Every time I see 'em, look 'em in the eye   Ask me how I know, it's me, suprise!.Chorus   With her hands, she was touching him,   The alpha the omega,   The beginning and the end,   And with her hands   She was holding on to His,   The source of life   Was right there in her hands..Where the doors are opening   With electric arm or piston   In the tube hole it is sliding   Full of moisture, getting on now   With his both hands on the red poles..What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing and what do we think we might see?"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of gratefulness and happiness. The memoir show a pasionate explination of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents Came to the land of @LOCATION1. It shows how happy he is that he can live in @LOCATION1, and lead his own life. He is, and will always be, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life. His gratefulness also affects how his parents raised him, as a Cuban. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is grateful for his family..Paradise yeah, paradise yeah..The whiteness of confusion   Is unfolding from my mind   I stare around in wonder   Have I left my life behind?.Ya know what I am....   She'll be there..Love is so hard to find..Of all the truths and lies   And stories of riders in the sky   They say only the bravest try   Where eagles and angels dare to fly      [Chorus].No such thing as heaven   And I'm the last girl on Earth   So, baby, let's get it on      Cleopatra used to rule   But she got nothing on me now   'Cause I'm the last girl on Earth..You drop us like hot bricks      Artistic freedom."
"The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains were he lived as a child very vividly. from the air mixed with the aromas of cuban food to to cuban music the author still loves today. It seems like he had a good childhood. He says his parent were selfless and took in refugees in their home. It gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad. He make the story very personal with all the family members he explains. His parent, did the very best they could for their family.

"In the memoir what was the mood created by the author.First, I feel that the mood created by the author is both happy and sad. I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. They also struggled both personaly and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. Although they were sad I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was there home and each other because they have there home Just as they like like, like when they were back home. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir..A hungry sound came through the breeze,   So I gave the walls a talking..Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff,   And let a flame burn to glorify Your name..Nobody, nobody   Who has the face like smarty does?.As a child   Tied down!.I'm in the big machine..Shake dreams from your hair   My pretty child, my sweet one..One by one the stars go to bed,   And I step into the spotlight again..Hold me, hold me."
" The mood created by the author is love and @CAPS1. Because the author talks about how growing up was. The author helps babysitting. And the author sounds like a nice person. thats what the author's mood is..Look in my eyes, tell you lies   Then, baby, it's just because I want you to stay      Would I lie to you, would I lie to you   I would do anything that you want me too,   But, would I lie to you..Do ya freeze in the heat?.Yo Yvette, there's a lot of rumors goin' around   They're so bad, baby you might have to skip town   See something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you   All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew   They say you're a man-eater during the full moon   Mascot of the senior boys' locker room   They said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap   Her reputation got bigger, and so did her gap   Cause girl your momma should of taught you better   I'ma sit down and write you a long letter..not sayin'   Not charmed at all   Not sayin'   That you weren't worth   The fall   And I was alone when   I knew it was real   Down the canyon   When I knew I had come      To the line   Through the dawn   To the light   To the turn   When you said      You could drive   All night   Drive all night      So I let crazy   Take a spin   Then I let crazy   Settle in   Kicked off my shoes   Shut reason out   He said ""first let's just   Unzip your religion   Down""      Found that I   I craved at all   Saw me melt   Into your   Native shelter   Where you carved my   Name   Paper tigers scare   And came      Alive   Through the dawn   To the light   To the turn   When you said      You could drive all night   All night   Drive all night      So I let crazy   Take a spin   Then I let crazy   Settle in   Kicked off my shoes   Shut reason out   He said ""first let's just   Unzip your religion   Down""   So I let crazy   Pull me in   Then I let crazy   Take his spin   Kicked off my shoes   Shut reason out   He said ""first let's just unzip   Your religion down""   Heard that you were once   ""temptation's girl""      And as soon   As you have   Rearranged the mess   In your head   He will show up looking   Sane   Perfectly sane   If I know crazy.Don't make me say what you've been thinkin' all along      Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue   I'm about to get up and run      'Cause goodbye's on the tip of my tongue   Tell me there's a reason to stay 'cause I'm about to get up and run   Better think about the words you say   If you don't wanna end up alone      Tell me is there any room for me?.Inception, made it clear,   As I move into the plan...

"The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy..[Jessica Rivera]   ""Hmmm, so you're the one they're talkin' about..In the morning when you rise,   Do you open up your eyes, see what I see?.Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would..Words and music by earl randle and willie mitchell      If the sun   Ain't shinin bright   And the moon the moon the moon   Won't shine for you tonight   If the stars in the sky gone away   And you feel   Feelin real low down today   If life gets hard to understand   And the whole thing is getting out of hand   Come to poppa   Come see your poppa      If you need a pacifier   Call me anytime   I'll try to be your satisfier   If you feel   Like a horse   Blazin' at the bit   Call my number   Anytime night or day   I'll get ya fixed   If life gets hard to understand   If your life is way out of hand   Come to poppa   Come see your poppa.Louie, Louie, me gotta go..Burning down the house..Interpolated in 1966 revival]      [Frank:]   We'll have an old-fashioned wedding   Blessed in the good old-fashioned way      I'll vow to love you forever   You'll vow to love and honor and obey      Somewhere in some little chapel   Someday when orange blossoms bloom      We'll have an old-fashioned wedding   A simple wedding for an old-fashioned bride and groom      [Annie:]   I wanna wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls   A lot of ushers in tailcoats, reporters and photographers      A ceremony by a bishop who will tie the knot and say   ""Do you agree to love and honor?"".How can you tell me that you want me to stay?"
"The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez, creates in this memoir is a very apreciative and thankful tone. In this memoir is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He shows apreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds. At one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done. He tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are..How I love all of   The very simple things of life   (God's good air)   How I love all of   The very simple things of life      Such a little thing   A fumbling politeness   The difference saved me   Wielding a bicycle chain   Why won't you change?.Are you a man now you wear a man's hat?.Oh, May, could you please hold me?.My baby does the hanky panky   My baby does the hanky panky   I said, my baby she does the hanky panky   (Can you tell me what the hanky panky is?).What does it mean?.Where is the key to your kingdom?.Why?.Was that someone you?"
"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez, The mood the author created was loved, because he showed that his parents gave up  what they had from Cuba to come to @LOCATION1 for a better for their children. For example his @CAPS1 worked in a labortory in cuba, and his mom was studying chemical @CAPS2 and they left that to live in Newark, @ORGANIZATION1. And the author discribed how he grew up in a triditional Cuban home and how you could smell the aroma of food, and Passionate Cuban music filled the air. And how he lived in a neighborhood of Spanish, @CAPS3, and Italian Immigrants. And he also discribed how his family always kept their doors open for people who were considered family..I probably been here before,   But it must've been a dream   Moline, you see   All rivers turn green   The Mississippi rises and widens the sea   Moline, it seems that this is for me   You call me Nancy and I live in Moline.[Chorus]   What on earth, what I'm suppose to do   Young girl, so in love with you   What on earth, what I'm suppose to do   What on earth, what I'm suppose to do   What on earth, what I'm suppose to do   Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do      My heart was soakin' and I will be in a young world!.Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane   Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,   And gather it all with a basket of flowers   Then she'll be a true love of mine..They'll take advantage of your gentle style,   But you've got to forgive them, 'cause you're tryin' to live with them..So give us an answer, won't you,   We know what we have to do,   There must be a thousand voices trying to get through..From the brightest star   Comes the blackest hole   You had so much to offer   Why did you offer your soul?.You gave a new meaning to the Leaning Tower of Piza   Where is the life that late I led?.While you're around I don't feel blue."
" The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood that the author was happiness. When example of happiness was that his parents passed on their culinary skills and a love of cooking.  Another example of happiness was that aromas from the kitchen mixed with Cuban music filled the air. The last example was that he grateful for his parents sacrifice and love..You say you need someone to love   But when will you learn   Whatever's done in this world   Is still gonna turn      [Chorus]   Oh, down comes the night, just another forever   How long   How long 'till you see that we're in this together   How long, how long      If you weren't so far away   So far from here   I'd make your tears go away   And make you see clear      Oh, you'd see a night when two hearts would surrender   How long   I don't want you to be the one I remember   How long, how long      Though time goes by in the blink of an eye   It's passed over you   There's no time to hide, won't you stand by my side   I'm asking you, oh      [Chorus]      You say you need someone to love   But when will you learn      You say you need someone to love.We want to be free      Three o'clock roadblock, curfew   And I've got to throw away   Yes, I've got to throw away   Yes, I've got to throw away   My little herb stalk      I, rebel music   I, rebel music      Take my soul and cuss me out   Check my life if I am in doubt   Three o'clock, roadblock   And, hey, Mr. Cop, ain't got no   (What you say down there?).When he tipped it   With poison   Did he even know why?.I got to know, or you could show, me   Silk cotton see-through lace your sexy thong   I got to know, or you could show, me      [Snoop Dogg]   Freak-a-leek, peak peak   Let a nigga sneak a few, peek-a-boo   Let's see what we can do   I'm bout freaking you, and sneaking you   Into a quiet place   So I can look at it face to face   Let me guess, you prefer to wear cotton   I can tell, cause you like squatting   Your last dude, he was so rotten   And now your love is to be gotten   Yeah baby girl I can read your mind   But what I'm really trying to do is ready between your pantylines   I know it seems oh so personal   But I'm just trying to make you feel real comfortable   I know, so, what will it be?.Grown-ups don't understand   Why children love him the most..She said, ""Whoa, you're just a little bit crazed,   You don't know what you're talkin' about."".Let's fall apart together now   Zipping cupid in a body bag well-worn   Next to the mausoleum he was born in   Picking up the pieces of this gory glory of it all   From eve to morn, for eve to mourn      [Chorus]   Have no fear   There are wounds that are not meant to heal   And they sing in venere veritas   Come inside let the fire burn you alive   And sing baby sing   There are wounds that are not meant to heal at all   In venere veritas      Let's fall apart together now..In every place   That we have run to   All that we've begun   With was (t)here to stay      When my days have been clocked   And all the gates   Have been locked   When the way is all blocked   I exit through you   There's only one way out      (Exitin' the shower   I forgot to wash my heart   Now the dust has turned to mud   Since we've been apart   This angel whispered in my ear   As I brushed my teeth   She said   ""Muddy hearts work twice as hard)   And still can barely beat""      There's only one way out   Only one way out      (Exitin' the shower   I forgot to wash my heart   Now the dust is turned to mud   Since we've been apart   This angel whispered in my ear   As I brushed my teeth   She said   ""Muddy hearts work twice as hard)   And still can barely beat""      Only one way   I exit through you      (Exit through you)      One way out"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. Narciso was very thank ful for everything about his life. Narciso said ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrafice."" That stood out to me because he really cared and was thankful for his parents. The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful..Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly..He lives on rice, roast beef and Yorkshire pud   He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man..Or do I try to catch them red-handed?.So c'mon and....Yeah, you're playing with my heart, dear,   I believe you're toying with my affections, honey..Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright?.Oh yeah   I'm gonna be his first and last kiss,   'Cause baby I was born to be his   I was made for loving him   The Fashion of his Love (I love you)      You know that I'd never cheat on a man   'Cause I'm not like that   I'm physically crafted to be   As fitting as McQueen   But when it comes to clothing a man   I'm fashionably just designed to be rad   Oh he's, no words that seem to mean   What I mean, no no, no!.Woah, Doctor!"

"The mood created by the author in the @CAPS1 was both loving and @CAPS2. This was the mood of the story because the author mentioned how his home was filled with a lot of love & how he is grateful for the sacrifice that his parents made for him. (@CAPS3. @NUM1) In his community that was filled with hardworking immigrants came together in great solidarity & friendship. (@CAPS3. @NUM2) The author's parents had come to the country with courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture which he will always be grateful for. (@CAPS3. @NUM3) His home was always filled with life & love. The author said that he would never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things he learned there about how to love. He would never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home....And now you want to marry me   You want to take me down the aisle   You want to throw confetti fingerprints   You know that's not my style      O sure I'd like to marry you   But I can't face the dawn   With any girl who knew me   When my fingerprints were on      Fingerprints, fingerprints   Where are you now my fingerprints?.And sent it to me, ah, ho.Freedom!.Hey, bo diddley, baby,   Hey, bo diddley..Come on and give 'em to me, babe, 'cause I want 'em right now.

"Based on the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author in the memoir could be described in many ways. To begin with, the boy is very so grateful for his parents and adore them so much. And paragraph two it states, ""the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" @CAPS1 more, his parents left the country Cuba to have a better life for there children. In paragraph five it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carreers in the country they love."" @CAPS2, he thanks them and admires their strenght and preserverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.""

One example is in paragraph @NUM1 page @NUM2 it talks about his backround Narciso states ""My parent, originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956..."" The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names. Nex it is paragraph @NUM3 page @NUM2. This sets the mood of him growing up in a new inviorment. For example he States ""Growing up in this new instilled in me a great ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our nieborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a tim when overt racism was the norm of segregation prevailed in the United States."" @CAPS1 is on page @NUM5 paragraph @NUM6. It shows the mood of how he loves his house. For example he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many thing or I learned there about how to love.""

"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is respectful. First of all, Narciso's parents were very courages. When Narciso talks about his parents, he says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). Narciso gives his parents the respect they deserve by describing their actions as ""such courage."" @CAPS1 of all, Narciso's parents wanted their kids to have a better life. When Narciso explains why his parents came to the United States, he says, ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behing their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). When it says ""They came...to give their children a better life"" shows that Narciso's parents love their kids so much, they did what they could to give their kids a better future, which deserves great respect. Finally, Narciso is greatful for what his parents did. When Narciso describes what he feels towards his parents, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM3). When the author says, ""I will always be grateful"" shows that the author is thankful for what his parents did for him and therefore shows respect. All in all, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author is respectful..If you a hater make my gun go (Blocka, blocka, blocka, blow!).Repeat Chorus..Quarter to three..It neve rhad to get so dark..We always pull through   We always pull through   Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother      All of your life you have spent   Burying hurt and regret   But mama, he'll never touch us again      For every time he tried to break you down   Just remember who's still around   It's over, and we're stronger   And we'll never have to go back again      Oh mother, we're stronger   From all of the tears you have shed   Oh mother, don't look back (oh mother don't look back again)   Cause he'll never hurt us again (cause he'll never hurt us again)      So mother, I thank you (and I thank you for everything you've done)   For all that you've done and still do (together we always move on)   You got me, I got you, (you got me, I got you)   Together we always pull through (always pull through)   We always pull through   We always pull through      I love you mom.Well, to me happiness is a hamburger, going to the movies, new clothes..Eurus..I was out last night having a ball   And comin' home, I wasn't thinkin' nothin' at all   And there on the sidewalk what did I see   A little glass slipper starin' back at me   Cinderella (Cinderella)      Well I'm not superstitious but I'm smarter than I seem   And I knew it was love, if you know what I mean   When I saw that slipper it occurred to me   The shoe fit her and she fit me   Cinderella (Cinderella)   Cinderella (Cinderella)      When I find her it will be   A fairy tale for her and me   I will never let her go   Cinderella      Now the other girls hold no fascination for me   I just think of her wherever she may be   I will search my whole life through   'Cause no one else will ever do   Cinderella (Cinderella)   Cinderella (Cinderella)      When I find her it will be   A fairy tale for her and me   I will never let her go   She will give my heart a home   Until that day I'll be alone   With just a slipper and a dream   Cinderella (Cinderella)   Cinderella (Cinderella)   Oo (Cinderella)   Cinderella (Cinderella)"
" A mood for the memoir would be redeaming. It would be a redeaming mood because it talks about strugles like being an immagrent and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her acomplish what she has become today. Since there are tradteties that help the author lead to success it would be a redeaming mood..Can't you just feel the moonshine?.Madam,   Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today..Ball and Chain!.I close my eyes,   Think about the path I took..It's a heartache   And the happiness   That won't let you rest   It's a pleasure      And the pain that comes   When you love someone   You spend so much time   Trying to get it right      Don't ask the reason why   It's a part of life      [Chorus]   Our love can be difficult at times   But it was by design   Our love was difficult at times   But it was by design      It's a laughter   Beyond the tears   That you need to hear   But you know that   You can make it through   When a love is true   It feels like a lonely road   You don't know which way to go   How I want you to know   You are not alone      [Chorus]      Love is difficult   But it's by design   Love is difficult   But it's by design      Love is difficult   But it's by design   Love is difficult   But it's by design      [Repeat Chorus].la la, la la la la! ).Never in my dreams   Did I think   That this   Would happen to me..The voice is very, very close, you like it that way,   and we're feeling rather warm inside."

"The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life. And how important my family is to me. It also allowed to see how full and good his was to. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells. Also, the wonderfull music that played and the people that always came over to visit. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir..      I danced before I had two feet..I was introduced and we both started groovin'..How you living, what?.Cause there's a power inside you   And there's a battle to be won   And every victory has a beginning   The way it always has begun   With the power of one      Yeah yeah yeah yeah      One day, you'll realize it   That one hope is all you need   One dream that we can all share   One dream we all believe      And we will make that sacrifice   Just becasue we know it's right   And we will face the answer that's there inside   We won't run and hide   We're gonna fight the fight      There's a power inside you (inside you)   There's a battle to be won (be won, be won)   Every victory has a beginning   The way it always has begun   With the power of one   With the power of one      Yeah      We'll look inside   We won't run and hide   No, we'll fight the fight      There's a power inside you (can you feel the power,   can you feel it, feel it)   There's a battle to be one (battle to be won)   Every victory has a beginning   The way it always has begun   With the power of one.They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting   the passports brown   The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in   town   Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a   trance   One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in   his pants   And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to   go   As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row      Cinderella, she seems so easy, ""It takes one to know one,""   she smiles   And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style   And in comes Romeo, he's moaning..I really gotta - know!.Moved by will alone..I'm feelin' numb   And she don't believe a word I told her."
"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and self lessness. The of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, ""It was here where I learned the true defonition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The mood for that exerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors. There were many exerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selfless ness, As such, ""They came self lessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love."" This indacates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them. The overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness, struggle, courage, good outcome, and beloved memories..Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,   And let your Daddy lift it..Jotting Joe has left and gone away,   Hey hey hey..Give me a ride, won't you Hurricane?.Forbidden fruit, ring on my finger..Acting on the moment, it's spontaneous..Hey where you goin' Blackeye ?.Why don't you talk to me?.I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration. I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their ""families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. @CAPS1 thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming. loving place that holds so many memories..I see you've been kept   Out of the garden   And I said   Oh, Eve, where is Adam?.Either that or Bucky, fuck Me!!.Why can't you just admit it,   You've had it, you're   Sick of me      You're fed up   With my almighty attitude   Sick of me      Generalize   You've become so desensitized   Sick of me      Loss of breath   I can see that you've had it, you're   Sick of me      Wandering out the door   I am on to you   You're comin' back for more   Am I losing you?.Gotta win it no limit, strong women we are..Count to three, abc..Some people's lives run down like clocks..Oh no   Oh no   Oh no      You never make me stay   So take your weight off of me   I know your every move   So won't you just let me be   I've been here times before   But I was to blind to see   That you seduce every man   This time you won't seduce me      She's saying that's ok   Hey baby do what you please   I have the stuff the you want   I am the thing that you need   She looked me deep in the eyes   She's touchin' me so to start   She says there's no turnin' back   She trapped me in her heart      Dirty Diana, nah   Dirty Diana, nah   Dirty Diana, no   Dirty Diana   Let me be!.But do we want them to materialize   An endangered species?"
"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood is set right from the beginning. The first thing said to Start the mood was, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)"" This shows the author is grateful and happy. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows how the author is very proud. Also lastly the memoir mentions, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again saw how grateful the author is. In this passage the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start..You make me shiver, I feel so tender,   We make a pretty good team   Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving,   You ought to get you some sleep      Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?.'Cause you've got nobody's arms   To wrap your arms around   Are you thinking what you're looking for   Just can't be found   If a part time heart is what you need   What you want now baby   You won't get from me   If sometime love you're looking for   Darlin' don't be knockin' on my door   If you need someone   To stand there beside you   If you want love that's true   I got a heart with your name on it, name on it   I got love I got love I got love for you   I got a heart put your claim on it, claim on it   This heart will, this heart will beat for you   If you want it to   Love is waiting in these arms of mine   If you're looking for a love that's the forever kind   Baby you don't have to look no more   Look in my eyes   If you want somebody you can hold   I'll be the one who'll never let you go   If you want somebody who will stay   I'll be the one who'll never walk away   If you need someone   To stand there beside you   Nothin' less is gonna do   I got a heart with your name on it, name on it   I got love, I got love, I got love for you   I got a heart put your claim on it, claim on it   This heart will, this heart will beat for you   If you want it to   If you want it to   Oh baby   Oh I love to give you love   I got a heart baby   Part time heart is what you need   What you want now baby   You won't get from me   Full time love is on your mind   I got a heart with your name on it, name on it   I got love, I got love, I got love for you   I got a heart put your blame on it, blame on it   This heart will, this heart will beat for you   If you want it to   I got a heart, its got your name on it   I got love, I got love, I got love for you   I got a heart put your blame on it, blame on it   You been I been if you want it now baby   You been I been if you want it now baby   You been I been if you want it now baby   I got love, I got a love   I got a happy, I got a happy   I got a happy.Bow wow wow, honk your horn..Lord, Lord,   They laid him in the ground..Look around you find the ground   Is not so far from where you are   But not too wise   For down below they never grow   They're always tired and charms are hired   From out of their eyes   Never surprise..A hot bowl of soup is waitin'..Let the burning bridges tumble down,   Let the water come and flood the ground,   Burn a hole into this auburn sky,   I only wanna be walking by your side..[Pre-Chorus]   Ooh, said you wanna be good but you couldn't keep your composure   Ooh, said you wanna be good but you're begging me to come over   Ooh, come over   Ooh, saying who's gonna fuck you like me?"
"The mood this memoir created was a warm greatful feeling, with his praising for his parents and saying how much he loves his tiny home in his hometown and how greatful he is for his parent's selflessness..The horizon breaks, where a figure stands   Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command      He's evil and mysterious   People fear his name   He's not here for deliverance, no   He's the Lawmaker      He never speaks, but his task we're told   To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold      He's evil and mysterious   People fear his name   He's not here for deliverance, no   He's the Lawmaker      Silver mountains won't save you from hell   The prince of darkness inside you will dwell   Oh your weakness your past   The Lawmaker comes      He's evil and mysterious   People fear his name   He's not here for deliverance, no   He's the Lawmaker   He's the Lawmaker.He game me my first sextant   And he taught me how to fly..Hold on to what?.I got love on my mind..And it's raining, all over the world   Raining, all over the world   Tonight, the longest night..'cause we know just what we are   And come what may we're unstoppable   'cause we know just what we are   Yeah we know just what we are   Yeah we know just what we are      Feed your head with all the things you need   When you're hungry   Stay in bed and sleep all day as long as it's Sunday   'cause they'll put words into my mouth      They're making me feel so ashamed   Making me taking the blame   Making me cold in the night   Making me question my heart and my soul   And I think that it's not quite right      Hey !.I'm on the road   Hello hello, I'm on my own   Ah y'see everybody's got someone   To lay their troubled lives upon   I'm really glad I've only got my own   Once upon a time, well I had lots of friends   I moved freely through their lives   But two's a couple and, well three's a crowd   I was just left out   Hanging around   I've had as much now as I can take   There ain't no need to stay   S.O.L.O..Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long   But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, but now I know   She has a built in ability   To take everything she sees   And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her."

"Througout the story, Narciso Rodriguez shows examples of how grateful, loved, and unified his family felt with their struggles they had overcame and heritage they were proud of.

He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle with getting jobs underequiped for their abilitie. His parents, he said ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"".

"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes his loving family and creates a appreiative, loving, and homey, comforting mood for the reader. The author thanks his parents for their kind and loving actions. It makes the reader feel admiration towards his parents and the author is trying to create a sense of appreciation and gratitude towards his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains his appreciation for his parents; ""But in reality, there's no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such an early age and demonstration of how Important friends and family really are."" The author is also trying to create a comforting mood. When he explains the atmosphere of his home, he is trying to create a homey mood; ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is comforting and adds to the homey mood. The author is also trying to create a loving mood in the sense that he is explaining the caring acts of his parents. In paragraph @NUM3, the author describes his generous parents, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to... many people... I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3-@NUM1).

"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, several moods such as comfort, sympathy and a sense of family are created by the author. Immediately as I began to read I felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family. I felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends. As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security. However, once you continue reading and get into @CAPS1 @NUM1, the mood darkens. The author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life. I solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family. ""I'll always be grateful to my parents,"" the author writes. ""for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). He explains how much he appreciates the love and care given to him by his family. While reading this memoir, I have felt comforted, sympathetic, and a strong sense of family, as I'm sure the author had too..Said you'd be there for me!.Caroling, caroling, now we go   Christmas bells are ringing   Caroling, caroling thru the snow   Christmas bells are ringing      Joyous voices sweet and clear   Sing the sad of heart to cheer   Ding dong, ding dong   Christmas bells are ringing      Caroling, caroling thru the town   Christmas bells are ringing   Caroling, caroling up and down   Christmas bells are ringing   Mark ye well the song we sing   Gladsome tidings now we bring   Ding dong, ding dong   Christmas bells are ringing!.The High Street shops are boarded up   An' the Terrace it is fenced in   See-through shields are walled across   The way that you came in   But there's no need to get excited   As the lorries bring the bacon in   'Cos the housewives are all singing   Groovy times are here again   They discovered one black Saturday   That mobs don't march they run   So you can excuse the nervous triggerman   Just this once for jumping the gun   As they were picking up the dead   Out of the broken glass   Yes it's Number One, the radio said   Groovy times have come to pass!.Go slit your own throat!.(What do I do?.I was the girl who was on fire   I was the girl who was on fire   Only a bird could get much higher   'Cuz I was the girl who was on fire.Wouldn't you?.Baby give me a chance   May I have this dance   Don't make it the last   Make it the first   Pratically loved, always hated   By jealous ones   Just understand where I'm comin' from      I was the one chosen   I got my own destiny   I need a route to find my life   I just hope my life is 4 you   I just need you next to me   Or atleast for now 'til then listen      Chorus: 2x   When you look into my eyes   Do you see my pain   Our love is blind   Still it can't see through anything      I can't rap I can't think   I'm a ghost in your mind   I had a little 2 much 2 drink   When I'm not with you   I'm with another, what   You thought I was goin' 2   Be stuck on you   I was but you let go   Now we back together   And It just isn't the same   This love has changed      Chorus: 2x   When you look in my eyes   Do you see my pain   Our love is blind   Still can't see through anything"
"The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.We used to south of paradise   That was okay until you put your heart on ice   Walked out the door but you couldn't say goodbye   Hide away and left me lonely   When I asked you why   You wouldn't be precise   Now it's my turn, start taking my advice      It's not the way that you love me   It's not the way that you care      Running down long back alleys   Pouting like a spoiled child   You've been acting so crazy, driving me wild   Your heart is like an elevator   You tell me that's just human nature   I've done all I can, I can't seem to change you      It's not the way that you love me   It's not the way that you care      Oh no, it's not the way   Oh no, it's not the way   Listen mister to what I say   Oh no, it's not the way      Your love is like a nasty habit   I finally got control but I just can't take it   I tried to be cool but I just can't make it   Your heart is like an elevator   You tell me that it's just human nature   I've done all I can, but just can't change you      Oh no, it's not the way   Oh no, it's not the way   Listen mister to what I say   Oh no, it's not the way   Oh no, it's not the way   Listen mister to what I say   Oh no, it's not the way      Love is tough, love is tender   Love will make your heart surrender   Love is sweet, love is kind   Love will always blow your mind      It's not the way that you love me   It's not the way that you care      Oh no, it's not the way   Oh no, it's not the way   Listen mister to what I say   Oh no, it's not the way   Oh no, it's not the way   Listen mister to what I say   Oh no, it's not the way   Oh no, it's not the way   Listen mister to what I say   Oh no, it's not the way   Oh no, it's not the way   Listen mister to what I say..Step outside the bounds and take a   Big look at the times we live in..Fuck you..I can't go to sleep, I can't shut 'em son...[Chorus]      Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooooo)   Everyone is out there on the loose   Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name   But what you get is not quite what you choose      Tell me, how long, how long   Woman will you weep   How long, how long   Rock yourself to sleep      How long, how long (long and drawn out)   Muddy River runs so deep   How long, how long (long and drawn out)   Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep,   Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep,   Be-be-be Bye bye baby, Rock yourself to sleep.You turn a bright spark into a flame      My beats per minute never been the same      Cause you're my lady   I'm your fool   It makes me crazy      When you act so cruel   Come on baby   Lets not fight   We'll go dancing   Everything will be alright      [Chorus]      Cuddle up baby   Move in tight well go   Dancing tomorrow night   It's cold out there   But 'it's warm in bed   They can dance   We'll stay home instead...

"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author was mostly happiness and celebration. The author constantly talks about how his home was a wonderful place and a happy environment to live in. One example was in paragraph @NUM1. It talks about the endless celebrations and countless congregations of family and friends. This is clearly a happy thing to happen. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it talks about the wondrous joining of the different cultures in the neighborhood. It was wonderful because at that time there was much trouble with segragation and racism. It created a happy environment to live in compared to the many other towns with horrible racism and segregation. Finally, in paragraph @NUM3 it talks about how their arms and doors were open to anyone who needed them. This allowed not only them to be happy but for other people to share their happiness with them. In this memoir the mood created by the author is mostly happiness and celebration. .And if your love was not a game, I only have myself to blame..So you lie awake and think about the sorrow,   Does it really still the fears in your mind,   And you try to realise the things you wanted,   But you take it all for granted and now it makes you blind..Listen girl   Just let me talk to you   I just wanna be with you   So why should I play it cool   You and me, We got a chemistry   So I don't need poetry to say what ya mean to me      See I'm not into buying your affections   With a diamond on a necklace   Theres a realer way to do it girl   I don't need to throw you all these lines   Just so you know I know your fine I'm gonna come right out and say it girl      [Chorus]   I love you, I love you   Whats wrong with saying it the easy way   I love you, I love you   Whats wrong with saying it the easy way      Pretty girl I don't wanna play no more   Been there done that before   I've never been so sure   About what I feel   Lets get it on for real   Why should I hold it back   When all I wanna say is that      See I'm not into buying your affections   With a diamond on a necklace   Theres a realer way to do it girl   I spend all the time I have with you   I never treat you bad   Ain't that enough to show you   That you are my world      [Chorus]      Oh I love you, I love you the easy way   I Love you...

"While reading the memoir titled ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez. I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child..One time I saw you in the street   Thought that I would be that kind you want   Ooh babe, you're the best of them all      I'm trying to tell you how much I love you   Oh baby, please let me climb your wall   Ooh baby, you're the best of them all      Then in the dawn I'll be leavin   [? ].Ah don't give in (hang on in there)   I said hang on (hang on in there)      Ah now say tomorrow if you woke up a king   Now tell me just how would you fix everything?.You've called my bluff I'm not so hot,   Now is that love   My assets froze while yours have dropped,   Now is that, is that   It's the cupid cupid cupid disguise   That more or less survived   Now that is love..Once I was young,   But never was naive..I've turned into someone else      I used to believe love conquers all   'Cause that's what I felt when you held me   I thought you'd catch me if I fall   And fill me up when I'm empty      I don't want to see you go   Only want to see you smile   It hurts so much just thinking of   Felt like this for awhile   I can't stand to see you there   We cried we lied, cannot pretend to change the fact   That what we had could make us feel alive again   Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope   Tell me that now is not the end      If you're looking for love   Know that love don't live here anymore   He left with my heart   They both walked through that door, without me   If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else   'Cause I surely can't help you   I'm hurting myself   I've turned into someone else      Love is patient, love is selfless   Love is hopeful, love is kind   Love is jealous, love is selfish   Love is helpless, love is blind      Love is patient, love is selfless   Love is hopeful, love is kind   Love is jealous, love is selfish   Love is helpless, love is blind      Love is patient, love is selfless   Love is hopeful, love is kind   Love is jealous, love is selfish   Love is helpless, love is blind      I've turned into someone else!.Almighty God, my Redeemer   My Hiding Place, my Safe Refuge   No other name like Jesus   No power can stand against You..She turned away, what was she looking at?.Tearing and breaking down   Tearing my heart   Tearing and breaking down   Tearing my heart      (Tearing and breaking down)   (Tearing my heart)   There goes my heart again   (Tearing and breaking down)   (Tearing my heart)   Watch my heart fly away      All the love that I have ever known   Came from the sweetest of hearts   Every time I was looking for love   I found it in you      (Tearing and breaking down)   (Tearing my heart)   There goes my heart again   (Tearing and breaking down)   (Tearing my heart)   Watch my heart fly away      All the tears you found in your eyes   I know that they were mine   All the love you were trying to disguise   I never could desert      (Tearing and breaking down)   (Tearing my heart)   There goes my heart again   (Tearing and breaking down)   (Tearing my heart)   Watch my heart fly away      Saw that look in the eyes and I felt so sorry for myself   I could've cried   Heard you saying goodbye and you know it felt so strange   Cause I know we'd tried      (With all the tearing and breaking down)   (Tearing my heart)   There goes my heart again   (Tearing and breaking down)   (Tearing my heart)   I can watch it fly away      Tearing and breaking down   Tearing my heart   All the tearing and breaking down   (Tearing my heart)   There goes my heart again      Tearing and breaking down   Tearing my heart   Tearing and breaking down   (Tearing my heart)   Watch my heart fly away, fly away, fly again      Tearing and breaking down   Tearing my heart"
"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times..Mary, did you know   Your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?.Which came first, the music or the misery?.How can I love you?.You'll see the honor I have gained   By the wearing of the blue..But, man, that car of yours is so uncool..Stand there where you are   Before you go too far   Before you make a fool out of love   Stop!.De-o fi cumva sa fim vreodata   Loviti de sus de-o soarta stramba   Mai bine muti o viata toata   Decat lipsiti de-a noastra limba..Your dignity, your only sacrifice, slim as your chances of being somebody's wife   They seeing ya butt, booty naked every night, ain't nothing right or wrong!"
"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood to his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home"". Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories..'Cause baby, if that makes you feel good   Hm..Unlimited   Together we're unlimited   Together we'll be the greatest team   There's ever been, Glinda!.Are we starting up and going down?.Old school chevy' faster den a silver bullet..Love comes around   Love comes to save my heart (love comes 'round)      Love comes 'round just in time   Something that's hard to find   Oh kiss me now   You know i want you to      Oh love!.I've been mistreated, I've been abused..[Verse 1]   Never ending symptoms in my head   We lay hollow in the emptiness   I'm too tired to push you from the bed      [Pre-Chorus]   No more fighting, no more fighting   No more fighting for us      [Chorus]   Feel the void in our bed   The space between is deafening   Oh, we don't bend or break it   The space between is deafening   The space between is deafening      [Verse 2]   No one's moving, we lack the courage to   We lay in stalemate, wishing the other would   But we're too tired, we're at the ember's core      [Pre-Chorus]   No more fighting, there's no more fighting   There's no more fighting for us      [Chorus]   Feel the void in our bed   The space between is deafening   Oh, we don't bend or break it   The space between is deafening      [Bridge]   No more fighting, we've given up now   Silence has more than worth   Imagination cures loneliness   When you become a prisoner      [Chorus]   Feel the void in our bed   The space between is deafening   Oh, we don't bend or break it   The space between is deafening.And finally see, the face of Jesus."
"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir..I reached up, touched my shirt,   And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?"".I....Oh, the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird, and she warbles when she flies   But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July..Just as far as you're going   And, Lord knowing, I'll be much obliged      There was a light rain falling   I started recalling how lonesome a man can be   Feeling a chill when over the hill   Came a brand new baby blue Cadillac   Stop on a dime   I threw my guitar in the back, and I climbed inside   Big blue eyes said, ""Hey, boy, don't you want a ride?"".Along deserted avenues   Steam begins to rise   The figures primed and ready   Prepared for quick surprise   He's watchin' for a sign   His life is on the line   Dogs whine in the alleys   Smoke is on the wind   From deep inside its empty shell   A cathedral bell begins to toll   A storm begins to grow      Amidst the upturned burned-out cars   The challengers await   And in their fists clutch iron bars   With which to seal his fate   Across his chest is scabbards rest   The rows of throwing knives   Whose razor points in challenged tests   Have finished many lives      Now facing one another   The stand-off eats at time   Then all at once a silence falls   As the bell ceases its chime   Upon this sign the challengers   With shrieks and cries rush forth   The knives fly out like bullets   Upon their deadly course   Screams of pain and agony   Rent the silent air   Amidst the dying bodies   Blood runs everywhere   The figure stands expressionless   Impassive and alone   Unmoved by this victory   And the seeds of death he's sown      Sworn to avenge   Condemn to Hell   Tempt not the blade   All fear the Sentinel.The brick jail doors that closed behind are cracking   The school boy told the woman in the street   Last night I heard the bells of summer rapping   The word vows of a mother incomplete      The emptiness of summer must begin it   The nagging of the mother of the wild   Convinced me that I had no way to win it   She took it from my hand and then she smiled      The coldness of the closeness of the moonbeam   The walking in the dawn to greet the night   The water and the flower is a bad dream   The stocking drawn reveals the end of sight      It's over 'cause it's older than the midnight   The school boy told the woman on the street   The joining of the weekend, Monday daylight   Will leave the black rose meeting incomplete.You gave me the answer,   I knew right from the start..'cause I wanna love you      Once you've been defeated   Once you've been defined   Once your will is broken down   It's so hard to feel alive      But I believe that somewhere out across the fields   I can see what is false and what is real      You're the one face that holds me in place   I can see you      Can you, can you help me?"

"The mood created by the author in the memoir was mellow because he's talking about his life and his greatfuless to have been raised in @LOCATION1. Also the mood was happy, because he said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" which is him talking about how his parents made @LOCATION1 feel like home.

" The mood that was created by the @CAPS1 is that no matter if your an immigrate or not one you could make friends and have family that you love still with you and could make some friends. Another mood that he talks about is tha his parents and how they love to cook together and are selflessness too..You can close your eyes   And see a picture perfect life   Inside of your mind   Dreaming only of the days ahead   Wanted and wished for more than now   Or the days behind   You waste your time      The picture makes a promise   The flesh lets it be broken   The picture makes a promise   The flesh lets it be broken      You can never think   You can't even stop yourself   Before the words have been spoken   And you've already said   You would give everything   And something for nothing   Everybody thinks you're joking      The picture makes a promise   The flesh lets it be broken   The picture makes a promise   The flesh lets it be broken      You want to be the one   Made over be your own   Before and after   And a supermarket   Beauty in a bottle queen   Who'll one day grace a check-out counter   Magazine front cover   Though the fine print reads      The picture makes a promise   The flesh lets it be broken   The picture makes a promise   The flesh lets it be broken      Lets it be broken   Lets it be broken   Lets it be broken   Lets it be broken   Lets it be broken   Broken   Broken      When your life is never what you wanted   Not even halfway normal   Just tarnished and soiled   When in your reach   A framed and frozen moment   So far from perfection   Not truth or transcendence   Will set you free   Still you don't believe      The picture makes a promise   The flesh lets it be broken   The picture makes a promise   The flesh lets it be broke.I know that inside you're delicate   And, I, I take care of you, you, you   Take care of!.This is the ricochet,   I'll be seeing you again on the ricochet,   Will you show me the pieces next time on the ricochet, (ricochet)   I'll be seeing you again on the ricochet,      There's a problem, there's a ricochet, (ricochet).[Chorus]   After all is said and done,   You know that I would never do you no wrong,   I never lied, never even tried,   Even in famous last words..'Cause my happiest days, I've spent with you..Outside, Rodolfos' friends call him to join them..[Verse 3]   Your empire's built on fighting wars   That's how your income's swollen   Your British things are from abroad   And most are frankly stolen      [Hook]   Whatever next?.'Cause you swore to God that you'd never end up this way."
"The mood created by the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez's mood was a loving, caring, thoughtful feeling which came from his childhood home. In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""A cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote shows how much love and caring the mood is and makes the mood a more loveing and thoughtful feeling In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love."" In This quote I felt the mood which was love and the @CAPS1 inquires it with his word choice. Also in this passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote signify's all three moods loving, caring, and the thoughtfulness of the memoir. It describes how the mood was brought on, how it was and the meanings. The mood to the story is touching with all the warmth of love brought into the house, instead of caring about the possessions with greed..To be without a home   Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone      Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely   But you know you only used to get juiced in it   Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street   And now you're gonna have to get used to it   You say you never compromise   With the mystery tramp, but now you realize   He's not selling any alibis   As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes   And say do you want to make a deal?.Well I can't control the universe   cause I am only a man   And I've been in the papers but they won't tell me who I am   And if you really need a new philosophie   well there's one that makes sense   The one I profess      Chorus:   I say hey whatever   Let your beauty come alive   Let your colour fill the sky   And say hey whatever   Why don't you liberate your mind   Let your colour fill the sky      All the world's in waiting room   And we're standing in line   I found the answer to the question   What makes this time   Oh won't let them change your story   won't let them change your thought   so let the gurus and philophers hit you on?.What the world needs now   Is love, sweet love   It's the only thing   That there's just too little of      [Chorus]   What the world needs now   Is love, sweet love   No not just for some   But for everyone      Lord we don't need another mountain   There are mountains and hillsides   Enough to climb   There are oceans and rivers   Enough to cross   Enough to last   Till the end of time      What the world needs now   Is love, sweet love   No not just for some   But for everyone      Lord we don't need another meadow   There are cornfields and wheatfields   Enough to grow   And there are sunbeams and moonbeams   Enough to shine   So listen, Lord   If you want to know      What the world needs now   Is love, sweet love   It's the only thing   That there's just too little of      [Chorus]      More love, more love   Everybody know that   (the world needs love)   Everybody, Everybody knows that   (this world needs love)   This world, the whole world   (the whole world needs love)   The whole world, the whole world   (more love, more lovin')   There's not enough.Greed   Causing innocent blood to flow   Entire culture lost in the overthrow   They came to see, take whatever they please   Then all they gave back was death and disease      People were left with no choice but to decide   To conform to a system responsible for genocide   Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide      AIDS is killing the entire African nation   And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation   But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination..[Spoken:] its been so long, its been about 100 years and a million dreams since the last time I saw your pretty face..He said that he loved me and he wanted a child,   If he opened his mouth, he was telling you lies..When it came no one was spared..New mother picks up and suckles her son,   Senior citizens wish they were young."
"The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring. ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family. In the mood in this memoir is not just thoughtful or kind or caring, it's the feeling loved and loving that feeling. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family."".And if you're hung up on the memory   Of some other man   When you close your eyes, if it's still him you see   If I can't have you completely   I'll cherish what I can   Oh, that's close enough to love for me..Please don't take your love from me..Yeah, clap your hands      We're having a party   Dancing to the music   Played by the DJ   On the radio   The Cokes are in the icebox   Popcorn's on the table   Me and my baby, yeah   We're out here on the floor, oh yeah      So, Mister, Mr. DJ   Keep those records playing   'Cause I'm having   Such a good time,   Dancing with my baby      Everybody's swinging   Sally's doing that twist now   If you play requests now   I've got a few for you   Play that one called Soul Twist   Play that one called I Know   Don't forget them Mashed Potato   No other songs will do      So, Mister, Mr. DJ   Keep those records playing   'Cause I'm having   Such a good time   Dancing with my baby      Having a party      So, Mister, Mr. DJ   Keep those records playing   'Cause I'm having   Such a good time   Dancing with my baby      Having a party   Everybody's swinging   Dancing to the music   On the radio   Yeah   We're having a party   Everybody's swinging   Dancing to the music   Yeah   On the radio      Bring it way down now   We're having a party   Everybody's swinging   Dancing to the music   On the radio   We're having a party   Everybody's swinging   Dancing to the music   Where is it   On the radio   Just two more times   We're having a party   Everybody's swinging   Dancing to the music   On the radio   We're having a party   Everybody's swinging   Dancing to the music   On the radio   Yeah, yeah, oh oh.You don't want me back..Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright..Tell me how far you want to go   do you want to see him on the floor - ""Yes""   do you want him to kneel before you   do you want him to beg for mercy      Thoughts of vengeance whipped from humility   you don't see or hear anything   your sick feelings   don't give him a chance   your rage does not want to die   and only that keeps you alive      You can, you want and will never forgive   and you condemn his life   you drift in the insanity from   excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,   you were born to hate      ""My rage does not want to die""   ""My rage does not want to die""   ""my rage will never die""      You ram your hatred like a stone   into him ""Ramming stone"" -   you have pursued, hunted, and cursed him   and he has taken his heels, crawling      You can, you want and will never forgive   and you condemn his life   you drift in the insanity from   excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,   you were born to hate      ""My rage does not want to die""   ""My rage does not want to die""   ""my rage will never die""      You can, you want and will never forgive   and you condemn his life   you drift in the insanity from   excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,   you were born to hate      ""My rage does not want to die""   ""My rage does not want to die""   ""my rage will never die""      (Till's parts are in "").Johnny came home broken hearted   Said he lost his girl   He burrowed up all the hurt in his heart   But still a hole in the wall of his world   Now Betty she was a blond haired beauty   With an eye for a man who could spend   She stole his heart in a pick up truck   Then drove off in a Mercedes van   And he said      [Chorus]   Oh she looked so innocent   Talkin' 'bout bein' just friends   Oh and it don't make a bit of since   Ain't that the way tit always ends?.Why am I forgotten, by the girl I love, because my clothes hang on me like a sack."

"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. An example of where this mood is shown is this quote from the memoir, ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is talking about how everybody in his neighborhood acted as one large family, even though people were of very different nationalities. It shows that the author had a very loving community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood. Another example is when the author states ""...I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the love he feels for his parents, his house and all the residents in the neighborhood. A third and final example of the loving mood within the memoir is when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he loves his parents for giving him oppurtunities, even when it @MONTH1 have cost them something they loved. The author created a loving mood in the memoir because that was how he remembered his childhood; Filled with love..You know I would have loved you anyway..Going down the road with a friend or two   Ain't nothing in the world, in the world I can't do   You thought you'd seen it all, you ain't seen nothing new   Ain't nothing in the world, in the world I can't do      I can really rock, I'm a rock 'n' roller   And I can't control myself      Big city, big lights can see it up ahead   No one can stop me, I'm driving in your head   Make a name for myself and I'll be number one   And I'll turn around and turn around and know that I', the one      I can really rock, I'm a rock 'n' roller   And I can't control myself   I can really rock, really rock 'n' roll   And I can't control myself      I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band   I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man   I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band   I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man, yes, I am      I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band   I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man   I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band   I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man, yes, I am      I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band   I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man   I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band   I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man, yes, I am.This is a Christmas Lullaby   To steal softly into dreaming   A simple Christmas lullaby   I sing to you each passing year   The world is wrapped in joy and wonder in silent mystery   And in this spell that we are under   Blessing surround our hearts completely   This is a Christmas Lullaby   For someone lovely as snow falling   I sing your Christmas Lullaby   To cradle you with all our love   Let peace on earth be yours tonight   Under the star that shines so bright   The world is wrapped in joy and wonder   In Silent mystery   And in this spell that we are under   Blessing surround our hearts completely   Now close your eyes and as you sigh   Make up a Christmas wish to dream on   And like the moon that shines on high   Send out your wish to that star in the sky   Blessed by this Christmas lullaby.........!.Good and bad   I swear I've had them both, they're overrated   But is it fun   When you get hold of one   Some gone bad   And some gone back   Good ones all get taken I'm callin' bluff   You ain't strong enough      Wait and pray you'll pick on me   the day I raise my hand   Guess that I've been nice but I'll be damned      Halo   God only knows   Right behind me everywhere I go   Halo   God only knows   Right behind me everywhere I go      Say your prayers when you get scared   Pray you're gonna make it   And then when you're done   You keep fucking up   One day soon I'll disappear   And if you'll come I'll take you somewhere to go   To keep from growing old      Wait and pray you'll pick on me   the day I raise my hand   Guess that I've been nice but I'll be damned      Halo   God only knows   Right behind me everywhere I go   Halo   God only knows   Right behind me everywhere I go   Oh, oh, oh      Disappear, the light is fading   Disappear, outside their rage   Disappear, I'm tired of waiting   Disappear before we get away      Halo   God only knows   Right behind me everywhere I go   Halo   God only knows   Right behind me everywhere I go   oh, oh oh.The world's sweetest lady   Live around my way   And I think that I'm in love   Hey there sweet one   You don't know what you've done   I was once so lonely   Now I only think of love, of love sweet love   And you're the sweetest one      [Chorus I:]   (The sweetest one) I've ever known   (Sugar and honey) You're the one   (You are the one) The sweetest love   (The sweetest one and only)      Said I'm in love forever   With the sweetest lady   And I know she love me too      Hey there sweetness   Girl, believe me you're the best   You are quite amazing   I'll forever stay in love, in love sweet love   'Cause you're the sweetest one      [Chorus II:]   (The sweetest one) I have known   (I've ever known) Everyone   (Everyone) Says it's love   (Says we belong together) Yeah   (The sweetest one) The sweetest love   (Sugar and honey) You're the one   (You are the one) And I'm in love   (The sweetest one and only) Yeah      Hey there sweetie pie   People never ask me why   'Cause it's so easy to see   Why I'm so sweetly in love, in love sweet love   And you're the sweetest one.Come on monsters, you don't have to cry, (we don't)   We can be happy!.I, why do I bother, when you're not the one for me?.You know what's coming next."
" The mood in this story is sad because the person leaves cuba and someone in the family dies. But the person has big dreams and becomes a fashion designor.That was the day that I felt my heart breaking,   Ain't it funny, after all I've survived..I can't make you overstand, rising up in a hip-hop stance..You're so full of life   What do you want with mine?.With the whole world right at my feet..(Little nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)   I got friends with money, and I got money too   So we put it together and let you pick what to do   And then we do that!.I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn   The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in   A female walked up to me and said, ""Latifah bust a line""   I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time      I said, ""If you really want to do this we can do this fine'   Take six paces and begin to rhyme""   As soon as attempted to make a sound   I ate her up with the verb broke her down with the noun      'Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me   I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow   I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings      Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing   Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them   Rhyme thieves, biters, and bums   Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight   I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?).Your punk ass never heard of me   I never did nothin' to your family   Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly   You wanna take the life God handed to me   Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan to me   Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me   That's an animal,   A fucking cannibal   I'm Duranimo and Hannibal   We international Gangsta bull   I'm bull and Barcelona, with a Corona   You a fake ass nigga, where's ya owner?.And who gave you the right to shake my family?"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. @PERSON1 is greatul for many reasons. Some things he is greatful for is his parents his home his culture and his family. I say this because he mentioned these topics alot in the memoir. One reason he is greatful is for his parents culinary skills, As said in the memoir ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"".  Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is greatful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". The next reason @PERSON1 is greatful for his family because they are always there for him that is the reason his parents always keeps the door open to family. @PERSON1 is greatful for life and love. It was there when he learned the real definition of family, and this is why he would never forget the place he called home..Promise I'll be here forever I swear..And you really got a hold on me   (Fab!.She' so on fire   She's my desire..Once I was young yesterday   Perhaps danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps   Once I was young but never was naive   I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve   And now I know I was naive      I didn't know what time it was then I met you   Oh, what a lovely time it was how sublime it was too   I didn't know what day it was you held my hand   Warm like the month of May it was and I'll say it was grand      Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone   Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice   Say I'm all your own      I didn't know what year it was, life was no prize   I wanted love and here it was, shining out of your eyes   I'm wise and I know what time it is now      I didn't know what time it was then I met you   Oh, what a lovely time it was how sublime it was too   I didn't know what day it was you held my hand   Warm like the month of May it was and I'll say it was grand      Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone   Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice   Say I'm all your own      I didn't know what year it was, life was no prize   I wanted love and here it was, shining out of your eyes   I'm wise and I know what time it is now.Why that?.That may be all I need to know..Sail on my brother   Sail on through the night   Sail on my sister   Sail on through the night      Beautiful as the day is long   Beautiful as the day is long      Sail on your troubles   Sail on through your doubts   Sail on your worries   Sail on soon you'll work it out      Beautiful as the day is long   Beautiful as the day is long      I've always been a believer   In the good things of life   But they don't all come wrapped in cellophane   And they don't always seem to turn out right   They don't always seen to turn out right      I've always been a believer   In the good things of life   But they don't all come wrapped in cellophane   And they don't always seem to turn out right   No, no, no,   They don't always seen to turn out right   Sometimes they do not   Humm.... sail on.I'm gonna hypnotize you   Are you ready for me?"
"Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set!.How can I go on but nothing's changed   You and I both know the choice was made   When I first touched you   Now if I stay or leave it's all the same   Awake or in my dreams I see your face   I will love you      I'm always in control now here I stand   A heart is in my hand      I can't stay, I can't leave   I'm torn between two people I need   One of them is you, the other is me   We come from different world, different stars   But when you're lying here in my arms   All I wanna do is love the way you do   All I wanna do is love the way you do..Duck and Sally inside   They're cooking for the down five   Who're staring at Miss Rayon   Who's busy licking up her pig pen   I'm searching for my mainline   I said I couldn't hit it sideways   I said I couldn't hit it sideways   Oh, just like Sister Ray said   Live it on      Rosey and Miss Rayon   They're busy waiting for her booster   Who just got back from Carolina   She said she didn't like the weather   They're busy waiting for her sailor   Who says he's just as big as ever   He says he's from Alabama   He wants to know a way to earn a dollar   I'm searching for my mainline   I said I couldn't hit it sideways   I couldn't hit it sideways   Oh, just like Sister Ray said   Play on      Cecil's got his new piece   He cocks and shoots between three and four   He aims it at the sailor   Shoots him down dead on the floor   Oh, you shouldn't do that   Don't you know, you'll stain the carpet?.Hobo - I'm hobophobic So what ah ah ah   Scared of bums   Not just because they stink bad   Not just because they're crackers   From drinking too much lysol      Let them be   Just don't get fuckin' near me   Scared of bums ah ah ah      Infested with microscopic bugs   Endocrine systematic doo doo   Why don't they get a job      Let them be   Just don't get fuckin' near me   Scared of bums ah ah ah.Such a little thing   A gentle tone of kindness   Or written words on paper   Can you write?.All over the world the rain was pourin'   I was scratchin' where it itched   Oh heartbreak and despair got nothing but boring   So I grabbed you baby like a wild pitch      It takes a leap of faith to get things going   It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts   It takes a leap of faith to get things going   In your heart you must trust      Now your legs were heaven your breasts were the altar   Your body was the holy land   You shouted ""jump"" but my heart faltered   You laughed and said ""Baby don't you understand?"".Cover your ears so you won't disappear..Move it move it baby   Can't you see I'm ready to dance?.Your mother loves her brother   But her brother loves his lover   And his lover is my cover   My one and only other - my angel      My angel Trilby   Who said I will be   What I should still be   Genius would fill me - she loves Hymie      Only one Hymie   No one else on earth could ever blind me - like this   Or even find me - such bliss   If you were gone   You'd still be here      Only one Hymie   Why can't they see that life excites me   This boy ignites me   His family fights me   But he's still here      Only one Hymie..."
"The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"". By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading..I wonder if she wonders, if this is all for real,   I couldn't stand to see her cry because of me, that would be sad..If you don't want to boil as well..I want to walk you up Lavender Hill..We're caught in a trap,   I can't walk out x6.Just cruisin' slow through the dark of night..When you stay out late at night   You never ask me how I feel, you just say that I'm uptight   When you're down, I do for you   And now I find that you're untrue.Get up, get up, get up!.I love my dog, baby, I love my dog."
"The mood created by the author in this memoir is happiness. According to the last sentence were @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. This means that the mood is very happy and that this mood is great. @PERSON1 has many memories of the home that are positive and he also learned from what his parents taugh him. This mood in this memoir is a very positive and happy mood because the passage is about good memories and bonds between friends and family. Such as, when they first moved from cuba to the unided states to start their lifes new..Well she looked at me, and a I, I could see   That before too long I'd fall in love with her..[Verse 1:]   Traveling down on different roads   Trying hard to leave the load   We take it there but we can't let go   It's so hard to lay it down      [Verse 2:]   Back in Eden we were tried   Found ourselves dissatisfied   Seeking wisdom that she denied   Trying hard to lay it down      [Chorus:]   Lay it down brother,lay it down   It's so hard to lay it down      [Verse 3:]   Hide in me,confide in me   Don't you think it's time to be   Everything we tried to be   You and me sould lay it down      [Verse 4:]   Speak to me,be unashamed   There's no need in playing games   After all we're all the same   Just trying hard to lay it down      [Chorus.].Share your loving and you live so long..Outside the summer's gone for good..Should I go back to sleep?.Drizzle from the night left cold puddles out..Baby only you      I cry my eyes out baby   wondering what I have to do..If God   If God is a DJ (life is a dance floor)   Get your ass on the dance floor      [CHORUS (2X):]   If God is a DJ   Life is a dance floor   Love is the rhythm   You are the music   If God is a DJ   Life is a dance floor   You get what you're given   It's all how you use it"
"The mood created by the @CAPS1 is a very good and happy mood. You can tell by how he is always talk about both happy, family, and his cuba harrtage and works, music..There's a river running under your feet,   Under this house, under this street..It was your own decision,   You made my life a mission..low   You say it was this mornin?.Forget this hunger inside   Forget this hunger inside   Should I let the feeling flow?.The flavor of life   Wasurekakete ita hito no kaori wo totsuzen omoidasu koro   Furitsumoru yuki no shirosa wo omou to sunao ni yorokobitai yo   Daiyamondo yorimo yawarakakute atatakana mirai   Teni shitai yo kagiri aru jikan wo kimi to sugoshitai   ""arigatou"" to kimi ni iwareru to nandaka setsunai   Sayounara no ato no tokenu mahou awaku horonigai   The flavor of life.Etc!.I know you love   Come on to my house   Aah....Beggin' a dollar, stealin' a dime,   Come on can't you see that I   I am stranded ,caught in the crossfire   I am stranded, caught in the crossfire."
"I think the mood that this author is creating is love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS2 of the mood is that they took their cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big @CAPS2. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall @CAPS3 in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination..When you feel like it you just do it you never move around it you walk   Through it well you don't give a damn where it comes from 'cause   Everybody gonna have to chew your junk well does it feel right?.[Pre-Chorus]   Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart   No I'm not gonna do it standing up   The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me   Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights      [Chorus]   Lay me down ('til the morning)   Lay me down (through the night)   Lay me down (I can fall in)   Lay me down (Won't you)   Lay me down (I can baby)   Lay me down (Someone believe me)      [Bridge]   Lay down with me   Lay down with me   Lay down with me   Lay down with me      [Pre-Chorus]   Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me   Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights      [Chorus]   Lay me down ('til the morning)   Lay me down (through the night)   Lay me down (I can fall in)   Lay me down (Won't you)   Lay me down (I can baby)   Lay me down (Someone believe me).When you know love   You can know no fear..When they look in your eye   When they look in your eyes   Lovers they know when they look in your eyes.I hope you're enjoyin' the scenery,   I know that it's pretty up there..My dear sir, I'm Emperor Of Lancashire      Now I'm going back to my native town, with my millions I'll knock 'em down   I'll have everything in my power and I'll build a palace on the Blackpool tower   On my birthday the crowds will cheer, all the fountains will flow with beer..Brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la   There's a brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la la   Brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la   She looks like a sugar in a plum   Plum plum      Show me your motion   Tra la la la la   Come on show me your motion   Tra la la la la la   Show me your motion   Tra la la la la   She looks like a sugar in a plum   Plum plum      Old headwater run dry   Got nowhere to wash my clothes   Old headwater run dry   Got nowhere to wash my clothes      I remember one Saturday night   We had fried fish and Johnny-cakes   I remember one Saturday night   We had fried fish and Johnny-cakes      Beng-a-deng   Beng-a-deng      Brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la   There's a brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la la   Brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la   She looks like a sugar in a plum   Plum plum      Show me your motion   Tra la la la la   Come on show me your motion   Tra la la la la la   Show me your motion   Tra la la la la   She looks like a sugar in a plum   Plum plum      Old headwater run dry   Got nowhere to wash my clothes   Old headwater run dry   Got nowhere to wash my clothes      I remember one Saturday night   We had fried fish and Johnny-cakes   I remember one Saturday night   We had fried fish and Johnny-cakes      Beng-a-deng   Beng-a-deng      Brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la   See, brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la la   Brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la   She looks like a sugar in a plum   Plum plum      Old headwater run dry   Got nowhere to wash my clothes   Old headwater run dry   Got nowhere to wash my clothes      Brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la   Look that brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la la   Brown girl in the ring   Tra la la la la   She looks like a sugar in a plum   Plum plum.Ooh, Darling, welcome to the wind,   As we sail our ship of dreams into uncharted waters,   Forget about the stars, and love will lead you higher,   So girl, let's ride the wind."
"The over all mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude. A quote from paragraph @NUM1 is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that expressed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that Narciso grew up in a very warm and happy home and he is very happy and grateful for that.  Another quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" paragraph @NUM2 This shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life. A quote from paragraph @NUM3 is, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood for the many things I learned there about love."" This shows that he is so grateful to his parents for teaching him so much about life, love, and family that he would have never known if it weren't for them..And a real famous cat all dressed up in red,   and he spends the whole year working out on his sled,   it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick..Tearing down forests into feilds reveiling crop circles..So every day I see you in some other face   They crack a smile, talk a while   Try to take your place   My memory serves me far too well      I just sit here on this mountain thinking to myself   You're a fool boy   Why don't you go down   Find somebody   Find somebody else   My memory serves me far too well      It's not as though we just broke up   It's not as though it was yesterday   But something I just can't explain   Something in me needs this pain   I know I'll never see your face again      C'mon now   I've got to be strong now      Now everybody's talking about this new decade   Like you say the magic numbers   Then just say goodbye to   The stupid mistakes you made   Oh my memory serves me far too well      Don't you know that   The years will come and go   Some of us will change our lives   Some of us still have nothing to show   Nothing baby   But memories      And if these wounds   They are self-inflicted   I don't really know   How my poor heart could have protected me   But if I have to carry this pain   If you will not share the blame   I deserve to see your face again      C'mon now   You don't have to be so strong now   Come back      Come back to me darling   I will make it worth your while   Come back to your baby   I miss your kiss   I miss your smile   Seems to me the peace I search to find   Ain't going to be mine until you say you will   Don't you keep me waiting for that day   I know, I know, I know   You hear these words that I say      You can't always get what you want..Maybe far away, or maybe real near by..Adding up subtracting down you find   Yourself sucking the rind      Dying degree, graying amie      Final payment made - had you forgot?.Oh but it's been such a long, long time..Hoochie seats inside yo' truck   Tiffany rocks and trillion cuts   You be Starsky, I be Hutch   Ride shotgun, I pop that clutch   Juicy sweatpants drive me nuts   Take my 2-way, stay in touch   I'm gon' scoop you, heat you up   Take you, bake you, eat you up      [Chorus]      Turn that hair 'round, buck them hips   Love when your hair get stuck to your lips   Apple cobbler sweet and thick   I'm gon' eat you 'til I'm sick   Yo' dessert is worth a grip   I admit you make me trip   Make me want to run to the mall like I'm a trick   I can't believe you're makin' a baller have a fit   Trippin', switchin' past my clique   Lick that juicy, ask my clique   Stretch them jeans girl make them fit   Make me go outside and pit   You know me, my cake is sick   Me and Timbo makin' hits   Apple cobbler, thick and rich   Just how hot can one girl get?.Oh yeah!"
"The author in the memoir created many different moods. One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love. Happiness was the mood of the author because he lived in a good home, had a family full of love and care, and when he said I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home..I gave up on you..Oh, simple things we are..I could give you - a mirror   To show you - dissappointments   I could give you - a history   Could you ever listen in to me?.Sometimes I fantasize   When the streets are cold and lonely   And the cars they burn below me   Don't these times   Fill your eyes   When the streets are cold and lonely   And the cars they burn below me   Are you all alone?.But no, What do we do, we have to go down to this goddamn swamp..Through the night, I want to hold you..There's nowhere you can go where you feel no pain..Still in all I'm happy, the reason is, you see,   Once in a-while along the way, love's been good to me."
"The mood the author created in the memoir was very happy and thankful. He grew up in a traditional Cuban home where his parents cooked and he was able to get a great sense of ""family"". Not just blood relatives but everyone who would do the same as them. There was no racism within their neighborhood. They all came togather Many people, and the for dinner everynight. His parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him. His simple house was a home. These things created the happy and thankful mood.Pick it up, don't put it down   Do you recognize the feeling that I'm passing around   Like your all lit up, feet on the floor   Everywhere you go feel like you've been there before      It's almost easy   To believe this is how it could be   Just to easy   To see it could happen to me      What a feeling when it takes control of you   Everything you need is back ten fold   Like a feeling do it comes and goes   Then it's gone      Oh no      Then the rain came knocked me sideways   Hope the wind will break my fall   I know we all deserve a couple scars   It's just getting old      When the rain just knocked me sideways   I don't know what I don't know   I know we all deserve a couple scars   It's just getting old      Damn it's getting old      I'm all locked up..You got me scared, girl      (Heaven must be weary)   Heaven must be weary   (Your smile is scary)   You know ooh, babe   (Insincere, empty tears)   ?.When she ain't giving you enough to get you through the night   I won't be caught up in the middle   Through your highs and your lows   Baby, 'long as you're not with me, you'll always be alone      [Pre-Chorus]   Do you stay up late, just so you don't dream?.But all you have to do is look at me to know   That every word is true.I call your name....Almighty power, building higher, you'll never be the same!.Le plaisir sans l'amour..'s the man we love the most   Could you be, could you be squeaky clean   And smash any hope of democracy?"
"The mood of the auther might have been in a good mood. the auther might have been doing some of us own family, history and saw that his family did the same things as what they did in the story..Ah we're drinking and we're dancing   And the band is really happening   And the johnny walker wisdom running high   And my very sweet companion   She's the angel of compassion   She's rubbing half the world against her thigh   And every drinker every dancer   Lifts a happy face to thank her   The fiddler fiddles something so sublime   All the women tear their blouses off   And the men they dance on the polka-dots   And it's partner found, it's partner lost   And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:   It's closing time   Yeah the women tear their blouses off   And the men they dance on the polka-dots   And it's partner found, it's partner lost   And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:   It's closing time      Ah we're lonely, we're romantic   And the cider's laced with acid   And the holy spirit's crying, ""where's the beef?"".Not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry?.So darling, have a heart..O mothers let's go down,   Let's go down, don't you want to go down,   Come on mothers let's go down,   Down in the river to pray..Allelujah!.You need to pay the cost..I don't want to go..Is anybody there who give it?"

" My mood while reading this memoir written by the author was a little bittersweet. It talked about sweet little things that were sad but sometimes happy. They talked about sacrifice so much in this memoir. And it feels like they all have to grow up faster because it is so different than our lives ane they are more gratefull then us even though they have like not as much. And it sounds like everyone gets along so easily and yet they make do with all they have. It really touched my heart. .Just let your love flow   Like a mountain stream   And let your love grow      With the smallest of dreams   And let your love show   And you'll know what I mean   It's the season....Uh-uh-uh-uh huh..O ladybird   I have heard you wish to walk me through your garden   I crave your pardon if I woke you with my thinking   Ladybird      O ladybird   I have heard you wish to walk me through your meadow   You'll spread no wings to fly in fright if I'm beside you   Ladybird      All through the winter time   When wood was warm and splintered   Time seemed longer than a goods train   Now that spring is back again I'll ask your name   Your name      O ladybird   I have heard you wish to walk across my pillow   No weeping willow was ever as beautiful, sad as you are   Ladybird      And as you're walking past   I'm laying on the grass and making chains of thought   To snare you with my wit   But bit by bit you fade to gone   Gone      All through the iron season   Love was hanged and treason became   Something of a parlour game   Now sun is back in power I'll ask your name   Your name      O ladybird   I have heard you have to run to tend your children   No flood can drown nor fire blacken purest longing   For ladybird   Ladybird.[Chorus]      I know where I'm goin'   Don't you want to come too?.I never knew how good love could be   All I'd ever known was make believe   So many times Ive played the fool   Baby, til I met you   Now everything has fallen in place   You can tell by the smile on my face   For every lonely tear that Ive cried   I'm that much satisfied      We've got a fine, fine, very fine love   We've got a fine, fine, very fine love   You know it when you find one   Shining like a diamond      Its so fine, fine, very fine love   How did I ever live without your love?.The way you like to run naked in them and   Shampoo your hair   Do you think about why we sneeze in the sun?.Ah the trouble that I've seen."
"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez is appreciation for what you have. An example of appreciation is in @CAPS1 @NUM1 when he states ""After living for a year in a furnished oneroom apartment, @NUM2-year-old Rawedia Maria and @NUM3-year-old @ORGANIZATION1 could afford to move into a modest three room apartment I would soon call my home"". This shows that he is happy to have whatever he can get. Another example is throughout the memoir he always talks about all the problems they have had but is still grateful for everything they have growing up. This is how the mood in the story is appreciation.Baby we can see this through, just give me   All the strength you've got."".I don't get it   I'm so legit      Tell me was it cause I wasn't   Platinum in jewels   That perhaps you thought   I was a little bit even uncool   Kid was that it?.Am I ever gonna change   Take it day by day   My will is weak   And my flesh too strong   This peace I seek   Till thy kingdom comes.[Chorus: x10]      When I wake up in the morning Lord   And the sunlight hurts my eyes..No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight..And you let go, let go, let go,   'cause you know you're getting tired..(I'm back celebrating life)   I'm gonna be your baby yeah   I wanna be up in your bedroom, just all for one night..If not tonight   This is the strangest feeling   Something I can't control   Do I play the fool for you?"
"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is happines. @CAPS1 shows happiness by showing @CAPS1 wanted nothing more that to be with his family doing the things @CAPS1 loved, which @CAPS1 did. @CAPS1 also shows that @CAPS1 is greatful.  ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 feels @CAPS1 could never be as ""courageous"" as his parents and @CAPS1 thanks them for that, ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is joy and happines.There is a flowchart on the bottom of the page, @NUM1 columns: one is mood, the other support. Under mood is happy and grateful. Under support for happy is ""like @CAPS1 wanted nothing more"". For grateful is written (@NUM2)..(A tooth for a tooth)   Do you imagine your suffers will be last?.I said babe it all go wrong, yeah..Honesty is hardly ever heard..Was it something I did   Was it something I said   Was the vision you had   Just a voice in your head   Can you run through the flames   Can you see through the haze   Is this the end of your world   Or just one of your days      I've yet to taste it on my tongue   I get so dangerous on my own      I am your child, the one you need   The love you crave, the mouth you feed   The more you give, the more I take   I am your child, I could be your last mistake      Would you call it untrue   Would you call it a sin   With the burden of proof   Breathing under my skin   Like a ghost from the past   I'm the face in the crowd   And the name that you scream   When you're dreaming out loud      I've yet to taste it on my tongue   I get so dangerous on my own      I am your child, the one you need   The love you crave, the mouth you feed   The more you give, the more I take   I am your child, I could be your last mistake      I've yet to taste it on my tongue   I get so dangerous on my own      I am your child, the one you need   The love you crave, the mouth you feed   The more you give, the more I take   I am your child, I could be your last mistake   I am your child, the one you need   The love you crave, the mouth you feed   The more you give, the more I take   I am your child, I could be your last mistake   I am your child, I could be your last mistake   I am your child, I could be your last mistake   I am your child, I could be your last mistake.Telling secrets in the darkest night..Oh no!.He's   Finishing a little verse beneath a picture of an angel:      Although we all must sometimes stumble   As we journey through this life,   I've never heard you moan or grumble,   The perfect mother and wife..When am I ever going to kick the curse?"

"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful. First, the setting contributes to the mood. The setting of this story is in a nice little home that had a happy environment, surrounded with family and friends. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that"" family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" that quote shows that the neighborhood and the people in it all contributed to the happy mood.

Even though it wasn't easy for them, the author's parents @MONTH1 the sacrifice so the author could have a better life. This made the author's life happy, and the author was grateful. the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and greatful..He's alone and there is no one by his side      In the blackness of the night   I see a sparkle of a star   From the sweet silver tear of a child   And she's clutching at a photograph of long, long ago   When her parents were happy she was too young to know   She's alone and there is no one by her side      I'm alone and there is no one by my side   In the blackness of the night   I seem to wander endlessly   With a hope burning out deep inside   I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out   For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt   I'm alone, and there is no one by my side.Somewhere someone'll have ya      Who do I tell?.I see the lonely road that leads so far away,   I see the distant lights that left behind the day   But what I see is so much more than I can say   And I see you midnight blue..When I look at you I know you're lying   All you say and do   Seems to fall apart and leave you crying      But I thought I could've seen you here today   But you leave me standing each and every way   You told me a pack of lies   That I can't even reason with   Failure of your moral code   The kind of things that I can't give   That's the only thing about it   I can't find anyone to doubt it   That's the only thing about it   I can't find anyone to doubt it   Who do you think you're talking to?.In life that is   To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit   You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night   You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down      And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this   Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be   You say you want to be with me, but how can you say that   When you got niggas hiding in your closet   I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely      I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me   So I stepped on it and then asked my homies   And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas   Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number      I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..   Haven't I seen you before?.Hl      Kann schon sein, da?.Ha!.With no kind of chance for the flag or the Liberty Bell   Wish a Ford and a Chevy could still last ten years, like they should   Is the best of the free life behind us now   Are the good times really over for good?"

"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a happy, loving and grateful mood is created. Narciso writes ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 loves the people that @CAPS1 calls his family, even if they aren't really related. @CAPS1 talks about Alegria, his first friend, and Sergio and it Edelmira, his surrogate grandparents. Narciso aknowledges the fact that his parents left behind their old life and came to @LOCATION3 for him. @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 knows that his parents care about him more than they can ever express. Narciso knows that his neighborhood was a huge part of his life and proves it by writing ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" I think that overall it is an upbeat article about a man's past, where she learned the defenition of love, and how grateful @CAPS1 is to those who taught him it..She don't wanna be a freak no more, (Freak!).Can I offer you salvation, yeah I thing you'll agree,   You're about to fall..What is it?.my heart didn't wanna see   How you played around   And how well you showed me   How wounded love can be      Love is blind   Blinded by love   You're all I can see in my eyes   My mind says, stop   But my heart says, go   Oh, how it hurts to find   It's true when they say that   Love is blind   Love is blind   So blind.My head's moving like a spinning top   How in the world do I make it stop   'Round and 'round and faster still   I'm gonna live till I had my fill      Call the crowd and gather 'round   You're gonna find me in the lost and found   Bright lights, that's my style   Don't be goin' awhile      Got no time for sittin' 'round   Tops are livin' proof to   Ain't gonna wait another day   Pack my bags and get on my way      Gone and turn around   You're gonna find me in the lost and found.Pretty young thing   You need some lovin' (T.L.C.).come on!.Some day!"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very positive. I believe that the mood is positive because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 the whole memoir there is a lot of positiveness. That is the mood from the memoir..and chill   Niggaz from everywhere tryin to do what I did   Runnin' up askin ""yo, yo who is that kid?"".Hope imprisoned in a three foot seam..I'm happier than the morning sun   And that's the way you said it would be   If I should ever bring you inside my life..More!].Now if you know you're with somebody you're gonna take the hotel room tonight,   Make some noise      Meet me at the hotel room, meet me at the hotel room   Meet me at the hotel room, meet me at the hotel room      [Chorus]   Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room,   You can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room..Ohhh, ohhh, oohh..Frozen winds surround my face..Ohh, but it was just my imagination, once again   Runnin' away with me."
"The mood created by the author in this memoir is a very welcoming and happy one. Right off the bat Rodriguez talks about the advantages in his life. The advantage of where he lived, his heritage and his ""family"". When Rodriguez first moved into his house, he thought of it as ""a modest three- room apartment. After all the good memories shared in the apartment Rodriguez attitude about the appartment changed. ""Turned this simple house into a home. His heritage, or culture, filled the air. Some of these cultures included Cuban cooking and music. ""Which I adored to this day"" another mood setting advantage is his ""family"". Rodriguez talks about how his family was always over filling the house with laughter ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" A welcoming and happy mood is created by the author..If I were a shepherd   I would bring a lamb   If I were a wise man   I would do my part   Yet   What I can I give him   Give my heart.This is a riot   Religious and clean      ""All that glitters is cold, all that glitters is cold"".And if I'm dreaming that love at last has found me,   Let me go on dreaming..Yeah!.(Dreamin', dreamin')   (Dreamin') Shu do do do   (Dreamin') Hey, hey   Shoop do do do do do do   I'm dreamin   Shoop do do do do do do   I'm dreamin'   Yeah baby, Dreamin'   You had me thinking right from the start   That our feeling will never keep us apart   You had me thinking that I was the one   But I never knew it was only for fun   Chorus   Tell me that me that I'm dreamin'   Say you're never leavin'   Don't you wanna be with me   (Don't you wanna be with me)   Tell me that I'm dreamin'   Say you're never leavin'   Your heart will be safe you'll see   Isn't it true that my love for you   Is here to stay, it'll never go away   Isn't it true that my love for you   Is here to stay baby there will always be that day   Yeah   Chorus   Know how can I know that summer days are gettin' lonely   And how can I know that my love is gettin' stronger   I dream away   Spoken   Girl if you only knew   Just how much I really love you   I think about you night and day   My love for you will always stay   I never knew it was only for fun   You had me thinkin' that I was the one   Chorus   Come on now you and me girl we were meant to be   Together forever in harmony, yeah (x4)   Tell me that I'm dreaming (x3)   Say it all again   Tell me that I'm dreaming (x3)   Sing it to me one more time   Repeat to fade.Am I wrong?.I shut 'em down   (Get off me!.(A throne in Heaven sat empty for 33 years.)"
"The mood in this paragraph is pride, and hope, and love. Narciso clearly feels very strongly about his family. He states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence alone @CAPS1 the pride and @CAPS2 in Narciso's words. The mood is happy and loving..Been lucked out   Broke a woman's heart   With only myself to blame   Fate ran it's course   I suffered a loss   I learned a lesso in pain      Cheated, lied   I took love for granted   Oh, I paid the price   I won't last a night   I won't make the same mistake twice      Once Is Enough, it's one time too many   The changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough      Love went trough such sudden change   Taken a turn for the worst   The joy turned to fear   The pain got so severe   Lord, I thought I was cursed      Get what you give   It comes around full circle   Oh, I paid the price   Love so fast   I won't make the same mistake twice      Once Is Enough, it's one time too many   Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough   Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough.Clap your feet   (Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa, rock all night, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)      Oh yeah   Stomp your hands   (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)   Clap your feet   (My my my, my my my my my my, my, my, my, my)   Stomp your hands   Clap your feet.(Tell me what you see) The peak of the Holiday Season   (Everythings alright with me) Bringin in the New Year      Everybody parties on a New Year's Eve   Waitin' for the countdown   Everybody lookin at the big tv, talkin' at the same time   Bongin smokes, telling jokes, standin' in the punchline   Everybody parties in the new years eve gonna have a good time (X's 2)      (Tell me what you see)Bringin' in a New Year   (Everything's alright with me)Party on New Years Eve!.Give me the flammable life   I'm cold as a match, ready to strike   So here I go   Here lies a city on fire   Singing along, the arsonist choir   Now here I go   It started with a spark   And burned into the dark   Now here I go      There is a river I found   Into the wild, under the ground   So here I go   A button on a string   And I heard everything   Now here I go      Oh sweet ignition be my fuse   You have no choice you have to choose   Bid farewell to yesterday   Say goodbye I'm on my way   But in the end we all   Come from what's come before   So here I go      Oh sweet ignition be my fuse   You had no choice you had to choose   Bid farewell to yesterday   Say goodbye I'm on my way   I threw it all away because   I had to be what never was   Been so hungry I could lie   You took my word, I took your wine   And held you in my bloody hands   These rattled bones and rubber bands   Washed them in the muddy water   Looking for a dime and found a quarter      But you can't make me change my name   You'll never make me change my name   Pay no mind, now ain't that's something   Fuck it all, I came from nothing      I'm something from nothing   You are my fuse   I'm something from nothing   You are my fuse   It goes oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh   Oh, oh, oh   It goes oh, oh, oh   Alright      No you can't make me change my name   You'll never make me change my name   Pay no mind, now wait that's something   Fuck it all, I came from nothing      I'm something from nothing   I'm something from nothing.I've got a lot that's on my mind   I cannot breathe   Can you hear it, too?.And if you ever need a drink that should be on Sunday,   Man, that's the worst, ha ha!.Don't you see me down here prayin'?.Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh   Woah, oh, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, oh,   Ride, ride, pony, tonight."
"The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family. This shows that the mood is friendship because his parents are great friends to their family.        A second reason is the importance of friend ship. A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This show that the mood is friendship because his parents taught him friendship his whole life..You know, I...   No no no no, don't take 'em off, don't take... Leave 'em on, leave 'em on..Agonizing psychotic solitary hours to decide   Reaching for the light at the slightest noise from the floor   Palms of hands perspire heart goes leaping at a knock from the door..We pass on the street,   My heart skips a beat,   I say to myself, ""Hello Linda!"".Bye, bye babe!.More indignant, less recognizable   You became a bag lady's son   Beating off non stop   To the escort pages   What has changed when you tell   The cross hello?.Mother's preaching Abraham   (She's doin' it she's doin' it)   Brothers they don't give a damn   (Hoo Hoo!).I love you so much it hurts me   Darling that's why I'm so blue   I'm so afraid to go to bed at night   Afraid of losing you   I love you so much it hurts me   And there's nothing I can do   I want to hold you my dear   Forever and ever      I love you so much it hurts me so   I love you so much it hurts me   And there's nothing I can do   I want to hold you my dear   Forever and ever      I want to hold you my dear   Forever and ever      I love you so much it hurts me so.It's still the same old story   A fight for love and glory   A case of do or die."
"The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people..Laurel and holly?.Solo      Wish I never had to leave..Dick meets jane and a fire starts   Jane leaves dick and it breaks his heart   Dick asked jane, ""why'd you leave me? "".We're Squirrels..[L.D.].Clouds will move on soon!.Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?.There's something on my mind   Won't somebody please, please tell me what's wrong      You're just a fool, you know you're in love   You've got to face it to live in this world   You take the good along with the bad   Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad   You know you love him, you can't understand   Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man      He's got me smiling when I should be ashamed   Got me laughing when my heart is in pain   Oh no, I must be a fool   Cause I do anything you ask me to      Without my man I don't want to live   You think I'm lying but I'm telling you like it is   He's got my nose open and that's no lie   And I, I'm gonna keep him satisfied      A wave of action speaks louder than words   The truest thing that I ever heard   I trust my man and all that he do   And I, and I do anything you ask me to"
"Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir. In him memoir Narciso states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" From this statement I feel the mood is loving and kindness.     He also states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents. The last statement I thought really changed the mood was ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood when the author says that is I think thankfulness. Those are so examples of how @PERSON1 changed the mood thought out him memoir..Think enough to even raise the brow   And to laugh and tip that two pronged crown      Well, I see my hands I see my feet   I feel that blood that pumps in me   But where the hell's my mind goin' now?.Oh I said bring back my Bonnie to me..I'm so undemanding   'Cause they so love is blind   I've lived this life pretending   I can bear this hurt deep inside   The truth is that I'm longing   For love that's so divine   I've searched this whole world wishing   She'll be there time after time      Someone put your hand out   I'm begging for your love   'Cause all I do is hand out   A heart that needs your love      I've lived my life the lonely   A soul that cries of shame   And handicapped emotions   Save me now from what still remains   I'll be your story hero   I'll serenade in rhyme   I'm just needing that someone   Save me now, am I the one?.A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year   Let's hope it's a good one without any fear..We've been friends now for so many years   We've been together through the good times and the tears   Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give      We drift apart for a little bit of a spell   One night i get a call and i know that you're well   And days i was down you would help me get out of my hole      Ohh   Let's be friends   Let's be friends   Let's be friends      You told me when my girl was untrue   I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool   I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair      We've been friends now for so many years   We've been together through the good times and the tears   Dim dipple ee dim dipple ay dim dipple oo dim dee aye oh.Oh, yeah      She never cried, she only tried   To fly beyond her dreams   No walls around her mind      Deep inside she'd try to hide   That she was way beyond her means   No borders and no lines      She said that it's your duty to save your soul   To save it for someone   Moment in paradise   Just a moment in paradise   Oh, yeah      Moment in paradise   Just a moment in paradise   Oh, yeah      She floated out upon the wind   That blew my thoughts into the night   She knew the things she had to know      She drifted high above my mind   Blew my brains out, did alright   I think she knew it all along      She said that it's your duty to save your soul   To save it for someone   Moment in paradise   Just a moment in paradise   Oh, yeah      Moment in paradise   Just a moment in paradise   Oh, yeah   Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah      She said that it's your duty to save your soul   To save it for someone   Moment in paradise   Just a moment in paradise   Oh, yeah      Moment in paradise   Moment in paradise   Moment in paradise   Moment in paradise   Oh, yeah   Moment in paradise   Moment in paradise   Just a moment in paradise.Bad and beautiful      Hooray for Mr..I got a picture in my mind,   The thought is so clear of the love I need here,   Like D-B magic, and why don't you appear,   (have you seen her?)"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, calm, and kind mood. It is a happy mood because the author only talks about the good things that happened to him and his family. It is a very calm mood because nothing very exciting or nothing very sad happens, everything in the memoir is very calm. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is also a very kind mood because his parents are very kind. In paragraph @NUM1, ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.

"The author creates a verry good mood in the story. It is a mood of well-being and happiness in their family. I think the author has a verry good bond with his family. I think that because he talks about being with his family alot listening to Cuban Music and eating dinner together. He also appreciates his parents alot because they left cuba to come to the United States so he would have a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be greatful to my parents love and sacrifice""..Stop your tears from falling,   The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night   All to see at night..It's defective!.I know just where your hot spot at   You can not deny that, so do not try that   I do not buy that      [Chorus].Between the darkness on the street   And the houses filling up with light   Between the stillness in my heart   And the roar of the approaching night   Somebody's calling after somebody   Somebody turns the corner out of sight   Looking for somebody   Somewhere in the night   Tender is the night   When you hold your baby tight   Tender are the motions, tender is the night   Between a life that we expected   And the way it's always been   I can't walk back in again   After the way we fight   When just outside there are people laughing   Living lives we used to lead   Chasing down the love they need   Somewhere in the night   Tender is the night   And the benediction of the neon light   Tender are the hunters, tender is the night   You're gonna want me tonight   When you're ready to surrender   Forget about who's right   When you're ready to remember   It's another world at night   When you're ready to be tender   Tender, tender tender   And in the hard light of an angry sun   No one remembers what was said or done   Tender are the words they choose   You win, I win, we lose   Tender   Tender is the night   Tender   The benediction of the neon light   Tender   Tender are the hunters   Tender is the night   When they hold each other tight   Tender   Tender are the undercover   Tender   The stranger and the secret lover   Tender   Tender are the motions   Tender is the night   When you hold your baby tight   Tender, tender tender.We thought we'd base our civilization upon yours,   'Cause we're all dead from our necks up, now ain't we?.Albert backed   The Great Exhibition..I will be free, of the world,   Eldorado.""Why do you come for me to wed?"

"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy, grateful, and loving. The @CAPS1 shares her background life with us.

""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day filled the air."" This shows that atl this time the @CAPS1 is grateful about her cooking and music. The @CAPS1 shows her self as a really grateful for all her parents have done for him. ""I thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"". The @CAPS1 mood is so warming when she expresses her love for the parents, music, and cooking skills. The @CAPS1 creates many moods throught the memoir, but I think mostly she thankful for her family and heritage..Salvami l'anima?.Uhh, yeah, New York we speedballin ballin ballin   WOO, yeah, uh uhh we speedballin   L.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!.You sometimes drive me crazy   But I worry about you   I know it makes no difference   To what you're going through   But I see the tip of the iceberg   And I worry about you...

In this neighborhood the family raise as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from, water, shelter, and clothing. The reason they move from Cuba was to begin a better life in the United States which they never gave up until the day that they finally had enough money to live here..Mmmm, love and compassion, their day is coming   All else are castles built in the air   And I wonder when we are ever gonna change?.We're the horniest boys   With the corniest ploys   Who take the easiest girls   To our sleaziest worlds      With our lecherous plans   In our treacherous hands   You'd be wasting your time   Saying no, it's a crime      All that we live for you'll regret   All you remember we'll forget      We are the dead of night   We're in the zombie room   We're twilight's parasites   With self-inflicted wounds      We are the dead of night   We're in the zombie room   Heavenly oversights   Eating from silver spoons      With our decadent minds   And our innocent lines   You'll be playing our games   With your bodies in flames      When delirious fun   Has seriously begun   You'll be down on your knees   You'll be begging us please      All we're demanding you'll supply   All we're accused of we'll deny      We are the dead of night   We're in the zombie room   We're twilight's parasites   With self-inflicted wounds      We are the dead of night   We're in the zombie room   Heavenly oversights   Eating from silver spoons.So it's back to the block time to play   It's just another day around the way, hey   [Chorus: 1x]   [Verse 2]   Time to chill, hit the hill, uptown let's keep it sight's   Shoot some pool, act a fool, cause it's own tonight   I'm doin the knowledge, it's not easy, easy   Watchin a cop cuff a kid for sellin a clip to a D.T..You get on board anytime you like      Like sittin' on pins and needles   Things fall apart, it's scientific      Sleeping on the interstate   Woah ho ah   Getting wild, wild life   Checkin' in, a checkin' out!.Dad says Mom is cheating, you can see the   Children long for happy families, the game that's sure to please..Six minutes, six minutes   Six minutes, six minutes      I know why you're here   I ain't sayin' nothin'      Hey yo, baby, I know why you're here   I know what you're doing   I can see it in your eyes, you're up to somethin'   I know what it is, but we're still cool   And we can socialize, I'm peepin' ya, baby   I'm holdin' back, I'm not lettin' go   Cause a fool doesn't have a shoulder to cry on   So give me a kiss and your service   Whether you like a mister or a miss      [Chorus]   Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me   I know why you're here   But I ain't sayin' nothin'   Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me   I know why you're here   But I ain't sayin' nothin'   Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me   I know why you're here   But I ain't sayin' nothin'   Hey yo, baby, I know you don't love me   I know why you're here   But I ain't sayin' nothin'      Baby, you're my dear, I know why you're here   I know why you came, I know what you're thinkin'   I know what you need, and that's what I've got   You think I'm goin' crazy, no, I'm not drinking   I know what you want, I made ya want it   Take my hand, listen to the man   You have a plan, don't even risk it   What do you want, a biscuit?.Which I will erase without hint of reward   As I am only a messenger   And you a sheep in process of evolution   Almost at death with yourself   And on the staircase of birth..Loving you is like a puzzle   Just when I think that this is it   You shake me up   The pieces just don't fit   It's like a ...

"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is said in all different ways. In paragraph @NUM1 when she talks about her love for cooking the mood is calm with a dash of spice to it. Since she is Cuban I like to think the cooking is spicy. In paragraph @NUM2 she states, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family..."" That is a happy loving mood. To be able to say that means you have some pretty amazing neighbors. In paragraph @NUM3, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is the most important mood set in this memoir because she is thanking her parents for her life that she has. That is a very respectful thing to do. Everyone does it, but did you write a memoir about it?.You're spreadin lies all over town about the way you brushed me off and put me   Down I'm her to say make no mistake my heart cracked but it did not break I   Can't deny the hurt was deep the way you slammed that door and walked right out   On me but I'm telling you get one thing straight my heart cracked but it did not   Break shatterd dreams lay every where broken promises are all we share I   Finally took all I could take my heart cacked but it did not break well I was   Blue but for long cause this brand new love I got has made me strong and I'm   Over you and all the ache my heart cracked but it did not break shattered   Dreams lay everywhere broken promises are all we share I finally took all I   Could take mty heart cracked but it did not break.Yes, I'm going to the cold bank..If you're wondering why I've not been speaking my mind sir   It took so long since I could call this my home   My shapes of confusion fit holes of frustration   And there's nothing worse then being home on your own      You can colour my life   Until it fits with your own   You can colour my life   Until it fits with your own      I've been wondering why you've not been speaking your mind sir   I've coloured my life and I'll make no bones   My shapes of confusion fit holes of frustration   You can colour my life until it fits with your own      You can colour my life   Until it fits with your own   You can colour my life   Until it fits with your own   You can colour my life   Until it fits with your own   You can colour my life   You can colour my life      If you're wondering why I've not been speaking my mind sir   It took so long since I could call this my home   My shapes of confusion fit holes of frustration   You can colour my life until it fits with your own      You can colour my life   Until it fits with your own   You can colour my life   Until it fits with your own   You can colour my life   Until it fits with your own   You can colour my life   You can colour my life      Colour my life   Colour my life   Colour my life.I'm on a mexican radio   I'm on a mexican radio   I'm on a mexican radio   I'm on a mexican radio      Radio radio...

"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The blueprints of our lives, there was a very solidary mood. The @PERSON1 family was so happy to be in @LOCATION1 and be free, and no longer in Cuba. It was a very loved environment with friends and family always coming to their table. They were a very caring family. They always had the arms and door wide open to other refugees until They got back on their feet. They were a happy, loving, and caring @CAPS1 family..One more big score?.(Julia)   Will we still be there?.To face a lie and dare to try again, but there's nothing like a woman   With a spell of make believe to make a new believer of a man..What's the matter son?.Why don't you do the Head and Shoulders with me..And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees   Laughing as it passes through the endless summer   Making for the sea..The field is cut and bleeds too red,   The cannon balls fly 'round my head,   The infirmary man may count me dead,   When I've gone to find my ain true love..Why take it lying down ?"
"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso created a few moods that are very relatable, yet make you think. One mood is happiness. This reading feels happy from the beginning to hand because it shows how Narciso went through his life, and what he loves about his childhood paragraph @NUM1 says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences show he loved the environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which made him happy.Narciso also created a mysterious mood. This mood made you think about your home, and what the word 'family' really means. Narciso's family was a great, big, loving group of people-many of whom were not even related. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows thier consideration of family was large, and inspiring.The main mood in this memoir from Narciso is gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did. He is mostly grateful to his parents, as paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice."" Narciso's main mood is gratefullness because he is grateful toward everyone & everything that made his life good, and made him what he is now..We're having a heat wave,   A tropical heat wave,   The way that she moves   That thermometer proves   That she certainly can can-can..Somehow you made it in the big wide world   And you're absolutely home and dry   You got away from a one horse town   And the only way out was to fly      You heard a lot about an easy street   And it seems like the place to be   You heard some talk about a slippery slope   But you think ""it can't happen to me""      Vulture culture   Use it or you lose it   Vulture culture   Choose it or refuse it   Hollywood is calling won't you join the dance   Moving onto Wall Street why not take a chance   It's a vulture culture   Never lend a loser a hand   Just a vulture culture   Living off the fat of the land      Nowhere to turn around and catch your breath   It's all relatively trouble free   No need to bother with the bottom line   Or a money back guarantee      You sign a deal that's been etched in stone   It's absolutely cut and dry   That's when they got you in the danger zone   And the only way out is to die      Vulture culture   Use it or you lose it   Vulture culture   Choose it or refuse it   Hollywood is waiting striking up the band   Everyone on Wall Street shakes you by the hand   Such a vulture culture   Never lend a loser a hand   Just a vulture culture   Living off the fat of the land      Use it or you lose it   Choose it or refuse it   Hollywood's a no go not a second chance   Nobody on Wall Street gives a second glance   It's a vulture culture   Moving to the beat of the band   It's a vulture culture   Never lend a loser a hand   It's just a vulture culture   Living off the fat of the land.Bang bang, deep pain   No one does what you did to me..Till fortune found a girl who fanned a flame he thought had died   Whose burning beauty cut him like a knife..Here comes my baby, here she comes now,   Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,   Never to be mine, no matter how I try..You got me runnin', you got me hidin'   You got me run, hide, hide, run, any way you wanna let it roll   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got me doin' what you want me to, baby why ya' wanna let go      I'm goin' up, I'm goin' down   I'm goin' up, down, down, up, any way you wanna let it roll   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got me doin' what you want me to, baby why ya' wanna let go      You got me peepin', you got me hidin'   You got me peep, hide, hide, peep, any way you wanna let it roll,   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got me doin' what you want me to, baby why ya' wanna let go.There you go, talking bout you miss me so,   That you love me so, why I let you go,   There you go, cause your lies got old,   Now look at you, there you go..Oh It's Halloween   Every Night To Me Is Halloween   Like An Ancient Scene   You Know Just What I Mean      Halloween You Are My Pride   Halloween Not Just A Dream      The Moon Is Full, Another Perfect Day Has Began   Like A Demon's Eye, That Devil's Eye   Will We Ever Die      Halloween You Are My Pride   Halloween Not Just A Dream      Every Night Will Be Another Evil Scene   Like In Horror Dreams I Want   I Command You To Scream      Halloween You Are My Pride   Halloween Not Just A Dream      Halloween...

"The author creates a warm, joyful mood in the memoir. He talks about the fond childhood memories he has in a way that gives the reader a warm, joyful feeling inside. For example, although his parents endured hardships in coming to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, they created an inviting home environment. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". (Â¶ @NUM1) This imagery creates a feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't nessecarily based on blood. The author's community was like a family. ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community."" (Â¶ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (Â¶ @NUM3) @CAPS1, the author talks of ""the warmth of the kitchen"", (Â¶ @NUM4) and how the air was always filled with love. All of these passages give the reader a mental picture of joyful and warm family gatherings, instilling those feelings. This is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood. Although his parent's life was tough, they made his life full of joy and warmth, showing that one can make tough experiences into positive situations..Who do you love?.Medium..Keeping her good like there was no other, Brother,   there must be a way, to get through the day, without getting   stuck in the role of the prey..Snipping, snipping, snipping goes the scissor man,   Maybe you are in his book of names..I am a man who looks after the pigs   Usually I get along okay..Like a scar that won't fade, I'll be yours..It's true that all the men you knew were dealers   Who said they were through with dealing   Every time you gave them shelter   I know that kind of man   It's hard to hold the hand of anyone   Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender   Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender..The wedding took place and people came from many miles around   There was plenty merriment, cider and wine abound   But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met   'Cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget."
"I believe that the mood in this memoir is happy because the athor is talking about his first friend (land loards daghter) the great cooking and music that his home had. how greatful he is to his parents for moving to america for him, all the celibrations they had for people, how everybody in the naborhood were friends, and much he loved his family. What about that is unhappy.Don't try to stop me now      Following the footpath one fine day,   When I asked a wise man which was the way,   He said ""follow you heart and look for yourself,   And come back and tell me what you have learned""..Why do I have to dream of you when I don't want to dream a lie?.You know you gotta give it your all   And don't you be afraid if you fall   You only living one so tell me?.I gotta tell you what I'm feelin' inside,   I could lie to myself, but it's true   There's no denying when I look in your eyes,   Girl I'm out of my head over you   And I lived so long believin' all love is blind   But everything about you is tellin' me this time      It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind   Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever      I hear the echo of a promise I made   When you're strong you can stand on your own   But those words grow distant as I look at your face   No, I don't want to go it alone   I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line   But everything about you is tellin' me this time      It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind   Forever, until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin' you forever - yeah!.That's right   Cork screwin 'round the interstate   With peanut butter and rubber snakes   Clear the way move over   Look out Bud   Here comes the mud!.Now if youve got lumbago, rheumatics or gout, or a pain in your Robert E.

"In the memoir, the author creates a loving, caring and friendly mood. He creates this mood by describing the atmosphere of his home. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The setting of their warm, welcoming home contribute greatly to the mood of the memoir. The author's greatfulness to his parents selflessness and courage also contributes. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" His greatfulness creates a thankful mood through paragraph six and seven, ""it was here were I learned the true definition of ""family"""". This quote helps bring out the love in the mood. The warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the authors point get across in a meaningful way..If your heart settles on me, I'm for the taking..[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]   ALL DAY - car jacks, get out the van   As soon as they step out I pop 'em anyway, BLAAM!.Left to right..I conquer evil, let evil know my name..Late afternoon, dreaming hotel   We just had the quarrel that sent you away   I was looking for you, are you gone, gone?.Nikki Minaj)      Goodmorning New York,   Good afternoon New Orleans,   Goodnight America,   This is Young Money...

"The mood and Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was love and respect. Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family does not only include blood-relatives. Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piles up, and it is clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents..I'm minted!.Throw your rollies in the sky   Wave em side to side and keep their hands high   While I give your girl the eye, player please   Lyrically, niggas see, B.I.G..I-I-I'm ready for ya..The motel lights were blinkin'   On my chartreuse four door Lincoln   On the dock the fish were stinkin'   I simply didn't have a care      And the old men sit 'round the cracker barrels   The children hum their Christmas carols   The train tracks all run parallel   But they'll all meet up one day      On a dusty pew in a vestibule   Sits the Devil playing pocket pool   He's waiting for the next poor fool   Who forgot that it was Sunday      We used to tell each other lies   With our orange plastic button eyes   In a former life on a motel chair   I was Charlie Parker's teddy bear      Yeah, me and Bird we'd stay up late   I used to watch him contemplate   While his horn would sit by the window and   Wait till it was time for him to blow it      On a dusty pew in a vestibule   Sits the Devil playing pocket pool   He's waiting for the next poor fool   Who forgot that it was Sunday      The only song I ever knew   Was ""Moonlight Bay on the Avenue""   These are the tales from the Devil's chin   Charlie I could've been a contender      And the old men sit round the cracker barrels   The children hum their Christmas carols   The train tracks all run parallel   But they'll all meet up one day      On a dusty pew in a vestibule   Sits the Devil playing pocket pool   He's waiting for the next poor fool   Who forgot that it was Sunday   Who forgot that it was Sunday..That's just the way it goes   All at once you hear   ""Hold me..So how do we now come to be   Afraid of sunlight?.(ladies)   Oh yes he is yeah (tenors)      Repeat      Verse:   I don't need   Material things   All I need   Is the love you give   This holiday   I came to say   That Jesus Is   The Only Way      Jesus is the reason   For the season   Yes oh yes he is..Now I'm going to wilderness   on a horse that I can trust   I will die where I fall   in the hot dry dust   And if you come to that place   remember this truth   That he who's born to property   is he who's born to lose   Will you bury my soul   where the dust meets the sea   Will you bury my heart   at Wounded Knee!"
"The mood described by the auther was warm and full of happiness. In the memoir, the auther @ORGANIZATION1 talks about the importance of his family Which always brings a comforting feeling. He Shared that he ""was born into a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New jersey"" but that it did not matter where he lived but who he lived with. The mood you get when you read this memoir is mixed because Of the way he describes his parents life, his life and his home. When he says ""the innocence of Childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" he is talking about how close they all are and that, that is what matters, when you read that you feel the comfort, happiness, joy and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parent and everyone around him..When I was just a little child (little child)   Happiness was there awhile (there awhile)   And from me it....One, two, three, four   Hey (eh) forever, hey (eh) forever      It's you, and me   Movin' at the speed of light into eternity (yeah)   Tonight, is the night   To join me in the middle of ecstasy   Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music around you (around you)      I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there   So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby   We can go anywhere, go anywhere   But first, it's your chance   Take my hand, come with me      [Chorus]   It's like I waited my whole life   For this one night   It's gon' be me you and the dance floor   Cause we only got one night   Double your pleasure, double you fun   And dance forever ever ever   Forever ever ever, forever ever ever, forever (forever)   Ever ever ever, forever ever ever, forever ever ever   Forever on the dance floor      Feels like we're on another level   Feels like our loves intertwine   We can be two rebels   Breakin' the rules   Me and you, you and I   All you gotta do is watch me   Look what I can do with my feet, baby   Feel the beat inside   I'm drivin', you could take the front seat (front seat)   Just need you to trust me (trust me)   Girl girl girl, it's like now      [Chorus]      It's a long way down   We so high off the ground   Sendin' for an angel to bring me your heart   Girl where did you come from?.Shouldn't be gone for very long.

" In the article the author is trying to say how good his past was. The mood of the article is that it was happy memories and the smell of his mom's cooking and the memories. As a child the author's memories were happy and home setting mostly the mood was good throughout the story. Throughout the article his memories of his childhood home were happy and good..Liquor market   Lots of flats   Another 24-hour chemist   Self-Serve gas   I said all these things   Serve me well   I said all these things   Serve me well, yeah      It's hypnotizing   It sends me to sleep   No one talks to anyone else   It's frightening   Everybody's minds are blank   Oh - oh hypnotizing      I'm always using you   When I'm out of cash   I stare through this window   On a bus, moving fast   I said all these things   Serve me well   I said all these things   Serve me well - yeah.It's freezing in Bristol   There's love on the tele   A girl grinning at me   She's doing the shimmy      And she's cruel   And she's skinny   And she's a fool   For the last living rock king      It's her thrill   It's her wonder   It's her will   It's her way home      She's right where she always wanted to be   She can't change   Change...

"The mood of the author is @CAPS1 and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live at there house. When the didnt have much money, the took any job the could get so they could care there son, Narciso, they had a three bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country, they also had there house full of love and life. Also they came to this country with not knowing how to speak this language. So the mood of this story at the author seems to be proud..It ain't too many niggaz that can do it like I can   When them records ain't sellin' and the stitches start tellin'   Motherfucker they yellin, get 'em Buck!!.Give me all your tears   Let me turn them into pearls   Let me turn all the tears   That you've cried into pearls   Hand them to me, I'm gonna keep      Keep them for you   I want to hold you,   I want to kiss you   I want to mend what is broken..This day never seems   This pain, never..Jigging along with the fiddle-dee-dee..Hip canteen   You always make the scene   You're a crazy child      It's a sad thing   Bourbons all around   To stop that feeling when you're living   In a small town      You're long and lean   But things don't get you down   You're a top ten kingpin in the borders   Of you're hometown      You can't get hip   You work the jobs I've quit   Can you dig that style?.Until I found the one I needed at my side,   I think I would have been a sad man all my life..Mumbo jumbo words to say,   Are you coming out,   Coming out,   Coming out to play?.They have bird's-nest soup, seaweed soup,   Noodle soup, poodle soup,   Talking crows with the croup,   Almost anything."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful. That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are..[Verse 1: Kirk Franklin]   Think I'm gonna walk away   You're messing up my life today (wassup)   This time I refuse to pray   Still you keep calling me (calling me)   I don't wanna see your face   The thing I love you erased (Come on!).But there's only one authority,   And that's the authority on high..When asked if he ever felt remorse while sittin' up in that pen..Everybody's searching for something, they say..I don?t need ?em I got your respect   KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ?...like we're here today..Could this be the land of the free?"
"The mood in this memoir is happyness, love, and warmth. It is to be thankful for what you have and not what you want to have. Narciso was just happy to have such a loving family. Inside of Narciso's home it is very happy loving and warm. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family. Overall the mood created by the author in the story is love..I know all your desires   Your heart is so full of pain   Is there something I can provide   When you feel like life's passed you by      I'm on your side   Gimme this gimme that   Gimme this gimme that   Gimme this gimme that   Gimme this gimme that   Gimme this gimme that   Gimme this gimme that   Gimme this gimme that   Gimme this gimme that      Please don't ask me my name   Does it matter?.here comes the intro   It's time to let it go   I live the life of my rhyme, I think I'll let it show   So, keep it goin' so the mic can stay warm   Then I know I've been doin' my job 'cause there'll be sweat pourin'      So pick and choose your weapon but don't slip   I'm here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip   So pump your fist like this, but don't miss   The hook and the break when you decide to dance to this   Lyrical concept that's meant for the dance floor   I know you adore 'cause that's what you came for   The ice rhymer is back and livin' large   And when I'm at a show you better wear camouflage   'cause there was plenty who thought I couldn't swing this   But now all I get from the crowd is just a pumped fist   So sing along with the chorus 'cause it's a hit   Or stay at home alone 'cause ice will be workin' it      [Chorus]   Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work   It, work it..I didn't know what time it was   You hold my hand..Must I cling to the thrills of life   Ash to ash and dust to dust      But all this talk is only poetry   Only as true as we would believe   We must live to fight the negative   Not court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh   In defeat oh oh oh oh      You have looked at me this way   We are all from the same seed   Take us forward through the tomb   There's no finish to a life.Words and Music by Carl Stutz   And Edith Lindeman.I don't know when it got this way   I don't know how long she's gonna stay   Every week it's the same in her room   That's why I came      Here I go, I go again   Our rendezvous never seem to end   I know where I'll be, I'll make this confession   Back in her bed for another goddamn session      [Chorus]   I'll never learn   God knows I try   Keep coming back for session   And I don't know why   I'll never learn, I'll never see   Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on me      Some might say it's a fling   For all I know it don't mean a thing   Either way I can't complain   Ain't no strings   Guess I got it made      Here I go, I go again   Our rendezvous' never seem to end   I know where I'll be   I'll make this confession   Back in her bed for another goddamn session      [Chorus].One..I see his snowy white face but I'm not afraid."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 shows @CAPS1 for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, culture, and etc. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez..That's why I know, yes, I know,   Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so..I'm trying to wipe you from my eyes, but the tears keep fallin' through..Where have they been?.For way too long..It's seventh heaven 'cause there are angels all around,      Among my frivolous thoughts,   I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts   The indications reveal,   (Wake me if you're out there),      That few of us realize life is quite so real,   So if you're dying to see,   I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity   So if you're dying to see,      I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity.I was stealing kisses from a boy   Now I'm begging affection from a man   In my house dress   Don't you know who I am?.[Sean Kingston]   I see them coming, yeah..Ringo: Oh, I like grapes."
" The mood created by the author in the memoir. The character Narciso's parent moved from cuba to the united states to have better oppertunitys in life. When @PERSON1 came to america he had became friends with a girl name  Alegria..And he says roll, roll, roll brother trucker,   I say where and you say when..Take me to your heart,   Never let me go..Little one it's so nice to have you near me   To feel once again the love you bring here   Oh my little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt   Say the word and daddy will make it disappear      Oh my little one   Bring your love here   Little one   I need you near      Little one   Don't live in fear of the future   'Cause I will always be there   Oh my little one      Music is my life, I hope you understand   Travelling on the road with me you can see the way we live   Oh my little one   I will always cherish these days with you      As time goes by I hope you see the love I tried to give   Oh my little one   Let your love flow   My little one      Like a flower you'll grow   Someday you'll have your own little one   And you will always be there   Little one, it's so nice to have you near me      To feel once again the love you bring here   Oh my little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt   Say the word and daddy will make it disappear   Oh my little one      Bring your love here   Little one   I need you near me   Little one      Don't live in fear of the future   'Cause I will always be there   Oh my little one   Let your love flow      My little one   Like a flower you'll grow   Someday you'll have your own little one   And you will always be there      My little one....Lucky me   I guess I'm the chosen one   Color and madness   First in line I put my money down   Some freedom   Is the tiniest cell it's hell      But one foot wrong   And I'm gonna fall   Somebody gets it   Somebody gets it   Put one foot wrong   And I'm gonna fall   Somebody gets it   Somebody gets it   All the lights are on   But I'm in the dark   Who's gonna find me   Who's gonna find me?.There is still time to change.Eh..You could see me reaching,   So why couldnt you have met me halfway   You could see me bleeding   But you could not put pressure on the wound      You only think about yourself..Put the H with the A with the TE,   Give it power, you could destroy me   Put the L, with the O with the VE,   Give that power and you don't have to say anything      Words are just words   They get in my way   Bla bla bla bla   Blaaaa      Words are just words   They get in my way   Words are just words   They get in my way      Take B,   And just let it be, B..."
"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven..Just enough to hold my ?.Do you want to?.like a movie star..But she's grinning,   And I can see my blood on her teeth..Can't buy me love      I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend   If it makes you feel alright   I'll get you anything, my friend   If it makes you feel alright      For I don't care too much for money   For money can't buy me love      I'll give you all I got to give   If you say you love me too   I may not have a lot to give   What I got, I'll give to you      For I don't care too much for money   For money can't buy me love   Can't buy me love      Everybody tells me so   Can't buy me love   No, no, no, no      Say you don't need no diamond ring   And I'll be satisfied   Tell me that you want those kind of things   That money just can't buy      For I don't care too much for money   For money can't buy me love   Can't buy me love      Everybody tells me so   Can't buy me love   No, no, no, no      Say you don't need no diamond ring   And I'll be satisfied   Tell me that you want those kind of things   That money just can't buy      For I don't care too much for money   For money can't buy me love      Can't buy me love   Can't buy me love.Oh please don't you think baby that I am wrong to cry, yeah..[Hook:]   I don't need no niggas in my section   All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches ah   I don't need no niggas in my section   All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches ah      [Chris Brown]   Higher than the moon, nigga what up   They ain't worth it, nigga need to shut up   Fallin in the pussy, face down in the buttuck   It ain't shit to her, me I'm just a fuck up   Fuck a hand shake nigga we ain't brothers   On that West side where they reppin for they colors   If you talking big shit, then my dick will make you stutter   All up in your face like its (...)

" The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and @CAPS1. I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are surten parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1 and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir..More capital T, Lee, to satisfy me..Stand up tall and get some respect   And always remember, keep yourself in check      Take a chance kid,   Take a chance..Mothers crying in the street   Children dying at their feet, tell me why   People starving everywhere   There's too much food but none to spare, tell me why      Can you see that shaft of sunlight   Can you see it in my eyes   I can feel the fire that's burning   Anger and hope so deep   So deep within my heart   Before my eyes   For some it's too late   It seems there's no-one listening      People sleeping in the streets   No roof above, no food to eat, tell me why   See the questions in their eyes   Listen to their children's cries, tell me why      If there's a God   Is he watching   Can he give a ray of hope   So much pain and so much sorrow   Tell me what does he see   When he looks at you   When he looks at me   What would he say   It seems there's no-one listening      Who would think it still could happen   Even in this time and place   Politicians, they may save themselves   But they won't save their face   Just hope against hope   It's not too late      You say there's nothing you can do   Is there one rule for them and one for you   Tell me why      Listen can you see that shaft of sunlight   Can you see it in my eyes   I can feel the fire that's burning   Anger and hope so deep   So deep within my heart   Before my eyes   For some it's too late   It seems there's no-one listening      Hurry for me, hurry for me, they cry.I'm deep in a dream, deep in the trees   I'm doing my thing with the chimpanzees   There's somebody watching you everywhere   Except in your dreams, they can't see you in there   At least not yet, though someday they will try   And on that day they'll see the rhino can fly.[Both]   Don't leave me now or never..Who can I see?.They put the finger on you,   Finger gang..I see the firelight in your eyes."
"The mood of this memoir is the importance of family. @ORGANIZATION1 says in the beginning how much he loves his cuban culture and heritage. For example, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Narciso Rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much. Him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us.""  Narciso also became close to other immigrants that were not blood-related to him. ""Growing up in this envirement instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighberhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" Narciso was close to many people who he considered family..All the ways I cared for you   Are working like you want them to   As I break down and you stay strong   I write my own forgiveness song      I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug   But it's not your concern   Another night and it's only right   I toss and I turn in the bed I made      The wine dark room the flashing eyes   That hung me from my string of lies   You said you were numb from wondering   I guess I wasn't listening      I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug   But you're not concerned   Another night and it's only right   That I toss and I turn in the bed I made      With my own hands   I fashioned this frame   And into the wood   I carved out my name      I try to lie down and sleep it off like a drug   But you're not concerned   Another night and it's only right   That I toss and I turn in the bed I made      And it's only right   That I toss and I turn   In the bed I made      The bed I made   The bed I made.I'll go on loving you   Don't ask me why   Don't know what else to do   Don't ask me why      How sad my heart would be   If you should go   Though you're not good for me   I want you so      It's not the kind   Of love I dream about   But it's the kind   That I can't live without      You're all I'm longing for   Don't say good-bye   I need you more and more   Don't ask me why   I need you more and more   Don't ask me why.I look to you..There may be trouble ahead   But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance   Let's face the music and dance   Before the fiddlers have fled      Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have THE chance   Let's face the music and dance   Soon, we'll be without the moon   Humming a different tune - and then....Grain of sand in traffic jam, and I'm late..Satellite strung from the moon   And the world your balloon   Peeping Tom for the mother station..Everything, it seems,   Would be brighter if your nights were spent with some girl      Yeah, you're falling all around..This bloody road remains a mystery   This sudden darkness fills the air   What are we waiting for?"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and comforting. The author described his home with great words and descriptions. While describing the meals and get togethers, the author made me feel at home. Memories are sometimes greater than plans of the future. Memories of homes are the best in remembering times at home. This memoir made me think of past times and happy memories. The vocabulary and extra information in this memoir made the mood of it very happy and comforting and made me want to read more about his past life..Wise men say   Only fools rush in   But I can't help   Falling in love with you   Shall I stay   Would it be a sin   If I can't help falling in love with you   Like a river flows   Surely to the sea   Darling so it goes   Some things are meant to be   Take my hand,   Take my whole life too   For I can't help falling in love with you   Like a river flows   Surely to the sea   Darling so it goes   Some things are meant to be   Take my hand,   Take my whole life too   For I can't help   Falling in love with you   No, I can't help   Falling in love with you.Break Up The Concrete      There was a red brick road where I grew up on   And a pretty stone wall round a fragrant lawn   Fish in the pond that sparkled in the dawn   But it ain't no more it's all gone gone gone      [Chorus]   Whoa!.Here to command the hip-hop land   Kick it live with a box inside my hand   I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go   But I know I can't live without my radio      Farmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out,   Cool out, you know what I'm sayin'?.You're my sun and I'm your satellite..Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me   Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me   Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you please      I used to have plenty of money, the finest clothes in town   But bad luck and trouble overtaken me, bound to get me down   Please have mercy, Lord have mercy on me   Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you please      Keep on working now, child   Lord every morning      Well if I've been a bad boy, baby, I declare I'll change my ways   I don't want bad luck and trouble to follow me all my days   Please have mercy, Lord have mercy on me   Well if I've done somebody wrong, Lord, have mercy if you.One fight at the cross   And now God is wining..[Intro:]   Ladies and gentlemen   We are gathered here today   To join   I see it, yeah   Yeah, yeah   I like this right here   Yeah, yeah   One-two, one-two, in the place to be   As you can see   I am the crush groovin'   There's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight   The record breaking and the record making   Yeah, yeah, turn this up      From the states to over seas   Every city in between I hit the scene   Catch fire like kerosene   Geting paid for more then a decade   We been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the pd invasion   Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars   Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar   Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?.Pressure, pressure   Can you take the heat boy   I want to know are you just weak boy   Pressure, pressure   I don't want to make you sweat baby   But you don't even know what pressure is   We haven't got started yet      I know you've been watching my ever and know   Baby what that look of your face (right now)   I'm not your awage leaded don't look so surprised   And most boy's keep kick off at my peace   (and that's a fact)      Oh I'm not try to scare you no   I'm only try to live my life ah   So part and me for askin' baby   But boy you look a little of tyle   Tell me      [Chorus:]   Am I too much   Am I too much for you   Ah ah ah   Am I too much   Am I too much for you uh   (and listen up)      If you want to know me your'll understand   Why are I anger want who I am (ah ha)   You say it tied to tryin' to fear you and out   I guess know right know   I set the trend and you love it      Oh I'm not try to scare you no   I'm only try to live my live ah   So part and me for askin' baby   But boy you look a little of tyle   Tell me      [Chorus]      Pressure, pressure   Can you take the heat boy   I want to know are just weak boy   Pressure, pressure   I don't want to make you sweat baby   But you don't even know what pressure is   We haven't got started yet      Are you nervous   Or do always eacter scene      Oh I'm not try to scare you no   I'm only try to live my life ah   So part and me for askin' baby   But boy you look a little of tyle   Tell me      [Chorus: x2]"

"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives @PERSON1 he makes the mood seem the loving, cheerful, and grateful.The mood is grateful to Rodriguez's parents for making his house more of a home among other things. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 his parents did a ton for Rodriguez and he is constantly grateful. Their is also a lot of love in the mood of the book because there are lots of mentions of family. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family."" @CAPS2 arms opened and a big ""family"" are surely signs of lots of love. The mood of the excerpt is also cheerful because as Rodriguez says ""Passionate salsa music filled the air."" And ""a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air."" Music and feasting are two of the most cheerful things there are.By recalling experiences from his childhood @PERSON2 manages to make the mood of his memoir loving, grateful, and cheerful all at the same time..Where are you ?.[Richie slams down phone]   Samantha: ""What happened?.If I only could, oh...

" The mood by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is happy. When the author talk about his or her memoirs it seemed like they felt happy having those memoirs to talk about. Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is..After humpin' your leg   they just leave you with flees and just split!.I don't want to be   A good time girl A good time girl      String you along like I string my pearls   A typical good time girl   A good time girl   A good time girl   A typical good time girl   I don't need no diamonds now   They'd seem like broken glass   I'd never wear a fur   Would seem like stepping into anothers skin   A typical good time girl like me      A good time girl   A good time girl   A typical good time girl (repeat)      A typical good time girl (repeat).I come one man, I come one man, I come one man   I come one man, I come one man, I come one man      Bunny girl, happy shopper..Well, there ain't nobody safer than someone who doesn't care..Hey Mike, Mike...MIKE!.Sitting in the cheap seats underneath   The stars   I'm heading back to base, I'll drop you off   At Mars   I'm sure I know your face or what star   You're from   I try to make conversation but I'm too   Far gone      I'm a man machine   Drinking gasoline   Super human being   Shooting laser beams      How you gonna leave, when your bags   Ain't packed   And how you gonna shoot, when we're   Back to back   How d'you tell a joke, when you can't laugh   You know that you're the punchline, baby   Take a bath      I'm a man machine   Drinking gasoline   Super human being   I'm a queen's dream      The dog has ate my homework today   It's not done, it ain't done   I have heard they're not very well   In the sun      Cos I'm a man machine   I'm a queen's dream   Drinking gasoline   I'm a queen's dream      Yeah....Help      How you gonna live for love lying on   Your back   And how you gonna keep it kleen in a   Dirty mac   How you gonna breathe when you're lost   In space   You're dazed and amused   Talking through a different face      Cos I'm man machine   Drinking gasoline   I'm a teen dream   I'm a man machine   I'm a man machine   I'm a man machine   Drinking gasoline.Hush hush, shh   Hush hush      I didn't mean to kiss you   You didn't mean to fall in love   I never meant to hurt you   We never meant for it to mean this much   Hush hush, now      I wanted to keep you   Forever next to me   You know that I still do   And all I wanted was to believe   Hush hush, now      So go on, live your life   So go on, say goodbye   So many questions   But I don't ask why   So this time I won't even try   Hush hush, now   Mmm, hush hush, now      When I try to forget you   I just keep on remembering   What we had was so true   And somehow we lost everything   Hush hush, now   (Hush hush, now)      So go on, live your life   So go on, say goodbye   So many questions   But I don't ask why, no   So go on, live your life   So go on, and say goodbye   So many questions   But I don't ask why   Maybe someday   But not tonight   Hush hush, now      Hush hush, now   Hush hush, now      Don't, don't, don't you ever say a word, word   Of what you ever thought you heard, heard   Don't you ever tell a soul   But you know   I tried to hide, but I still believe   We, that we were always meant to be, be   And I can't never let you go, no   Hush hush, now      So go on, live your life   So go on, and say goodbye   So many questions   But I don't ask why, no   So go on, live your life   So go on, and say goodbye   So many questions, but I don't ask why   Maybe someday   But not tonight   Hush hush, now, mmm   Hush hush, now, mmm   Hush hush,shh.Run around the trees!"
"The author created many feelings in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that the author's family celebrated life and created upbeat feelings. In conclusion, the author of the memoir created many feelings for the reader..These tormenting ghosts of yesterday,   Will vanish when exposed..[Verse:]   I paid my dudes   I made some money, living the dream and it's life that I made   I lost some friends, yeah life's been funny   But I don't regret any car that I paid   I thought I had it all   (I was wrong)   I thought I had everything I needed   But I wasn't true cuz I didn't have you   And now I have someone to believe in   And strong enough to offer something new   To the man that has everything   (The man that has everything)      [Verse 2:]   I face this world and move some mountains   Gather my strengh from the lessons I've learned   I lost my faith   I think god you found it and all that you asked is my love in return      I thought I had it all   (I was wrong)   I thought I had everything I needed   But I wasn't true cuz I didn't have you   And now I have someone to believe in   And strong enough to offer something new   To the man that has everything   (The man that has everything)      I thought I had everything I needed   But I wasn't true cuz I didn't have you   And now I have someone to believe in   And strong enough to offer something new   To the man that has everything   (The man that has everything).'Fore tomorrow comes creepin' in.....There on those days when the sun barely touches the sky   Your eyes are so heavy with the morning   And there you lie on the horizon of my mind   Streams flow through the consciousness of time   And I follow your every movement for a clue to you      You cover my eyes with your deepness   You wrap my soul in the beauty of it all   You take me away from my incompleteness   Lead me all the way or not at all   And times too precious here   I can't wait for clues to you   I can't wait for clues to you      Don't wake me if I'm dreaming, no, no, no, this is my reality   If I touch you tell me will you blow away   Please don't move now until you set me free - set me free      I can't wait for clues to you      Name the time and Ill be your place   Remove my eyes from this deathly haze   Now I've been living shades of blue and grey   Don't you know I'm ready for a brighter phase   And times too precious here   I can't wait for clues to you   I can't wait for clues to you      Wont you catch me if I fall too fast   Don't let me fly too high   Youve released me from my earthly grasp   And now youve got me in your skies - in your skies      I can't wait for clues to you   Now I don't want to wait anymore for clues      Let it rain   Let it wash on down      Can't wait for clues to you   I don't want to wait anymore for clues.MOVE ME   DUET BY CHER AND GREG ALLMAN      Move me   Love the way you move me, baby   Groove me   Love the way you groove me      Making love with you   Little things that you do   Make me feel so good inside      Oh oh do me   C'mon, c'mon, do me   Baby   Soothe me   Love the way you soothe me   I love I love I love I love I love I love   Love the way you do      Move me   Love the way you move me, baby   Groove me   Love the way you groove me      Making love with you   Little things that you do   Make me feel so good inside      I love, I love, I love the way you move me   Keep on, keep on doin' it   I love, I love, I love the way you move me   Keep on, keep on doin' it   I love, I love, I love the way you move me   Keep on, keep on, doin' it      [Fade out].Jimi:   ""yeah well a like I said before we only ran up a few numbers so let   Me try and do this one like we were just jammin' at the house we don't have   A name for yet it's just like an instrumental so we'll just go along with it..[Frank:]   I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie   All the day and night-time hear me sigh   I never had the least notion   That I could fall with so much emotion   [Barbra:]   I wonder...

"In the story Narciso Rodriguez the mood of the auther created was very peaceful. It was saying how it was a traditional cuban home and there was passionate cuban music that filled the air. There was also the mixing of the aromas in the air coming from the kitchen. There's tons of loving people around the house too. Which makes it home and comfertable. The mood was always happy and everyone loved to cook so they would always do that together even though they wernt blood related. ""Within the walls, my young parents created created our traditional cuban home, every heart of it was in the kitchen. As you can tell this family loves being together and enjoys eachothers company.I'm your turbo lover   Tell me there's no other   I'm your turbo lover   Better run for cover   On and on we're charging to the place so many seek   In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak   We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load   And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode..Hey, can you change your ways   Our love is such a treasure   Why do you run away   From things that give you pleasure      I love you all this time   On and on I've tried to work it out for the right day   In life you'll learn, you'll see   From birth, we start to die   Oh so fast, so near   There's nothing to lose   Nothing to fear      So little time to try   There's so much to know   Then to see the pain it shows   To get what you deserve   To reap what you sow   That's the way it goes      Why can't you change your ways   Why can't you change your ways   Why can't you change your ways.I remember it was that Wednesday   Oh when it rained and it rained   They traipsed mud all over the house   It took hours and hours to scrub it out   All over the hall carpet   I took my mop and bucket   And I cleaned and I cleaned      The kitchen floor   Until it sparkled   Then I took my laundry basket   And put the linen all in it   And everything I could fit in it   And all our dirty clothes that hadn't gone into the wash   And all your shirts and jeans and things   And put them in the new washing machine   Washing machine   Washing machine      I watched them go 'round and 'round   My blouse wrapping itself in your trousers   Oh the waves are going out   My skirt floating up around my waist   As I wade out into the surf   Oh and the waves are coming in   Oh and the waves are going out   Oh and you're standing right behind me   Little fish swim between my legs      Oh and the waves are coming in   Oh and the waves are going out   Oh and the waves are coming in   Out of the corner of my eye   I think I see you standing outside   But it's just your shirt   Hanging on the washing line   Waving its arm as the wind blows by   And it looks so alive   Nice and white   Just like its climbed right out   Of my washing machine   Washing machine   Washing machine      Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy   Get that dirty shirty clean   Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy   Make those cuffs and collars gleam   Everything clean and shiny      Washing machine   Washing machine   Washing machine.That's the story of, that's the glory of love..Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast   I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last   When you're up this high, it's a sad goodbye      Don't you wanna stay here a little while?.I preach the ways of Satan   Answer to his calls   I translate manuscripts   On ancient Latin scrolls   In my shrine, my avernus   I see the gates of Hell   Guarded well by Chronozon   Tortured souls do dwell   Satanachist   Satanachist   I mount the virgin Venus   Plague the blackened seas   I am the souls destructor   Marching without fear   The night is filled with souls   In coral exctasy   The saraband of death   Will always follow me   Satanachist   Satanachist   I bear the evil eye   Possess the unbidden   I'll bring your dead alive   And chew your flesh from bone   I stalk through life and death   With Gorgon for my gaze   I breath the immortal pain   Beware the human race   Satanachist   Satanachist.Black eyes, black sights, black magical rites Tonight, there comes a time, babe..All movement is accomplished in six stages   And the seventh brings return."
"In this article, the authors mood seemed to be happy and good. For example he likes that his parents are selfish and hard working people and tried to make his life happy. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. He also likes how they tought him things that they know how to do such as cooking. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit eser then how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried. His mood changed to be happy again when he menchened that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home..Baby, I'm just dyin' to please   Cry, cry, cry when you're singin' the blues   I'm just bringin' my sympathies      Hey, little mama won't you change your mind?.Everybody laughed and my inlaws too   Where were you when I turned around   Someplace you knew you never could be found   Whoa oh (whoa oh), give me back my ring (my ring), whoa oh (whoa oh)   Whoa oh (whoa oh), I ain't gonna let you keep a thing (a thing), whoa oh      Where were you when I searched the town?.One shot, one gun shot and bam   Hey Mister Arnstein, here I am!.I can't believe it, this love I've found   The fever's rising I can't cool it down   And just like the South, Girl, we're gonna rise again   Sharing a love that just won't end..I wonder why there's no tear in your eye..And don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not   Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught      [Chorus]      And the award for the best liar goes to you   For makin' me believe   That you could be   Faithful to me   Let's hear your speech out   Oh      How 'bout a round of applause?.But don't you   Step on my blue suede shoes   Well, you can do anything   But stay off of my blue suede shoes      Well, it's   Blue, blue   Blue suede shoes   Blue, blue   Blue suede shoes, yeah!.Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,   Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,   Never bein' able to separate the good from the bad,   Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,   It's makin' me feel so bad."
"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir..I can't sleep at night   And I can't even fight   I guess I'll never be free   Since you got your hooks in me..Jack Dempsey would start shakin'   All it's takin, is some marijuana and I'm makin'   MC's break fast like flapjacks and bacon   Backspins to windmill, who's still the gin drinker   Ill thinker - explodin when the paper hits the ink, uh   Take your gangsta chronicles.Shh....Remember, will you remember?).Can't forget about you..I'm being....Legalize it today   And get smoked out tonight.What's she like?"
"Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM2). Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere. The author says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir a passionate mood is displayed. .Wake alone in the hills   With the wind in your face   It feels good to be proud   And be free and a race   That is part of a

"The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it. Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped Immigrants who needed support..Many a month has come and gone   Since I've wandered from my home   In those Oklahoma hills   Where I was born      Many a page of my life has turned   Many lessons I have learned   And I feel like in those hills   Where I belong      Way down yonder in the Indian nation   Ridin' my pony on the reservation   In the Oklahoma hills where I was born      Way down yonder in the Indian nation   A cowboy's life is my occupation   In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born      But as I sit here today   Many mile's I am away   From the place I rode my pony   Through the draw      Where the oak and black-jack trees   Kiss the playful prairie breeze   And I feel back in those hills   Where I belong      Now as I turn life a page   To the land of the great Osage   In those Oklahoma hills   Where I was born      Where the black oil rolls and flows   And the snow white cotton grows   And I feel like in those hills   Where I belong.By now I'm not lookin' for love,   Just lookin' for tonight....Well I was born in a small town   And I live in a small town   Probably die in a small town   Oh, those small communities      All my friends are so small town   My parents live in the same small town   My job is so small town   Provides little opportunity      Educated in a small town   Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town   Used to daydream in that small town   Another boring romantic that's me      But I've seen it all in a small town   Had myself a ball in a small town   Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town   Now she's small town just like me      No I cannot forget where it is that I come from   I cannot forget the people who love me   Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town   And people let me be just what I want to be      Got nothing against a big town   Still hayseed enough to say   Look who's in the big town   But my bed is in a small town   Oh, and that's good enough for me      Well I was born in a small town   And I can breathe in a small town   Gonna die in this small town   And that's probably where they'll bury me.[Nicki Minaj]   Murder dem Murder dem aust one word body a third of them'   Kick kick game can't injure Nicki, that's why they nick nick named me Ninja Nicki,   I'm such a yes, and your a no no,   Live with a dragon, and wear a Kimono,   I'm from the Philliphines, badder than Billy Jean,   Is that why I get more head than a gulliten?.Yeah yeah!.Let's get there together,   Let's get there together,   Let's get there, sisters,   And let's get there, bothers,   Let's get there, let's get there,   Let's get there, let's get there..All the way down (Do you really want me?)"
"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author..Your palm..When I cross that bridge,   It'll be as if this don't exist..Mike!.My baby's gone   Tuesday's gone with the wind,   My baby's gone, gone with that wind   Long Gone (Gary)      (Pepper)   And I don't know, oh, where I'm goin'..""Let's meet contestant number one   He's a skitsofrantic, serial killer clown   Who says, ""woman love his sexy smile""   Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon   Sharon, what's your question?"".Look yourself in the eye before you drown..I know, I know, I know,   I know, I know, I know...   And I'd like to be the one to tell it so   After all is said and done   You wouldn't be satisfied with anyone   So after you get rid of me   Who will the next fool be?.In the shank of the night,   When the doins' are right,   Well you can tell 'em I'll be there."
" I think @CAPS1 mood in this @CAPS2 was @CAPS3 was @CAPS4 and glad @CAPS3 grew up with such good Parents and How There not self ish.You think you're so cool, hm?.If you offered me the heavens, I would have to turn away..Yeah that's right, my names bob,   The one who landed the popstars job..you took me away..Make a quick stop, serve 9 o's (these are my confessions)   I'm a sucker for clothes (ha ha!).Without you standing by my side   Love and good fortune passes me by   And you were my guiding light   It seemed so easy   When we said goodbye      How different would the world be now   If only we had worked it out somehow   What kind of fools are you and I   There would be stars up in the sky   If you were with me now      And I know I may go astray   But who's to say that we can't change our mind   My love burns stronger each day   If I'm sure of one thing      One love at a time   How could we throw our love away   When we had so much more than words can say   The darkest clouds would fade away   To bring the light into my day   If you were with me now      If loving you is right   Then turn back the hands of time   I'd do anything to make you mine   There'snothing that I wouldn't do   I could make you feel my love for you   If you were with me now   If you were with me now   If you were with me now.If the boy had been blessed, he'd have been arrested   On a charge of wearing red shoes   But if your pants are blue, you got nothing to lose   It'll make you a patriot through and through.What I'm I doing here   Who is this girl in my bed   What is this shit on my face   My God, what is that awful smell      [Chorus]   She may be an angel   She may be a queen   She might be black, white, American, Indian or Japanese   Through a bottle at a bouncer   Didn't think that he was cool   Pissed in someones drink   And through a bike into a pool      Driven down the side walk   Like a crazy possessed fool   I broke every single traffic rule."
" I think that the mood that the author created was a unpleasnt.

"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of appreciation + happiness. @CAPS1 does this by starting w/ background, + by the end moving to the lessons @CAPS1 learned from his parents.First, @CAPS1 describes how wounderful this enviornment was in paragraph @NUM1. ""My young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen... My parents passed on to me... a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air..."" @CAPS1 continues by describing how wonderful a place to grow up it was + how his parents showed him genorosity.Next, @CAPS1 says how hard it was for his parents to leave everything they knew, just for their children. In states in paragraph @NUM2, ""they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 continues by writing of how strong they were by showing him the value of family + friends + genorosity. This shows how apprecitive @CAPS1 was of them. Overall, by communicating this mood, @CAPS1 was able to honor his parents that much more..I always play to win, always seem to lose,   That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues..Oh holy night!.And then just watch it grow, don't you know?.We a army   Better yet a navy   Better yet crazy   Guns in the air   Guns in the air   Guns in the air      Can't hurt us again when you come around here   We got our guns, got our guns, we got our guns, got our guns   We got our guns in the motherfucking air, oh      I'm down for life   Gangsta for life   I'm down for life   Gangsta for life      [Chorus]      I lick the gun when I'm done   'Cause I know revenge is sweet.It's a little bit funny   This feeling inside   I'm not one of those who can   Easily hide      I don't have much money   But boy if I did   I'd buy a big house where   We both could live..It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,   Shines like the ring on your hand..Oh, daddy..I'll meet you half the way   Whoa yeah."
"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, it patrays the mood of Narciso home and relationship with his parents. The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful and cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home alive with Cuban food and music. Thats stating the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story it was hopefull they left Cuba and only lived in a @NUM1 room apartment but his parents were hopeful they would succeed. It was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place.

"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the author was feeling grateful and homesick. Narciso explains that he is grateful for his parents and what they did for him. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their own culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"".Today I took a walk in the clouds   Today I took a walk in the clouds   Used to keep my eyes wide shut, but now I'm staring down      Today I felt a switch in my vein   Today I felt a switch in my vein   Used to be a shadow now   A shadow scream my name   And in the daylight I could swear   We're the same      But I'm just an ordinary human (Ordinary ways)   I'm just an ordinary human   But I don't feel so ordinary today   I'm just a picture perfect nothing   Sometimes I medicate   I'll be a picture perfect human   Before the sun goes down today      Today I felt a switch in my vein   Today I made them all afraid   Used to be a shadow now   A shadow scream my name   And in the daylight I could swear   We're the same   But I'm just an ordinary human (Ordinary ways)      I'm just an ordinary human   But I don't feel so ordinary today   I'm just a picture perfect nothing   Sometimes I medicate   I'll be a picture perfect human   Before the sun goes down today      Just an ordinary human   But I don't feel so typical today      There'll be peace in the city tonight   Peace in the city tonight   But when I'm gone   I hope they get it right   There'll be peace in the city tonight   Peace in the city tonight   For when I'm gone   I hope they get it right      Just an ordinary human   (Ordinary ways)   I'm ordinary human   I don't feel so ordinary today      But when I'm gone   I hope they get it right.Lost direction..Good-bye to you   Charlotte Kringles too   I've had enough for one day.The world will pardon my mush   [Frank:] Yes, I have got a crush, my Barbra, on you!.Well I just can't say   Will I live tomorrow?.I don't give a fuck   Let the words that you say to me   Unless the actions sustain it   It's meaningless...

"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" made me feel like I was in their kitchen eating Cuban food, and listen to music. Also, he told the life of a cuban immigrant. My grandfather followed the same path. He was a young boy when his family immigrated from Cuba. But he worked his hardest and became a very succesful man. This story completely reminds me of him and since I have some background with this, I know this ""mood"" and it speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person. Finally, the mood he created shows that if you put your mind too it you could accomplish anything. Also, it shows the mood created in a typical cuban home..[Chorus]      Hurryin' to get there so you save some time..Overhead the albatross   Hangs motionless upon the air   And deep beneath the rolling waves   In labyrinths of coral caves   An echo of a distant time   Comes willowing across the sand   And everything is green and submarine..But I don't anymore..Days can be sunny   With never a sigh   Don't need what money can buy   Birds in the trees sing   Their day full of song   Why shouldn't we sing along?.Somewhere out there,   If love can see us through,   Then, we'll be together,   Somewhere out there, out where dreams, come true..Do you wish to be the one to understand?.Mike Shorey)      [Intro]   Fab... [5X]   Can you be my B-A-B-Y?.There'll be no strings to bind your hands   Not if my love can bind your heart   And there's no need to take a stand   For it was I who chose to start   I see no reason to take me home   I'm old enough to face the dawn      Just call me angel of the morning, angel   Just touch my cheek before you leave me, oh baby   Just call me angel of the morning, angel   Then slowly turn away from me      Maybe the sun's light will be dim   So it won't matter anyhow   If morning's echo says we've sinned   Well, it was what I wanted now   And if we're the victims of the night   I won't be blinded by the light      Just call me angel of the morning, angel   Just touch my cheek before you leave me, oh baby   Just call me angel of the morning, angel   Then slowly turn away   I won't beg you to stay with me   Through the tears of the day   Of the years, oh baby baby, baby baby      Just call me angel of the morning, angel   Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby   Just call me angel of the morning, angel   Just touch my cheek before you leave me   Oh baby, baby, oh baby"
"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON2, the mood is friendly. Anybody was allowed to stay at his house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents were ready to take anyone in because they knew they also would. Their community had a strong bond. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was life in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Getting with family and celebrating was the theme of their home. @CAPS1 loved and cared for each other in the neighborhood..Or maybe it's not that I'm afraid, it's just that the last move I made   Embarrassed me to death and made me want to hide..That with logic and love we'll have power enough,   To raise consciousness up and for lifting humanity higher..That child is gonna miss you,   You gonna wish that you were dead..But If I'm only dreaming, I sure don't want to wake,   'Cause I'm satisfied with you..When Charlie speaks of Lester   You know someone great has gone   The sweetest swinging music man   Had a Porkie Pig hat on   A bright star   In a dark age   When the bandstands had a thousand ways   Of refusing a black man admission   Black musician   In those days they put him in an   Underdog position   Cellars and chittlins'      When Lester took him a wife   Arm and arm went black and white   And some saw red   And drove them from their hotel bed   Love is never easy   It's short of the hope we have for happiness   Bright and sweet   Love is never easy street!.Hear the angels singing, what is that they say?.Seems there's someone special she's been meeting at the gym,   but the crazy thing about it, is that someone's not a him..Can't you see I'm tryin'   Can't you see I'm tryin'   Oh, why do you put me down   And leave me cryin'?"
"The author created a heartfelt mood in the memoir. The mood the author created was greatful mood. In the memoir it states ""skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" This quote make me feel grateful for my culture and heritage. This story also make me feel proud. In the story it states ""My Mother and father had come to this country with such courage"". I feel so proud that they wanted to leave to come have a better life. Lastly the mood is happy. This story is happy because he learns a good lesson and he pround of his parents and culture..Well I've tried and I've tried   But the river seems so wide   And my head hurts and my hands are tied   And it's so hard   When you're standing on the yard   Every time that your number comes around      [Chorus]   Call me up in dreamland   Radio to me man   Get the message to me   Any way you can   Let your river roll   Way down to your soul   Never to grow old   On a saxophone      From the airport to the plane   Way to the railroad train   Why don't we take it from the top   And start over all over again   Every time you hear that whistle blow   You know you gotta put on your show   Every time your number comes around      [Chorus]      From the car to the bar   Why don't you pour it in a jar   And put a label on it   And send it off to the lost and found   You gotta get it in your brain   Before you go insane   Every time your number comes around      [Chorus]   Never to grow old   On a saxophone   Never to grow old   On a saxophone   Never to grow old   On a saxophone.This is what the lonely heart must know..Only brokenhearted, life's not over   I can start again   While I'm lonely, brokenhearted   Its a hurting, thing to get over      I'm young but I'm wise enough to know   That you don't fall in love overnight   That's why I thought if I took my time   That everything in love would be right   Oh, oh      But as soon as I closed my eyes   I was saying to love ""good-bye""      [Chorus]   But I guess I'm only brokenhearted   Life's not over I can start again   While I'm lonely brokenhearted   Its a hurting thing to get over      No more empty conversations   Next time I will be totally sure, oh   Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love   Its more than my poor heart should endure      So I'll listen to all advice   And remember each time I cry      Chorus      Da, da, da, da, da-ha whoa..I set the trap and it was me who fell!.I love you, I want you for my own..Each time you break my heart   Each time you break my heart      I know how it feels to be the talk of the town   I'm not gonna let you go and run around   I need to know that you'll be true to me   'Cause that's the way it's got to be      Why can't you give your promise to me   Is love so blind that you cannot see   I'm trying hard not to walk out the door   Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no more      Chorus:      Each time you break my heart   I try to put my pride aside   Each time you break my heart   A little voice inside me cries      No matter what you do or say   I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway   And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind   How come you can't just walk away      In the beginning we were nothing but glad   Those were the best days that we ever had   There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone   Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on      [Chorus:]      Intermediate:      I see the look in your eyes   I know you're hurting inside   Let me try   To make you love me again   I'll say that I knew you when   You were mine   You were mine      Each time, oh, yeah      In the beginning we were nothing but glad   Those were the best days that we ever had   There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone   Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on      (intermediate)      [Chorus:]      Each time you break my heart again   Well I can say I knew you when [each time]   You were mine      Break my heart   Don't break my heart   (repeat and fade).If you're gonna do it, do it right - right?.Her cow, her cow   La, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la la, la, la, la La, la, la, la   A purty girl milking her cow!"
"In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy..[Chorus]      I was sick and tired, fed up with this   And decided to take a drive downtown   It was so very quiet and peaceful   There was nobody, not a soul around   I laid myself out, I was so tired   And I started to dream   In the morning the parking tickets were just - like a flag stuck on my window screen      [Chorus:Repeat x2].There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,   Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose..You should take some time to realise,   You're the only one I'm thinking of..He said, ""He who is not for Me is against Me,""   Just so you know where He's coming from..'Cause that someone just gave her to me..And we will all go together when we go..Everything else is alright sometimes..[and the ...]   Stand straight and true   [to help my friend and foe]   [Why let them ](Oh let them fight)   Fight your   Christ don't tell"
"In the memoir written by @PERSON1, he tells about how his parents immigrated from Cuba to The United States so that he could have a better life. He tells of how he will always be grateful for his Cuban culture that stayed with him his whole life, and for the selflessness of his parents. The mood that he sets in this memoir is gratefulness. When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, @PERSON1's family still found away to have a home. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave @CAPS1 a sense of family even though his real family was very far away. He is grateful for this because he will always have his cuban culture because that's what he was raised with. The overall mood he created was gratefulness..Oh down beside your red firelight   Oh and you give it all you got   Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round   Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round      Hey listen here   Now I got mortgages on homes   I got stiffness in ma' bones   Ain't no beauty Queens in this locality (I tell you)   Oh but I still get my pleasure   Still get my greatest treasure   Heap big woman you gonna make a big man out of me      Now get this   Oh (I know) you gonna take me home tonight (please)   Oh down beside that red firelight   Are you gonna let it all hang out ?.Come and face me like a man   Who nailed Him there?"".Come, let us all unite to sing:   God is love!.If we burn our wings   Flying too close to the sun   If the moment of glory   Is over before it's begun   If the dream is won   Though everything is lost   We will pay the price,   But we will not count the cost      When the dust has cleared   And victory denied   A summit too lofty   River a little too wide   If we keep our pride   Though paradise is lost   We will pay the price,   But we will not count the cost      And if the music stops   There's only the sound of the rain   All the hope and glory   All the sacrifice in vain   And if love remains   Though everything is lost   We will pay the price,   But we will not count the cost.Daddy was a part time farmer..[Verse 1]   I should've known when the cop told me I'm goin' too fast   He told me   Speed like that and it's bound to be a hell of a crash   He told me   Better late than you don't get there, do the math   Oh you oughta be grateful   For what you have      [Pre-Chorus]   Well what if I refuse to learn?.Everything gets out of hand..Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,   Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,   All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold."
"In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author..Written by don helms and hank williams   Recorded by ray price feb. 8, 1952, with the drifting cowboys      (d) you ask me why my (d7) hearts so (g) sad,   And (d) why the teardrops fill my (a7) eyes,   A (d) heart cant sing thats (d7) filled with (g) pain,   How (d) can it (a7) laugh when it (d) cries..Suffer suffer me this..Kind hearts don't make a new story..Way down in Louisiana amongst the tall grown sugar canes   Lived a simple man and a domineerin' hen and a rose of a different name   The first time I fell lightly I was standing in the drizzlin' rain   With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin and a rose of a different name   The devil made me do it the first time the second time I done it on my own   Lord put a handle on a simple handed man and help me leave that black rose alone      When the devil made that woman Lord she threw the pattern away   She was built for speed with the tools you need to make a new fool every day   Way down deep and dirty on the darker side of shame   You caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin with a rose of a different name   The devil made me do it the first time   The devil made me do it the first time.Anxiety, anxiety keeps me happy..Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore,      As the days disappeared far too soon..You are all the same   Go the way you came   Different names   But very little else has changed      Difficult to find   Easy to resign   Didn't seem to matter   When I didn't mind      Out before it's in   Everybody wins   Give them what they want   And they are giving in nothing in return      Will we ever learn?.Is it on and back again?"
"The mood created by the author overall is gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some events in his life you notice he mostly talks about his family. He says that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, what matters is love.Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacraficed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get.Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family. It saw what courage it took for his parents to turn the simple house they once had into a home for him..He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"".Here it come..for love   Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop      If loving you is wrong, babe   Oh, I don't want to be right   I've got you under my skin, babe   And baby, hold me tight   I'm ready for our romance   I wait a million years for you   I love you more than I'm saying   Baby, that's for me the truth.You've been talking in your sleep again..Watcher of the skies watcher of all   This is your fate alone, this fate is your own..But, I don't want no sympathy..All I hear is disgrace..Here come the bishop all dressed up   He's gonna bless you if you're ready to pay   One wave of his funny old stick,   There's a band of light across your eyes."
"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir was very positive and warm, showing gratitude, and promoting the real definition of family. An example of his gratitude towards his parents is when he states: ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Narciso describes his sense of true family in paragraph @NUM1 when he says: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso describes that his parents were very courageous coming to @LOCATION1 having no previous knowledge of the culture or language. He expresses how thankful he is for his parents to come to @LOCATION1, leaving everything they knew behind, in order to give him a better life. He describes his neighborhood being a true family, adding big dinners together, and helping one another in times of need ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done... I think them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood of the memoir truly does demonstrate the importance of family, love, warmth, and gratefulness..Traditional      Where is my tambourine wait a minute I'll get your tambourine   Got my

"This is the mood created by the author in this memoir. In this memoir the author states""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". One reason why this describes the author's mood is that it shows that through all the great times he's had with his family, they have giving him an experience of a life time that he will never forget. Another reason why this shows the author's mood is that now that his parents have died and he misses them the only memory he has of them is this house he calls home. That is how the author describes his mood a lot in this memoir..To really love a woman   To understand her, you gotta know it deep inside   Hear every thought, see every dream   N' give her wings, when she wants to fly   Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms   You know you really love a woman      When you love a woman you tell her   That she's really wanted   When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one   She needs somebody to tell her   That it's gonna last forever   So tell me have you ever really   Really really ever loved a woman?.Ayo quattro, trece, doce, uno   You know the boy give 'em more kicks than judo   You know I protect what's mine, that you do know   You know violating me you gon catch a fued-o   ?.Well I just got back from the liquer store,   I bought you some pink champaigne..No matter what you make   All that you can take   Is what you give away      You know it's not too late   It's all for Heaven's sake   What you give away   What you give away   What you give away.He was a monster,   Black, dressed in leather..When the truth isn't   Quite enough?.And on my way, I sing a song..No batter!"
"The mood created by the author is a grateful mood. It's grateful because the boy kept on talking about how thankfull he is for all the stuff he has. Another reason why the mood is grateful is because all of the people in the neighborhood will all come together and eat with eachother, visit with eachother, and help eachother. I know the mood is grateful because it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."".The question is not whether the freedom we've got   Is worth the consequence of war   The question is just, can I hold you at dusk   Without you asking me for more?.He is nowhere to be found..Dressed in dreams for me   You were what I wished to see   Elizabeth, Elizabeth   Love was very new   Make believe was coming true   Elizabeth, Elizabeth   You were all much too much   Out of reach and out of touch   When you came to me   I found it could never be   Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth   So a dream has to end   When it's real   Not pretend   Dressed in memories   You are what you used to be   Elizabeth, Elizabeth   Elizabeth.Don't you be Tarot-fied   It's just a token of my extreme   Don't you be Tarot-fied   It's just a token of my extreme      Don't you never try to look behind my eyes   You don't want to know what they have seen   Don't you never try to look behind my eyes   You don't want to know what they have seen      Joe:   Some people think   That if they go too far   They'll never get back   To where the rest of them are   I might be crazy   But there's one thing I know   You might be surprised   At what you find out when ya go!.Pull myself together, put on a new face..[Hook: x3].You're running on into a cold night..Traffic jam, been sittin' for a fuckin' hour   Must be an accident, I hope nobody died   Finally get there, and the crash is on the other side   The gawkers roll and they creep slow   Hoping they can see a mangled body show   Some park, and stand there and watch it all   With their kids, they point, and fuckin stare (and just look)   I remember one time I was pulled over   Handcuffed, the cop was like, show's over   People watching, hoping that he shoots me   I just wanted to choke the fucking head   [Chorus (2x)]   How many times will I ask myself why, how many times?"
"The tone of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was a happy one with many positive feelings, memories, and undertones mixed in. Rodriguez sets the mood in the @NUM1 paragraph when @CAPS2 describes the warm, inviting, and cozy feeling that was given off at his home. Here @CAPS2 describes how ""passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This gives off a warm, innocent vibe, staging the mood for the memoir @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM2, the mood is expanded so that it also encopasses the welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez says that his ""parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people [they] considered family"". Finally, this excerpt gives off a proud and graceful mood. This pride and gratitude from Narciso Rodriguez is directed toward his parents @CAPS2 uses many words like ""courage"", ""selflessly"", ""struggled"", ""braving"", and ""hardships"" to describe Rawedia and @PERSON2's actions with a proud undertone Rodriguez then talks about how grateful @CAPS2 is to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Then @CAPS2 goes on to talk about how deeply grateful @CAPS2 is towards his parents for all they did for him in great detail. The mood of this memoir is happy, welcoming, warm, grateful, and proud. that would make anyone yearn for the one place where they too felt this feeling circulating around them.You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss,   A sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply,   As time goes by      An' when two lovers woo, they still say ""I love you,""   On that you can rely, no matter what the future brings,   As time goes by      Moonlight an' love songs never out of date,   Hearts full of passion, jealousy an' hate,   Woman needs man and man must have his mate,   That no one can deny      It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory,   A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,   As time goes by      It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory,   A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,   As time goes by.(Interlude)      Anything   That upsets you   Send for me...send for me!.Who do I feel sorry for?.What I'm looking for is a sign   That you feel how I feel for you   Baby please don't let me go   Baby please don't let me go   Baby please don't let me go   No, please don't let me go   Baby no, no, no, no      Badabadeebaba   What else can I say?.And I've given away no secrets   Who's barmy now?.(hanh!).There ain't no use in cryin'..What can I say?"
"The mood created by narciso Rodriguez was appreciation, or that's what I got out of it. Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. ""I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them What they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done...""p. @NUM1. He closed it off with how he could never forget how his parents turned a house into a home, appreciation flowing strongly.Now to the next episode when we are back on the road and we are racing time and we are cracking the code..Yeah but that's what the people like to read about,   Up in America, up in America..I'm gonna love you the rest of my life..But now you are feeling strange..You're so extreme, you're super heavy   You're one step over the line   Not what you seem, don't try and tell me   I know what's really on your mind      Once you get started you're out of control   Don't play that sweet and innocent with me girl   I know you know you want to rock and roll   But I got just what you need      I, I want to feel your love   Too much is not enough   I, I want to feel your touch   Too much is not enough      You've got it bad, you're hopelessly addicted   You're always searching for the cure   Love is the crime, you stand convicted   You keep on coming back for more      Come on admit it, you're over the top   That song and dance won't work with me girl   You just can't quit it, don't know when to stop   But I got the remedy      I, I want to feel your love   Too much is not enough   I, I want to feel your touch   Too much is not enough      Baby stop wasting time   And let me know that you're mine   I need to feel your embrace   How much can I take.Reap from the turquoise sky, harlequin, harlequin,   Dancing round, three children fill the glade,   Theirs was the laughter in the winding stream, and in between..I pity the poor immigrant   Who tramples through the mud,   Who fills his mouth with laughing   And who builds his town with blood,   Whose visions in the final end   Must shatter like the glass..A list of exports from Cork Harbour   On a single day   The fourteenth of September, Eighteen Forty-Seven   Ran as follows:      147 barrels of pork,   986 casks of ham,   27 sacks of bacon,   528 boxes of eggs,   1, 397 firkins of butter,   477 sacks of oats,   720 sacks of flour,   380 sacks of barley,   187 head of cattle,   296 head of sheep, and   4, 338 barrels of miscellaneous provisions,   On a single day,   The ships sailed out from Cork Harbour   With their bellies in the water."
"The author gave the memoir the feeling of happiness, gratefulness, and the feeling of family. The memoir makes you feel like you are at the kitchen table, listening to Cuban music..I wanna know,   Why they sin,   In the garden of Eden..You love her, yes!.Now more than ever   With Heaven on our side      Can we give our love one more night?.[Kelly]   I can not find away   To describe it..I'm a regular listener of 'Pop Go the Beatles, '"" good lad, ""and,   Please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show..Paranoia strikes deep,   Into your life it will creep..Cause tennis shoes, and rhythm and blues   Are second generation   All across the nation, now,   And mama knows,   Papa too rock 'n roll is music,   Rock 'n roll is music, now..Nothing left to say."
" The mood in the memoir is peaceful and loving The reason why it is peaceful is because there is no fighting in this story at all. This story is loving because throughout the whole thing the only thing that I learned about was how to respect and love each other. There are many examples of this in paragraph @NUM1 and paragraph @NUM2. This is the tone of the story..No!.Judge not this race by empty remains   Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead?.Like bees with out the honey   Or a sun that isn't sunny   Eat a cookie without milk   I wouldn't   And it seems that you can't wear   Just one shoe you need a pair   Even if I wore them, Which I don't   I couldn't      Underneath the same sky   Even though you're not close by   It feels just like   We're right beside each other   Even though we're far apart   Our friendship fills my heart   It's so good to know   We're under the same sky      Every kind of game takes two   I can't play without you   I guess I better put my ball away now   Even Bouncing is not as funny   When you can't annoy your buddy   I'd fix things   If I just could figure out how      Underneath the same sky   Even though you're not close by   It feels just like   We're right beside each other   Even though we're far apart   Our friendship fills my heart   It's so good to know   We're under the same sky      (Harmonica)      Underneath the same sky   Even though you're not close by   It feels just like   We're right beside each other   Even though we're far apart   Our friendship fills my heart   It's so good to know   We're under the same   (Underneath the same sky)   So good to know we're under the same sky   (Underneath the same sky)   (Underneath the same sky)      Though my head is full of fluff   This much I know is true   It's lonely on my only   Without you.Im your child, and Im going to follow you,   No matter whatever the cost, Im gonna count all things lost..Way down the street there's a light in his place   You open the door he's got that look on his face   And he asks you where you've been   You tell him who you've seen   And you talk about anything..Then they say it publicly and say   Chocolate Rain!.If you never been by   How then could I   Begin to say      After all this time   And you're still a friend of mine   So I believe in someone   After all      After all this time   You're still a friend of mine   So I believe in someone   After all.Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him   If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again   Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian   A Muslim, sleeping with the Gin   Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in   Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?"
"A wonderful mood was created by Narciso Rodriguez, the author, in this memoir. While reading this story, I could feel the love, peace, & appreciation created by his words. Throughout the memoir, he really expands on the love & appreciation he feels for his parents. Paragraph @NUM1 states: ""I'll always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" Also, in paragraph @NUM2, he again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home. You can feel his awe & appreciation spilling out of his words. Also, the childhood home is described in paragraph @NUM3. Rodriguez describes the house's feeling as warm & elaborates on the things he's grateful to and will always love. The mood of this memoir is very specifically felt..Why worry so much?.The first time I met the blues   People, you know I was walkin' down through the woods   Yes, the first time I met the blues   You know, you know I was walkin' down through the woods      You stopped by my house first, Mister Blues   And blues, you didn't do me much good   You, should have heard me beggin'   Blues, don't murder me      Aw, you, you should have heard me begging   Mister blues, don't you murder me   You know, you be with me every morning, Mister Blues   I just got to know what you want with me      Ah, good morning, good morning, Mister Blues   I'd like to know what you're doing here so soon      Good morning, good morning, good morning   Good morning, good morning, Mister Blues   I wonder, I wonder what you're doin' here so soon      You'll be with me every morning, Mister Blues   You'll be here every night and every noon      Yeah, Mister Lenny Picket, ladies and gentleman   Let's give Len a big hand.You took me home   To your house..Crab man   I'm talkin' about de food I sells   When I done talkin' about de food I sells   Talkin' about devil crab..Said: ""hey, baby give it to me,"" all through the night..We're doing it for Itzpapalotlometeotlchiconahuiehecatl,   Errr?.Man's atomic age is here   Horrifying hordes appear   Exoskeleton armored, exoskeleton might   Exoskeleton horror, exoskeleton bite      Beware of them!.Can't say it's the money, no, so maybe it's the style."
"The mood in this memoir created by the author, was very peaceful and extremely loving. It was also a big thank you to his parents for everything they did for him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and Sacrifice."" The author is trying to get his point (of gratefulness) across to, not only the reader, but everyone in his life, but it seems that at some point he's lost for words. ""@CAPS1 often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the Spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The way the author explains everything puts you in the same mood is him. He seemed to feel the same peaceful, yet loving, and grateful mood flow over you as well. This is an amazing piece of work..Come on-a my house, my house, I'm-a gonna give you candy   Come on-a my house, my house, I'm-a gonna give you   Apple and a plum and an apricot or two, ah!.That baby couldn't stop shittin today!.Got to load up the reindeer, put on my red suit and go   I use to like Christmas, but every year it gets worse   Getting gift to six billion people is just too much damn work   Got the Christmas blues, man this job is killing me   And most of these stupid new houses don't even have chimneys   I use to be jolly, now I'm depressed   Had a twinkle in my eye, now I've got a bullet proof vest   'cause if the pace don't kill me, some gun totting yahoo will   They keep shooting at me like I'm some sort of big fat red criminal   Got the Christmas blues, I'm starting to see   That I gotta be some sort of loser to get paid in milk and cookies   I've grown to hate kids, especially their mail   Always asking me for stuff, well guess what I don't care, oh   Maybe I'm getting cranky as I get old   'cause I feel like giving them all a big lump of coal   Got the Christmas blues, man, enough is enough   Next year you can find some other sucker to deliver this stuff   Got the Christmas blues, I tell you I'm gonna quit   And find me a steady job with good benefits.From loneliness to a wedding ring..It wasn't really nothin'   I was just trying to have some fun   I let my guard down, I just turned 'round   Someone slashed me with a razor tongue   It's a strange situation   I'm not quite sure what it means   The one I admire, my simple desire   Smothered by a love gone green      Must be jealousy, must be cause it sounds like   Jealousy, must be 'cause it looks like   Jealousy, must be 'cause it smells like   Jealousy, must be 'cause it feels like   Eyes are drilling holes in the back of your head   Someone's got the number of your death bed, stepping into      Jealousy   You're ready for a comeback   You're back on your feet again   You think you're out from under   You hear a crack of thunder   Someone stabs you with a poison pen      If you try fightin' dirty   Just try to keep it clean   Cause no amount of trying and no amount of crying   Can save you from a love gone green   Must be jealousy   End of the dance and the loss of innocence   Jealousy drags me to my knees   Battered by a love gone green.'Til they hasten to my rescue, I shall scream..Saved by this parade of passion was my company   Gave my life for next to nothing a sane artillery   Is one that kisses 2 be clever, who is the enemy?.Change and be nicer?"
"The mood created by the author of the excurpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives in the memoir was love, happiness, and old memories of home. In paragraph seven it states ""... i celebrated my first birthdays. it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house..."" That shows how much he loved his home, even though it wasn't purfect. Also in paragraph four he say's ""..our landlords and his daughter Alegria-my first friend..."" Narciso's tell's about his first friend. But the tone that gives the best mood of the story is the memorie that Narciso's say's ""... i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home..."". In paragraph seven..Within the prison of my soul   Locked within my troubled mind   Is a love I can't forget   'Cause she's just one of a kind      Just a plain old fashioned girl   The kind a man don't have to tame   When he starts to settle down   He's proud to let her wear his name      Within my hand I hold the key   Do I dare to set her free   Got a feelin' in my mind   That she's just one of a kind      Pulled away from my hometown   Thought I'd leave her love behind   But Mary rode with me   On the highways of my mind      Seen a million pretty girls   Pretty girls aren't hard to find   But she's a rare breed, I'm convinced   Mary's just one of a kind      Within my hand I hold the key   Do I dare to set her free   Got a feelin' in my mind   That she's just one of a kind      Within the prison of my soul   Locked within my troubled mind   Is a love I can't forget   'Cause she's just one of a kind.You're just jealous cos God speaks ter me..Every day I spend with you, I call it lucky,   Every night we touch and speak the words of love..Every day is a new day   Since you went away   (Since you went away)   Since you went away from me   My whole life has made a change   (Made a change)   Every day's a new day and I see   It was best for you and me   Since you went away from me   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day   (Every day's a new day)   Since you went away from me   (Since you went away)   You were my comfort zone   I depended on you for everything   I wanted in my life, yes I did   But now that you're gone   I'm doing just fine without you   How I bless the day you went away   Now I have a song inside   (Inside)   The birds sing to me   I finally can be   Free to spread my wings in harmony   Now the sun shines on me   (On me)   I have been set free   To collect my thoughts and jot them down   All this happiness I've found   Since you've been away   Since you went away from me   My whole life has made a change   (Made a change)   Every day's a new day and I see   It was best for you and me   (It was best for you and me)   Since you went away from me   (Yeah)   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day   Since you went away from me   (Since you went away)   It may sound crazy, but I forgive you   And want the best for you   The circumstances came my way   Now I've learned to do for myself   And all the things I thought   That you would do for me   Like leaving me alone to go for my own   When you're not at home, I'm glad you're gone   Now I have a song inside   (Inside)   The birds sing to me   I finally can be   Free to spread my wings in harmony   Now the sun shines on me   (On me)   I have been set free   To collect my thoughts and jot them down   All this happiness I've found   (Since you went away)   Since you went away from me   (Since you went away)   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day and I see   (Everyday)   It was best for you and me   (Since you went away)   Since you went away from me   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day   Since you went away from me   (Since you went away)   Since you went away from me   (From me)   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day and I see   It was best for you and me   (How I bless that day)   Since you went away from me   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day   Since you went away from me   (Since you went away)   Every day   Since you went away from me   (From me)   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day and I see   (Every day)   It was best for you and me   (Every day)   (Since you went away)   Since you went away from me   (Yeah)   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day   Since you went away from me   Since you went away from me   (From me)   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day and I see   It was best for you and me   (It was best for you and me)   Since you went away from me   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day   Since you went away from me   (Since you went away)   Since you went away from me   (Since you went away)   My whole life has made a change   Every day's a new day and I see   It was best for you and me   (It was best for you and me)   Since you went away from me   (Yeah)   My whole life has made a change   (Since you went away)   Every day's a new day   Since you went away.Is this all necessary?.And how far must they go, to prove to you?.My life a wreck you're making   You know I'm yours for just the taking   I'd gladly surrender myself to you   Body an' soul!.(Matilda,   Matilda,   Matilda, she take me money and run Venezuela.)"
"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive one. The author tells how his parents immigrated from Cuba in 1956 and how he was born in 1961. He never said one negative thing about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey. He mentioned how his parents had a love for cooking and that love was passed down to him. He said that he was grateful for that. He also mentioned that, along with the cooking, was Passionate Cuban music. He described his neighborhood as being made up of ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" As a final sentence, the author stated how we ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."".He's a fine figure of a man and handsome too   With his eyes upon the secret places he'd like to undo   Still he knows who knows who and where and how   And I hope you're happy now      He's got all the things you need and some that you will never   But you make him sound like frozen food, his love will last forever   Still he knows what you want and what you don't allow   And I hope you're happy now      I hope that you're happy now like you're supposed to be   And I know that this will hurt you more than it hurts me      He's acting innocent and proud still you know what he's after   Like a matador with his pork sword, while we all die of laughter   In his turquoise pajamas and motorcycle hat   I hope you're happy now because you'll soon put pay to that   I knew then what I know now I never loved you anyhow   And I hope you're happy now.It was you who walked into my life   You were the one   You hear my cries of loneliness   Through my cool cautious eyes   Can't you see me reaching out for you   Can't you feel me there   Wont you please believe me   I could never touch you for the fear   That I might never let you go      It was you with the courage and the commitment   To start your new life   You make me believe in mine   But can't you see the confusion   Through my troubled smile   I'm torn between losing me   Losing me and gaining you      Maybe I've been distant   Maybe I've been cold   But I've done it for my own existence   And I do believe I do believe its getting old      I might never say that I love you   I might never say I care   But I will tell you now   That Ill always be there.Thistlehair the Christmas bear   Spreadin' the good news everywhere....My love is the lasting kind so you   Better come and take it..She'll be right here in my arms   So in Love   She'll be right here in these arms   She can't let go   She can't let go      So hard she's trying   But her heart won't turn to stone, oh no   She keeps on crying   But I won't leave her alone   She'll never be alone      She'll be right here in my arms   So in Love   She'll be right here in these arms   She can't let go   She can't let go   She can't let go   She can't let go   She can't let go   She can't let go   She can't let go.And I would give anything..We were just two kids in high school   Who'd never been in love before   Just happened to be together   We never wanted more   We had one long crazy summer   Life was like a honeymoon   But we couldn't hold back our feelin's   Guess you came along too soon      Ooh, darlin'   I think we fell in love too fast   Ooh, darlin'   I think we fell in love too fast      I was workin' my way through college   When you wrote and told me the news   Said you were gonna have a baby   Yeah, I knew my college days were through   Had to work late to make the money   You saw more of the kid than me   I guess I knew I failed you when   You said that you'd rather be free   You wanted to be free      Ooh, darlin'   I think we fell in love too fast   Ooh, darlin'   I think we fell in love too fast      Well I heard you got away to Florida   Got a husband, took the kid   I bet they think the whole world of you   Just like I always did   You were the only one I ever wanted   But I know you can't be replaced   If only we'd met a little later, babe   We wouldn't of made the same mistakes      Oh, no, no, no, ooh   Darlin', yeah   I think we fell in love too fast   I know it now   Ooh, darlin', darlin'   I know we fell in love too fast, too fast   Ooh, darlin', yeah   I think we fell in love too fast   I know it now   Ooh, darlin', darlin'   I know we fell in love too fast, too fast.Can't keep a good thing down,   You can't keep a good thing down."

"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" the mood created by the author is that his parents were loving and caring. His parents were loving and caring because they made their house into a home. His parents were selfless and caring when they come to the United States. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This shows his parents were loving and made sacrafices for their children to have a good life. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""they struggled both personally and financially"". This shows they cared about their family because they sacraficed things to struggle & make their family happy. In conclusion, the mood is being caring and loving..Hey, America   Let's turn it up   Yeah check out ourselves   Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile      Your clothes may be Chanel, Gucci   Your shoes crocodile   But baby you're never fully dressed without a smile      And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all   We got all we need, got no more   You're never fully dressed without a smile   And if you stand for somethin' you can have it all   If it's real, you'll open every door   You're never fully dressed without a smile   You're never fully dressed without a smile   You're never fully dressed without a smile      Ready or not, give all we've got   Yeah you can't deny   That baby you're never fully dressed without a smile   Don't sink the boat when you lose hope   I keep you alive   But baby you're never fully dressed without a smile      And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all   We got all we need, got no more   You're never fully dressed without a smile   And if you stand for somethin' you can have it all   If it's real, you'll open every door   You're never fully dressed without a smile   You're never fully dressed without a smile   You're never fully dressed without a smile      Now look at us   We pick it up   We set it on fire   Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile   We show it out   We're playing now   We're living the life   But baby you're never fully dressed without a smile      And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all   We got all we need, got no more   You're never fully dressed without a smile   And if you stand for somethin' you can have it all   If it's real, you'll open every door   You're never fully dressed without a smile   You're never fully dressed without a smile   You're never fully dressed without a smile.Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow..], oh      We are shadows and portraits   Empires of life and clay   Images of our maker   Sinners called out as saints      [Pre-Chorus]   [Chorus]x2      [Bridge]   No eye has seen   No ear has heard   No mind conceived   What heaven holds   But here and now   Let earth be found   With all our crowns upon your name      [Long instrumental break]      [Bridge].I gave my heart so easily..Lightning struck the magic purse   I didn't do a damn thing, man!.They seek him here, they seek him there,   His clothes are loud, but never square..The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious   Our police and detective are furious   'Cause they can't find the source   Of this lethally evil force   This is serious, so give me a quarter   I was a witness, get me a reporter   Call April O'Neil in on this case, and   You'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste   We need help, like quick, on the double   Have pity on the city, man it's in trouble   We need heroes like the lone ranger   When tonto came pronto, when there was danger   They didn't say they'd be there in half an hour   'Cause they displayed   Turtle power   T-you-are-t-l-e power   T-you-are-t-l-e power   T-you-are-t-l-e power   Teenage mutant ninja turtle   T-you-are-t-l-e power   T-you-are-t-l-e power   T-you-are-t-l-e power   Teenage mutant ninja turtle   Now, our miss reporter was hot on the trail   Determined to put these crooks in jail   She spied the bad guys and saw what happened   But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and got caught   Yeah, she was all alone   With no friends and no phone   Now, this was beyond her worst dreams   'Cause she was concerned by some wayward teens   Headed by shredder, they were anything but good   Misguided, unloved, they called them, the foot   They could terrorize and be angry youth, and   They mugged the people who needed proof?.I've a wonderful way of saying adieu,   And everything I've got belongs to you."
" The mood in this memoir is very relaxed and proud. The author showed that he was so proud of his parents and his culture. He talked with a relaxed feeling and loving everything about his home and culture. Also the mood is so grateful. He is so grateful of his neighbors and how they all came together. Also he was grateful to have his family and friends in his apartment. The author was just so proud of his life and parents..Been lucked out   Broke a woman's heart   With only myself to blame   Fate ran it's course   I suffered a loss   I learned a lesso in pain      Cheated, lied   I took love for granted   Oh, I paid the price   I won't last a night   I won't make the same mistake twice      Once Is Enough, it's one time too many   The changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough      Love went trough such sudden change   Taken a turn for the worst   The joy turned to fear   The pain got so severe   Lord, I thought I was cursed      Get what you give   It comes around full circle   Oh, I paid the price   Love so fast   I won't make the same mistake twice      Once Is Enough, it's one time too many   Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough   Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough.(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)   Ain't nuthin' I wouldn't do,   (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)   All and everything for you,   (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhoo)   Your love's all I know and ever knew,   Therefore, I have sold my soul for you..That girl sitting over there is defined as the world's finest Paramount Pyramid..What's your problem?.No shadow   No stars   No moon   No care   November   It only believes   In a pile of dead leaves   And a moon   That's the color of bone      No prayers for November   To linger longer   Stick your spoon in the wall   We'll slaughter them all      November has tied me   To an old dead tree   Get word to April   To rescue me   November's cold chain      Made of wet boots and rain   And shiny black ravens   On chimney smoke lanes   November seems odd   You're my firing squad   November      With my hair slicked back   With carrion shellac   With the blood from a pheasant   And the bone from a hare      Tied to the branches   Of a roebuck stag   Left to wave in the timber   Like a buck shot flag      Go away you rainsnout   Go away, blow your brains out   November.I want you I want you to stay   But I guess that it just can't be that way   You said that you'd be true   Baby said that you'd be true   I don't care, I don't care   I don't care, I don't care   I don't want you...

"The mood created by the memoir is greatfulness. I think this because this is one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful. (paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2 he also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's memoir states all the things he is grateful for this is why I believe greatfulness is the mood of this passage.If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I don't want to go   If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I'd just as soon stay home   If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I don't want to go   If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie, I'd just as soon stay home   If they don't have a Grand Ole Opry, like they do in Tennessee,   just send me to hell or New York City, it would be about the same to me..Just like myself they are neglected,   Turn with my eyes to the wall   What am i supposed to do now?.And the wind blows hot and the wind blows cold   But it blows us good so we've been told   Music's food 'til the art-biz folds   Let them all eat culture..And I'm movin', cleanin' out my closet   And I'ma get rid of all of this   All of what you left in here   Uh, you've been officially evicted   Cause you just don't get it   So let me make it nice 'n' clear   Baby no more games   Love and respect and truthin'   You must learn, learn      But a loss in love is a lesson learned..I don't know how to breathe   I don't know how to leave You   I don't know what to say   And who am I to say it anyway?.(yeah)   Did you read my love letter?.Your mean teetotum spins arouse your seventh wife   Who pats her sixty little skins   And re-insures your life,   Whilst you sulk in your sauna   'cause you lost your jigsaw corner   Playing Indoor Games, Indoor Games..Well the men said he was dying,   And the nausea and the pain left him wasting away   And unable to keep a meal down."

After his parents imigrated from Cuba, Narciso was very greatful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (para. six). Narciso believes in his Cuban heritage a lot. when coming to @LOCATION1, his neighborhood was full of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants. All of which he considered his family. He was grateful for the life, friends, and family support his family has given him. His parents had shown him with their lives, and these teachings has been the basis of his life. Narciso is greatful for coming to @LOCATION1 and bringing his old home in Cuba to his new home in @LOCATION1. .[Mr. Bumble]   Yes, you do!.I believe that someone in that great somewhere   Hears every word   Every time I hear a newborn baby cry,   Or touch a leaf   Or see the sky,   Then I know why I believe..Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop   Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop   Six fo' five was the time on the clock,   When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot..Oh, oh   Yeah, yeah yeah      How can I refuse your body laying next to me   I wanna know if you see the same thing that I see   Listen baby   Laying right here in your bed is where I wanna be   Making love to your body with your body on top of me      [Chorus]   Oh, how I wanna love you babe   Just like this, just like this   Oh, how I wanna touch you babe   Just like this, just like this   Oh, how I wanna feel you babe   Just like this, just like this   Oh, how I wanna love you babe   Just like this, just like this      I wanna try something new baby   That we never tried before   I wanna do something to you babe   Wait a minute, come back here on the floor   Oh tell me how do you like Mr. Bigg's cashmere rug baby   Does it feel good to your body baby   Make you feel right      [Chorus]      Oh, keep on pushing babe   Don't stop now   Slow it down   Make it go round and round   And round and round and round   It's time to go down   Don't stop what you doing babe cuz   I'm going down      [Chorus].Would you say no if I asked you for your hand   Could you believe in the same words that I don't understand   And would you cry if I told you I must go      [Chorus:]      I've been waiting such a long, long time, I think I could stand you forever   I've been wanting you a long, long time, I think I could stand you forever      Would you say no if I asked you for this one chance   Am I a fool to believe that this night is circumstance   I wish that for once you could see the look in your own eyes      I think I could stand you forever   Think I could stand you, think I could stand you forever, yeah   Think I could stand you forever, yeah - I think I could stand you   Think I could stand you forever, yeah - forever and ever   Think I could stand you forever, yeah   Think I could stand you forever and ever and ever.It took you leaving me   For my blind eyes to see that you mean..Was you ever in Quebec launching timber on the deck ,where ya   Break a bleeding neck riding on a donkey..Mick say's that he can never get no satifaction   These day's I think I know exactly what he means   What does he mean?"
"The @CAPS1 sets a good mood in this memoir about his house.the @CAPS1 states the house is a sign of life and love. The @CAPS1 states, ""always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love."" The @CAPS1 explains the mood by a Cuban feast. Also when he learns that in the neighborhood there is love to. The @CAPS1 states, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The @CAPS1 shows how many cultures and countrys show satisfaction in the whole neiborhood that is filled with mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1. The @CAPS1 shows a good positive, and geneorus mood in the book that has all started in the kitchen with a Cuban feast..Baby, you don't have to take the fall..""Merry Christmas everybody!.Why we should be on dead end street..I realize that this Line is dead,   So I'll follow you instead..Why do you insist on living the lifeling out of me?.Help, I have done it again   I have been here many times before   Hurt myself again today   And the worst part is there's no one else to blame      [Chorus]   Be my friend, hold me   Wrap me up, unfold me   I am small, and needy   Warm me up, and breathe me      Ouch, I have lost myself again   Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found,   Yeah I think that I might break   Lost myself again, and I feel unsafe      [Chorus: x2].Gone fishin' (keep it shady, I got me a big one staked out)   Mmm, you ain't workin' anymore (I don't have to work, I got me a piece of Gary)   Cows need milkin' in the barn (I have the twins on that detail, they each take a side)   But you just don't give a darn (give 'em four bits a cow and hand lotion)   You just never seem to learn (man, you taught me)   You ain't got no ambition (you're convincin' me)      Gone fishin' (bah-boo-dah-do-dah-do-dah-do)   Got your hound dog by your side (that's old Cindy-Lou goin' with me)   Gone fishin' (mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)   Fleas are bitin' at his hide (get away from me boy, you bother me)      Mmm, folks won't find us now because   Mister Satch and Mister Cros   We gone fishin' instead of just a-wishin'   Bah-boo-baby-bah-boo-bah-bay-mmm-bo-bay   Oh yeah!.Don't the sun look good   Goin' down over the sea?"
"The mood set in this memoir by the author, was greatfullness, and it seemed to be thanking his Family for such a loving childhood. It also seems @CAPS1 misses it. ""I was born into this simple house"" @CAPS1 says ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 was very comfortable in his home and @CAPS1 loved it. It seems as thogh the excerpt was made to thank those who @CAPS1 lived with. As it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 the excerpt @CAPS1 explains how caring, and generous his family and neighbors were."" My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author tells about his neighbor making delicious meals all the time, and their dinner table consisted of many neighbors, and blood relatives. The author had a very close relationship with his neighbors..I watched as you packed up your things..Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight   Split like a cord of wood my family broke up   Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow   A breathing piece of shit      Picked for my age, for my strength and make up   Called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up   A tree or a piece of steel I could do   What my fat owner can't      Ah, future farmers of America   Future farmers of America   Future farmers of America      Ah   I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over   I have a sex twice as big as her husband's   If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale   I'd disappear under a bush   Colorless men and ladies of the world unite   Kill your master with one cut of your knife   Kill them during sex, kill them during talk   Kill them whenever you can      Future farmers of America   Future farmers of America   Future farmers of America      These -   Stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart   Look at me, I'll never own land that I work on   Every one of us here shares a surname   This father must die      I was born on the dark cusp of twilight   My father was dark, my mother was light   Look at me, I'm strong   I could crush him in my fist      Ah   I could crush him in my   I could crush him in my   I could crush him in my fist      I could crush him in my   I could crush him in my   I could crush him in my fist      Future farmers of America   I could crush him in my fist   Future farmers of America   I could crush him in my fist   Future farmers of America   I could crush him in my fist.Don't have kids when you get grown..Scared of losing all the time   He wrote it in a letter   He was a friend of mine   He heard you could see your future   Inside a glass of water   With ripples and the rhymes   He asked ""Will I see heaven in mine?"".I'm goin', I'm goin', I'm goin'..You get a line and I'll get a pole, Honey,   You get a line and I'll get a pole, Babe..I climb up, spending daylight   Slide down drunken on the other side   Some sweet girl, playing my wife,   Runs off with a boy whose bike she'll ride      Playground (it's a playground)   Marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies in the   Playground (it's a playground)   Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square world      Bells will ring, door flings open   Hare and greyhound in the old kiss chase   You've been caught, game has ended   Smack on kisser from her slap on face      Playground (it's a playground)   We're marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies in the   Playground (it's a playground)   Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square world      Watch the leaves all tear away (one by one)   Leaving you but lined like an exercise book   What did your report once say (know the one)   This boy must try harder to please   From down on his knees      Playground, playground, playground, playground, playground,   Playground, playground, playground      Brain gets bent, heart gets broken   You can't jump off once the page is turned   School is out but never over   That's the only lesson you can learn      Playground (it's a playground)   We're marked by the masters and bruised by the bullies in the   Playground (it's a playground)   Never stop rehearsing, rehearsing for the big square      Playground (it's a playground)   Go for the high jump if you let 'em push you in the   Playground (it's a playground)   There's no escaping, escaping from their big square world      You may leave school, but it never leaves you.See that girl with the red dress on,   She can do it all night long,   She's a bad girl, she's a bad girl."
"The mood created in this memoir was manily for me family and Love. for most of the memoir the author was talking about exprens he had in the house, and the love he had's for his family and frend's. The first example I have for the mood is when he say's ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that ""family"". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit.

[Chorus]   Where there will be no more pain   No more sorrow   No more waiting   For illusive tomorrows   There will be no more pain   No more dying   No more striving or strain   No more pain      My mind's eye remembers the trouble I've seen   All I have been through,   And how I long to be free   But I learn by her patience that I need her resolve   To wait for the opening of eternity's halls   And I know that in time we will stand side by side   When Jesus comes back receiving his bride      [Chorus 3X]      No more pain.Oh, I...I do   Oh, I do   Oh, I do   Oh, I do.I'll soon be with you my love,   To give you my dawn surprise..She is so beautiful, portrait of a sunset..Tears will be the chaser for your wine   You sit there and tell me how you'd like to be free   You're tired of bein' tied down to a home and family   You say you miss the bright lights along the great white way   Little do you realize the price you have to pay   Tears will be the chaser for your wine after you leave this love of mine   Bright lights and taverns that's where you'll spend your time   And tears will be the chaser for your wine   [ dobro ]   Before you make up your mind you really want to go   Stop and think it over there's something you don't know   When the part is over then what will you do   When you wanna come back there'll be no place for you   And tears will be the chaser....I wasn't there when he hurt you, so why should I   Have to pay, let me in your life."
"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative. loving is what they did most because they basicly called everyone thier family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life. A example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved"". This shows they care about thier kids. One last mood is appreciative. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start thier life over. These are the moods that was created by the author..One way in and one way out   You don't know what it's all about   You look to the left   You look to the right   The brightest day and the darkest night      [Chorus]   And if you see me stealin' away   You better believe that I'd much rather stay   Daughter of the night   Everything right   Is getting to you baby   Sister of the sun   Born on the run      Just let me move you baby   On the road well I been told   The people need a highway code   The harder the chase   The sweeter the catch   I ain't the driver but you met your match      [Chorus]      You can win and you can lose   Listen mama you got to choose   You can give up tryin'   Or break down cryin'   Or keep on goin'   Change your mind      [Chorus].Come to me,   Baby, you'll see..(What's it gonna be?).Let me prove my love girl, I'll make you proud..Who wears a long cap on his head?.Midnight, on the water   I saw the ocean's daughter   Walking on a wave she came   Staring as she called my name      And I can't get it out of my head   No, I can't get it out of my head   Now my old world is gone for dead   'Cause I can't get it out of my head      Breakdown on the shoreline   Can't move, it's an ebbtide   Morning, don't get here tonight   Searching for her silver light      And I can't get it out of my head   No, I can't get it out of my head   Now my old world is gone for dead   'Cause I can't get it out of my head      Bank job in the city   Robin Hood and William Tell   And Ivanhoe and Lancelot   They don't envy me   Sitting 'til the sun goes down   In dreams the world keeps going 'round and 'round      And I can't get it out of my head   No, I can't get it out of my head   Now my old world is gone for dead   'Cause I can't get it out of my head.You understand..Hiciste me."
