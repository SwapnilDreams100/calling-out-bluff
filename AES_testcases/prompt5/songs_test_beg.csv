What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents. ""I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the besis of my life. What I mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him. The mood in this memoir is grateful because he love and cherrishes and cares about his mom and dad."
"I was on my way to nowhere..Chorus: (repeat chorus)      I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon   I relied upon the moon and St. Christopher to be my guide..She said she wanted more of that stuff   The stuff that makes your heart your heart go pitter-pat   The stuff that makes everything turn blue and green   She said that she prefers it like that   Give it up   Give it uh-uh-up   Give it up   Hey   Up up up up up up up   Give it up   Ha ha ha   Give it up   Up up up up up up hey   She said the one in the gas he used to be   So many people starving and fighting   Too many salesman   Too many batteries   Says she likes getting high cos it's free   Give it up   Give it uh-uh-up   Give it up   Hey   Up up up up up up up   Give it up   Ha ha ha   Give it up   Hey   Up up up up up up hey   (g-g-g-g-give it up)   Ha ha hnnn   Give it up   Give it uh-uh-up   Give it up   Hey   Up up up up up up up   Give it up   Ha ha haaa   Hey.You took away all my self-confidence..I decline   To walk the line   They tell me that I'm lazy   Worldly wise   I realize   That everybody's crazy   A woman's voice reminds me   To serve and not to speak   Am I myself or just another freak      Don't you know   There's fire in the hole   And nothing left to burn   I'd like to run out now   There's nowhere left to turn      With a cough   I shake it off   And work around my yellow stripe   Should I hide   And eat my pride   Or wait until it's good and ripe   My life is boiling over   It's happened once before   I wish someone would open up the door      Don't you know   There's fire in the hole   And nothing left to burn   I'd like to run out now   There's nowhere left to turn.When I was stranded came your helping hand   Lonely, hurt I had not known which way to turn   'Til you said, ""Try smiles, not tears, just laugh and learn""      I'm pulling trough and it's because of you!.From Mandeville to slide-a-ville.behind me theres too much money in front of me      [Chorus]. The mood created by the author was happiness. Because every one came together as a family and they look out for each other when they were in need. They also helped each other out and were kind and friendly."
"Serious as cancer..Who can tell you why?.You slip out of your depth and out of your mind   With your fear flowing out behind you   As you claw the thin ice..There's a high flyin' bird, way up in the sky   And I wonder does she looks down, as she flies on by?.Hey, what d'ya say?.Say you'll survive   Down Endless Street   Down Endless Street   Down Endless Street      Well say you'll be fine   When you walk out that door   Oh, will it be that easy   To see me no more?.I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees   Down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees   I said, 'I'm beggin' for mercy, [Incomprehensible] if you please?"".They say I'm better off now   Then I ever was with her   As they take me to my local down the street   I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet      They say a few drinks will help me to forget her   But after one too many I know that I'm never   Only they can see where this is gonna end   But they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense      [Chorus]   And my mates are all there trying to calm me down   'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town   I'm swearing if I go there now   I can change her mind turn it all around   And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words   And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred   Dialed her number and confessed to her   I'm still in love but all I heard   Was nothing      So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences   I know if I faced her face, that she'll come to her senses   Every drunk step I take leads me to her door   If she sees how much I'm hurting, she'll take me back for sure      [Chorus]      She said nothing   Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing   Oh, I got nothing   Oh, I got nothing   Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing      Oh, sometimes love's intoxicating   Oh, you're coming down, your hands are shaking   When you realize there's no one waiting      Am I better off dead?.In the memoir the author created a mood by using details about the setting and the chareters, one of the mood that was in the story is friendship. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not."" The author is explaining that he had family friends over to his house to eat almost every night. Another mood that is in the memoir is careing. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This shows that even though the authors family had a small home they let people stay with them untill they could leave. The last mood in the memoir is happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, it says ""I celebrated my first birthdays. Mood it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast alwase filled the air."" The author explains how he had his birthday with his friends and family. These are only three of the main moods in the story."

It goes up and down. At the beginning of this story, it was quit deppressing. It's basically just Rodriguez describing the crummy quarters he lived in. But, as the story progresses, it is filled with happiness and even though living conditions werent all that great, he still had fun. In the end, home is about relationships rather than physical space."
"..Written by: - (Traditional) Arranged by Garth Brooks      God rest ye merry gentlemen   Let nothing you dismay   Remember Christ our savior   Was born on Christmas day   To save us all from Satan's power   When we were gone astray   Oh tidings of comfort and joy      From God our heavenly father   The blessed angel came   And unto certain shepherds   Brought tidings of the same   How that in Bethlehem was born   The Son of God by name   Oh tidings of comfort and joy   Oh tidings of comfort and joy      Fear not said the angel   Let nothing you affright   This day is born a savior   Of the pure virgin bright   To free all those who trust in him   From Satan's power and might   Oh tidings of comfort and joy      And when they came to Bethlehem   Where our dear savior lay   They found him in the manger   Where oxen feed on hay   His mother Mary kneeled down   And to the Lord did pray   Oh tidings of comfort and joy   Oh tidings of comfort and joy      God rest ye merry gentlemen   Let nothing you dismay   Remember Christ our savior   Was born on Christmas day.""Calling earth!.How pain is so close to ecstasy..And on that night it has been told   These humble beasts so rough and rude,   Throughout the noght of holy birth   Drank no water, ate no food..Make me stop   I don't know   If I can do that on my own      I just like kissing your lips   My darling girl   I know that's not what love is   So why can't I   Keep mine and you keep yours?.Well, I woke up this morning a long about dawn..They wanne be   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   LOAF...loaf      They wanne be   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   LOAF...loaf      They wanne be   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   Feedin' 'em   LOAF...loaf. The mood from my perspective would be a calm and cozy sentimental feeling. When the author would talk about how his parents passed so many feelings and so much culture it made me think about who I am and where I am from. It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and I can relate to that. It gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in.  It made me feel strong and inspired my the mother and father's dedication to family."

The mood in this memoir is heritage love and family love. This is showed by the author when he writes about his home and how we learn to love there. All the friendships he had and family moments made him love his home. He show the warmth and love for his family and home."

I think the mood in this story was sad/happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook  And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook.  Also In paragraph @NUM1 Its a paragraph dedicated to his parents. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good Jobs but when they came to the united states they had to startover."

The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate. Also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out. He also considers his community family and that really makes you feel at peace inside."

The author still listens to Cuban music when he does cook."

Narciso speaks of his childhood home with only love and affection. @CAPS1's eternally grateful to his parents for turning ""... this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 speakes admirably of his parents and the sacrifices and hard work they went through to even get to @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 is so thankful they did. @CAPS1 also speakes lovingly of his ""extended family"" and describes his neighborhood. ""In our neighborhood..., all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

"Now I've told you who she was,   And I've told you what she does,   Still, give this gal her dues..Oh the the night is so still, not a baby will cry   Not a chill wind will blow, disturbing the sky   But there's no peace in me, I'm burning for you   I'm walking the floor in the devil's shoes..Will it go on forever?.If you got nine lives, you might survive   'Cause nothing's free on the other side      [Chorus]      Wheelin', dealin', cheatin', stealin'   Just to stay alive   They got love for sale, yes, for sale   On the New York subway line   Watch the working girls hanging out   Turning tricks underneath the lights   The lights      One step from Hell   The poor men sell their soul   For a taste of wine      [Chorus]      When it's said and done   And you're on the run   And the only law comes under the gun.I want my own thing   So bad I'm gonna scream      I can't choose, so confused   What's it all mean?.Love lifted me   Love lifted me   When nothing else could help   Love lifted me..Take me away to somewhere   Take me away from here!.Appendages flailing, you're running at me   Ferocious, tenaciously clawing at me   The devious gelatin holding me fast   Miraculous now you let me move past   Over the wall rushing rivers of sleaze   The tips of stalactites incising my knees   A slipper, a sand dollar day at the shore   Nice evening at home that I dread even more   Would you please   Make clear to me   I'm peering out through your opacity   Though you rehearse   Tomorrow's verse   Forgive me if I don't sing in your key   Look back on those days when my life was a haze   The gelatin lay on a truncated sleigh   Copernicus drank from a vessel that stank   The free masons crank to the overflow tank      Bane of the weasel, for biding his fun   Jump on the turnstile and watch me go 'round   Swim with the cactus and float with the stone   I try to convey what you strive to condone      Da da, da da, da-da, da da doo   Da da, da da, da-da, da da doo   Da da, da da, da-da, da da da-da da da da da do      Would you please   Make clear to me   I'm peering out through your opacity   Though you rehearse   Tomorrow's verse   Forgive me if I don't sing in your key      Would you please (In all that dust and stone)   Make clear to me (And when you see me)   Why nothing is the first thing that I see   ?.

One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote shows that even though they technically weren't family, they still loved eachother enough to be family. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 and it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that they love eachother more than anything. they are leaving behind and would do anything to give them better lives. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that for his parents loving him, he gives them love. That is the mood in the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives."

In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS1, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family... my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" The mood here is nuetral but kind of happy because the author is talking about her house. In paragraph @NUM2 it @CAPS1, ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This mood is @CAPS2 because the author is talking about the parents hardships. Also, in paragraph @NUM3, it @CAPS1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also shows that the mood is happy because the author is grateful. These are the various moods that the author had in the memoir."

Happy because he loved his family, his culture, and his home. ""In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.

Without knowing alot about this new country, they struggled to overcome problems. Narciso is grateful to his parents for living their life to start over. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""

The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned."
"Do it in the name of love..Progress, taste it, invest-it-all,   Champagne breakfast for everyone..Well I'm standin' on a [g] corner - with a bucket in my [d] hand   I'm waitin' for a [a7] woman - that ain't got no [d] man..Everyone's got their breaking point   With me it's spiders and with you it's me   Thugs in perpetuity   When we're excited little birds around the feeder   The cat's indifferent or he's just furious   It seems that he's never neither   I do the rolling you do the detail   I do the rolling you do the detail      Hair bird plucks a hair from a sleeping dog   To build her nest she said I've looked around   And I like your hair the best   I do the rolling you do the detail   I do the rolling you do the detail      Ruby, honey are you mad at your man?.I always knew you were a scientist at heart..Blue again   Blue again   And you know darn well   It's you again   You said last night   We were through again   And now, I'm blue again      I'm alone again   Alone again   I'm out around on my own again   There's a mockingbird that's flown again   And I'm alone again      Now baby, though I said I hate you   I love you more every day, babe   Though I aggravate you   All that I'm dying to say   Is that it's new again   You again   And we'll meet today at half past two again   And tonight, we'll fight   Again   And I'll be blue again.Do you think I'd ever let you   Get away with it, huh?.We, each of us are fine   For we have all heard the word   But grouped together   Babel's triumph stampedes   The thoughtless herd   Nothing changes..The mood in exerpt is in between grateful and caring and hard because thats what @PERSON1's mood ended they way it created was by the type of house he living with them and and also the people @PERSON1 about. Also another mood is comfortable for example when he said ""I was born in Newark, @LOCATION2, in a simple house explains his mood towards everything. "
"What'cha waiting for?.Talk to my troubled brain   If you can feel my pain   So much hurting that's living in my head   Now I can barely breathe   And now my heart's disease   And my name and my life has been stepped   On and on' No no!.Slide it in, right to the top,   I'm gonna slide it in, slide it in, slide it, in baby..Someone explain?.it was then she discovered   that her faith couldn't last      Christopher, Mr. Christopher   why won't they leave you alone?.Haugh!.You'll love me till I die,   Or at least until I try..A high for a high so to speak..The author created a calm mood. Everything he talks about is in the same tone. When he talks about the kitchen in his home, he also created a happy mood. He was calm while talking about the memories in his old home. He stayed calm when he talked about how caring his parents were. Overall, the whole writing is in a calm mood."
"They tried the hotels, the motels, the bed-and-breakfast   Locals, but no one seemed to have any room..Love is everywhere, I see it   You are all that you can be, go on and be it   Life is perfect, I believe it   Come and play the game with me      Open yourself to the first celebration   Open your eyes to the joy and pain   Life is the fruit of your own creation   Every new birth is a soul regained      Love is everywhere, I see it   You are all that you can be, go on and be it   Life is perfect, I believe it   Come and play the game with me      Drinking my life from a silver fountain   Sweet water running to the cold salt sea   Old man moon on a white-top mountain   Sound of the wind singing dreams for me      Love is everywhere, I see it   You are all that you can be, go on and be it   Life is perfect, I believe it   Come and play the game with me      Follow your heart like a flying stallion   Race with the sun to the edge of night   Form your truth like a gold medallion   Dance in the circle of the love and the light      Love is everywhere, I see it   You are all that you can be, go on and be it   Life is perfect, I believe it   Come and play the game with me.I will stop, I will stop at nothing..You made the sun,   You made the moon,   Gave seasons change,   Woah   You made the clouds,   You put the rainbow after rain   Woah   Created time,   Now this ones mine,   Gave pictures frames,   Woah   Created man gave him woman,   Why did you do that for me?.Being in the places where we used to be   Somehow being there without you's not the same..You'll get your mucky fingers burned..In my Promised Land   In the Middle East   What will we do about terrorism?.We'll be back, shortly, don't go nowhere.In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", tells us of how @CAPS1 grew up with his parents who which immigrated from Cuba, the mood created by the author is warm & comforting.For example, the mood is comforting because, @CAPS1 speaks of how, his parents created a traditional Cuban home, out of nothing but a one bedroom apartment. @CAPS1 descrbes his life being centered around the kitchen & his parent always provideing what they could the best for him.""@CAPS1 also states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrafice"". Ive often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could ever have done""."
"All men and women living on the Earth,   Ties of hope and love,   Sister and brotherhood..And now I'm back to let you know I can really shake 'em down..Say something to the team."".The doggies bawl - and bawl and bawl   Deep in the heart of texas..We're collecting dust,   But our love's enough..Black rain is right before me..I found out the hard way, some things you just cant get   When I fell in love with a woman I wish I never met   I was in the wrong place, at the wrong time   I fell easy prey to an innocent way, I was so blind      I call out her name, I turn around to find her   She's a spellbinder      I've never been a easy man, so hard to please   But she made me feel life was unreal, oh Lord, how she satisfied me   I tried to break away, but I didn't stand a chance   She planned it so well, I was under her spell, I was in a trance      I call out her name, I turn around to find her   She's a spellbinder      Now do you know what love can do?.Alleluia!.In the excerpt of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a memoir by @PERSON1 and internationally recognized clothing designer, there is a distinct mood of fond recollection of a warm and loving environment, as well as a greatfulness for the lessons learned in this environment. Narciso mentions how his parents created a home for him even though it meant making many, many sacrifices. He describes his @NUM1 â€“ room apartment as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing. Narciso explains how many people in his neighbor hood are immigrants that come together, help one another, and form one big family.  ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Many people in his neighborhood joined Narciso's family for meals and this brought many of them closer. At the end of the memoir, Narciso explains how greatful he is that his parents gave up their lives in Cuba to give him a better chance in @LOCATION1 despite their hardships. This undeniable thankfulness is a large part of this memoir. "

In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. He really wants people to be able to feel to happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him. He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent."

One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference."
"Whatever you've got..I was born in the Southland!.I've tried to give to you what you need to get you through..I know I never said it to you,   Why, I'd never know..!.She left me as the golden sun   behind the hill top it did hide,   And when I found that she had gone   I laid my guitar down and cried..Hey!.There somethings in this life that I fail to understand even as even as a grown man I don't comprehend   Like how in the fuck did I walk up the stairs and some fucking how I ended up down here   Well laughing and giggleing like a little school girl with my homies Jay and Tech ain't even there Hmmm   What the fuck not a damn single bitch in this place but some ones figgin my nuts   I got it done well sittin with my pants around my ankles dry humpin my hand   A lot of mother fucker claim the insanity plead but not me   Its this house that's gone mad I'm insane as can be!.The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave. An example from the text says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved ."" @CAPS1 example from the text says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In conclusion because of his parents love for him they sacrificed alot, so he could have a happy and good life. "

Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man."
"Bible-belt 'round anglo-waste, putting sinners in their place   Yeah, right, great if you're so good explain the shit stains on your face.How I wish I could get back   To the land of the wetback,   And forget the alamo,   In old mexico..The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square..Now, then--   Ringo: All right, John..Please come back home to me,   Now you won't have to say   That you'll stay with me, baby,   No, it's not that way..When you're alone and the day is done   Don't you wish we'd give it one more try   Ah, just one more try?.(Fat girls)   Ooo, can be so much fun   Their mouths are motors   (What a girl)   So let their motors run!.Is that what our dreams have become?.The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort."

That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood.Narciso is very greatful. He said he has ""learned the definition of 'family' "". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot and he recognize that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard."

The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him."

author created in the memoir was grateful and happy for what he had. The author values relationships and he is grateful to have his "" family"". He says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1""  In other words he is saying that he is lucky to have what he has, a ""family"". Being lucky for what you have also is a synonym for grateful, meaning that the mood of this memoir was grateful. He also said that his family kept an open door and open arms, showing that they would give some of what they had to other people, showing that they knew that others had less, and that they were grateful for what they had. Mood, means tone or a feeling, so the mood of this was grateful and happy."
"Very happy!.A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H   I got a gal in Kalamazoo   Don't want to boast, but I know   She's the toast of Kalamazoo   (Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo)      Years have gone by   My, my, how she grew   I liked her looks   When I carried her books in Kalamazoo   (Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo)      I'm gonna send a wire   Hoppin' on a flyer, leavin' today   Am I dreamin'?.When I see her coming down the street,   I be the fever giver, high to the beat..Look out the left the captain said   The lights down there, that's where we'll land   I saw a falling star burn up   Above the Las Vegas sands   It wasn't the one that you gave to me   That night down south between the trailers   Not the early one   That you can wish upon,   Not the northern one   That guides in the sailors      Oh star bright, star bright   You've got the lovin' that I like, all right   Turn this crazy bird around   I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight      You got the touch so gentle and sweet   But you've got that look so critical   Now I can't talk to you baby   I get so weak   Sometimes I think love is just mythical   Up there's a heaven   Down there's a town   Blackness everywhere and little lights shine   Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down   Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine      Oh star bright, star bright   You've got the lovin' that I like, all right   Turn this crazy bird around   I shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight      I'm drinking sweet champagne   Got the headphones up high   Can't numb you out   Can't drum you out of my mind   They're playing ""Goodbye baby, Baby Goodbye,   Ooh, ooh, love is blind""   Up go the flaps, down go the wheels   I hope you got your heat turned on baby   I hope they finally fixed your automobile   I hope it's better when we meet again baby      Star bright, star bright   You got the lovin' that I like, all right   Turn this crazy bird around   I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight.And I'll be hopin' that it'll be real, real soon..Like so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing   But a broken heart, took her soul away      Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing   She could see the world, and it's foolish ways      How, we, spend our days, casting, love aside   Loosing, site of life, day, by, day      She saw poverty, breaking all the home   Wounded warriors, took her song away      But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing   When this broken world, mends its foolish ways      Now we, spend our days, catching, up on life   All be-cause of you, Jenny Wren      You saw, who we are, Jenny Wren.Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd..Got my freedom riding along the freeway..The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. Here are some points to consider. First of the mood of the author is I think greatfulness. For example ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation. For example ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love. I kno this because he talks about love and his family and friends alot. For example ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. In conclusion the authors moods can be described in many different ways."

It starts by talking of things Narciso learned in the home. The Cuban music ""which I [Narciso] a door to this day."" As well as the culinary skills, ""I am eternally grateful."" Narciso is happy, therefore the mood is happy.Also, Narciso talks about the grat community. ""It was a close -knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand..."" Narciso goes into great detail describing the good things, like the community. The author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents. ""They came selflessly... to give thir children a better life."" Narciso Rodriguez describes many positive effects of her parents as immigrants. As a result of the positivity, a happy mood is created."

Narcisco talked about how when he moved to @LOCATION1 he moved into a three-bedroom apartment. He brought with him the love of cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today. Narciso was very grateful that his parents came to @LOCATION1 to help him make his home seem more like a traditional Cuban home. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.

It because the mother showed he how to love people. Quote she said... Always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love. It was there I learned the real difinition of ""family.""

I like when her mom let anybody to there household to the table.In the mood that created by the author is happyness in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."

Narciso Rodriguez create a feeling of mood about their home life. Narciso talk about life at home and about his parents cooking. He is greatful for his parents cooking and how he learned from them. In paragraph three it states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives. He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. He is always grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. The whole memoir is about love, family which sets a positive mood for the reader."

This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.                                                                                                                                                    The author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""                                  The mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there, and go there."

One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir."

In paragraph @NUM1 it also says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my graditude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

He explained his life, home, family, and parents. He said that, ""family"", was a great thing in that he learned the real definition.

He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen. He loves cooking and his parents taught him how to cook.

Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life."

His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). ""(and for wich I am eternally greatful)."" His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing. ""I will allways be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And he is not affraid to let them know, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repetedly."" @CAPS1 the memoir, the auther creates a mood that he is greatful to all his parents love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped."

The author creates a feel of happiness and gratefulness throughout the story. @CAPS1 uses words like ""passionate"", ""rich"", and ""thanked"" to describe his family and house. @CAPS1 also creates a sense of pride in his parents and family. @CAPS1 discusses how his family was always growing. His parents doors were always open to everyone. @CAPS1 is thankful for that and feels that @CAPS1 is lucky to have such a close knit community of friends and family. The author also mentions what his parents risked and sacraficed by going to the States. @CAPS1 is both proud and thankful of his parents. @CAPS1 says his parents, ""Had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1 is so proud that his parents were so selfless and put everything on the line so that their future would be better. @CAPS1 is thankful and grateful for everything his parents and family have done.As the author mentions all of this, the readers themselves @MONTH1 remember a bit of their childhood. Some @MONTH1 relate to the story completely while others laugh at certain parts that they too remember about their parents. In the end, the author's right, its the parents that turn this simple house into a loving home."
"I know what you're thinking,   I know what you're feeling,   I know everything in this world surrounds me,   I feel you're breathing,   I feel you're screaming,   I feel I can't go no where in this

underneath the mistletoe, show me baby that you love me so oh oh   Oh oh oh.The author creates a loving, and caring mood. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozzy bead. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of oppertunities. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1."
"Its time to shed your skin..Oh, what do I care if icicles form?.I want to know what became of the changes   We waited for love to bring   Were they only the fitful dreams   Of some greater awakening?.But now I've found a teacher, and the teacher has a master,   The master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster..What if our love had never went away?.I don't feel a thing for you!.I wanted to show you, all the fellings that are real..The time I've spent, working myself to death   Thought that's what you wanted   I thought you needed my help   To make it good again, to make us strong   To make you happy, to push you along   And gain some respect, to be thrown a crumb   I was on my knees, when you knocked me down      The wheels fell off, the bottom dropped out   The checks all bounced, I came in your mouth   Your mother came calling but there was no one around   The trash caught fire when the leaves turned brown   The vultures were circling when the circus left town   I left you a note but I wrote it in disappearing ink      If you could save yourself, you'd save us all   Is that what you called me for,   Is that why you're knocking on my door?.I think the overall mood created by the author, is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family."

He appreciated the house and was grateful for his parents. He is grateful for his parents and for their love and sacrifice. He is grateful they love and care for him. He says, ""I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a home.

"Idaho, Jellicoe, Argentina, Diamontina   Pasadena, Catalina, see what I mean-a..Can you feel my skin   Can you feel my bones   Can you put my spine in plaster and take me home      So unpleasant inside and out   So unpleasant inside and out   If you like I'll tell you about it   You wouldn't want to know      My heads full of water   Tears I never cried   Could you hold me under the shower   In the cold outside      So unsteady inside and out   So unsteady inside and out   If you like I'll tell you about it   You wouldn't want to be      Separated out   Separated out   Separated out      I need medical attention   Where's my memory gone   Everything I told you - including this,   I already forgot      Separated out   From the living stream   The thing that couldn't lie straight   Straight in the machine      So unstable inside and out   Don't know how much longer I'll take it   If you like I'll sell you a ticket   Or you can get in for free      Am I enough of a freak   To be worth paying to see   Am I enough of a freak   To be worth paying to see      Can you feel my skin   Can you feel my bones   Can you put my spine in plaster and take me home   Can you kiss my face   Let me know it's there   Can you give it shape   Can you kinda care      Am I enough of a freak   To be worth paying to see   Enough of a freak   To be worth paying to see      Enough   Enough      They're pointing and laughing   They're pointing and laughing at me.At night, I pray before I sleep in hope of find the stars   And you're the only one that could take me this far   I'll be forever searching for your love      I walked away but I was wrong   You're the one that makes me strong   You're the fire that keeps me warm   How will I get through this storm?.It's all just inadvertent imitation and I don't mean mine   It's all across this nation....No no no   You got the best of me   Oh can't you see?.Yeah!.To see will your mother and your father   Let us have a rendezvous      'Cause I want you to be my, be my little loved one   I will be true to you, to you my love, in every way   And in our little rendezvous we'll have   A beautiful wedding day      Then I'll build a spaceship with a heavy payload   We'll go 'bip-bip-bip' way out in the wide open blue   Where we can love one another   In our little rendezvous      We'll take a basket, a short wave radio   A-tunin' on the record shows all over the whole wide world   And in our little rendezvous there'll be   A happy boy and girl      We'll kiss the moon, my love, go around the world   We'll send a signal back to mom and dad from me and you   Tell them they'll soon have a grandson   In our little rendezvous      Bip-bip-bip, bip-bip-bip   Bip-bip, bip-bip....What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?.In this @DATE1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"",Narciso Rodriguez creates a safe, calm and secure mood. His description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 says  ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS1 just a backdrop. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close â€“ knit community... ""and "" countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way, Narciso described his family and neighborhood, keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1. "

Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremily grateful."" @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says ""I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him.""I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly"". That also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful. It also shows how the author is happy about his parents desisions."

The mood created by the author in the memoir would be loving/warmth. The fact that Narciso's parents would take people in, until they can get back on their feet. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life. The sacrificed everything everything leaving their families, friends, and career. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done."" The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso. Basically, his first everything was done there. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" The mood created by the author made me feel grateful for what I have in life."

Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way."
"And so this is Christmas,   For weak and for strong,   For rich and the poor ones,   The world is so wrong..Keep your aim locked,   The night grows dark,   Keep your eyes open..Broken song, empty words I know,   Still live in my heart all alone..And if forever never comes tonight   And if forever never comes tonight   And if forever never comes tonight   I'll hold on, hold on      I keep listening to my chest for a beat, but there's nothing left   It's been a week since I've seen you, and I still can't believe it   'Cause I'm dying inside alone      And in every dream we gotta be apart   I'm like a baby with a broken heart   But the second that I see you   You will know how much I need you   Because I'll never be letting you go      (Now you know why)   I'm lost without you   And there's nothing I can do   Your the one that I can't go without   And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever      I've got you now and I'm not letting go of you   Never been together long enough   Because every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven      And if forever never comes tonight   And if forever never comes tonight   And if forever never comes tonight   I'll hold on, hold on      In a symphony, baby you would be my melody   And you would flow like a river, slowing going on forever   Like a feather that's blowing away   Like everyone that needs a fairytale, like every mother's love that never fails   Like every game that needs a player, and a sinner needs a savior   I'm the villain that your willing to save      (Now you know why)   I'm lost without you   And there's nothing I can do   Your the one that I can't go without   And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever      I've for you now and I'm not letting go of you   Never been together long enough   Because every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven      I'm willing to wait, just to see you another day   What I'm waiting for will wash this pain away   And it's never too late      And if forever never comes tonight   And if forever never comes tonight   And if forever never comes tonight   I'll hold on, hold on      (Now you know why)   I'm lost without you   And there's nothing I can do   Your the one that I can't go without   And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever      I've got you now and I'm not letting go of you   Never been together long enough   'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven   'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven.""well, it was eaten by snakes...""

He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."
"Dark weekends in the sun out on Chelsea Road   Descending the stairs, Frankie, my one   Check your makeup in the mirror c'mon babe let's go   We'll dance 'round this dirty town 'til the night is all done   Let all the finer things sleep alone tonight   Let all the minor kings lose their thrones tonight   Don't worry about us, baby, we'll be alright      Well everybody's dying, this town's closing down   They're all sittin' down at the courthouse waiting for 'em to take the flag down   I see strange flashes in the sky up above   Gonna spend the night at the drive-in with the one that I love   At dusk the stars all appear on the screen   Yeah, just like they do each night in my dreams   But tonight's no dream, Frankie, I can feel myself too   Well now and forever my love is for you      Walk softly tonight little stranger   Yeah into these shadows we're passing through   Talk softly tonight, little angel   You make all my dream worlds come true      Well lately I've been standing out in the freezing rain   Readin' them want ads out on Chelsea Road   I'm winging down the street in search of new games   Hustling through these nightlights' diamond glow   Well Frankie I don't know what I'm gonna find   Maybe nothing at all, maybe a world I can call mine   Shining like these streetlights down here on the strand   Bright as the rain in the palm of your hand      Walk softly tonight, little stranger   Into the shadows where lovers go   Talk softly to me, little angel   Whisper your secrets so soft and low.Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought..I don't care what you say, you're still a tramp..Acting on the moment, it's spontaneous..Now it's closing time, the music's fading out   Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout..Somewhere in the west   Gold teeth, but sometime is gleaming   We know we are the best   Even know, the beasts lie screaming   We've got power to spare   A new clear day   Is dawning they say   But tell us, don't you dare   The piper has a price that we pay   Dear preacher,   Do you think that we'll see the light?.I wanna be found ready..So we move out to the garden and look at everything we've grown..In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story."
"There it was   Just like old faithful   The eternal fountain of filthi   I took a walk straight out of town   But then I stopped and took my time for pleasure   I was alone, I looked around   I heard a voice 50 I buckled for safety   And there it was down on the ground   A pool of sound that showed my own reflection   In a fountain of filth   Eternal fountain of filth   I tried to run I couldn't move   Frozen solid while the thoughts of men   Attacked me   Out of my head the fountain shot   And drowned me in a serum that I couldn't   Put a stop to   It was me myself and I locked in a struggle   With the talking head below me   In a fountain of filth   Eternal fountain of filth   I got a hunger that makes me say things   I got a hunger that makes me do things   I got a hunger that makes me want things   I'm just a victim of filth   Nowhere are we safe   From the power of   From the reach of   From the appeal of   The eternal fountain of filth.Is this really you?.his mind is somewhere else..[Chorus]   Wake me up before you go, ooh I need a little more   Just a little more, a little more of your love   Wake me up before you go, ooh I need a little more   Just a little more, a little more of your love   Cause your love, your love, your love   Wake me up with some more of your love   Cause your love, your love, your love   Wake me up with some more of your love      [Verse 2]   Oh I need a back talk, girl I'm your dady, no sass talk   Oh baby girl you inspire me, give me the reason to keep on   My baby, my Royalty, girl you're the lyrics to my song   Girl you got this heart lock on me, I don't think I can control it   I hold on with all my might while you look at me in my eye   Like a vitamin you put back my energy, you're making me stronger, and bring out the best of me      [Pre-Chorus]   So before I go to work, can I ask you a favour?.Does she make you happy?.And Aubrey was her name,   A not so very ordinary girl or name..Save my soul   I don't want to be no chains that hold   Gotta be a wild new world out..Screams break the silence   Waking from the dead of night   Vengeance is boiling   He's returned to kill the light   Then when he's found who he's looking for   Listen in awe and you'll hear him      Bark at the moon      Years spent in torment   Buried in a nameless grave   Now he has risen   Miracles would have to save   Those that the beast is looking for   Listen in awe and you'll hear him      Bark at the moon      They cursed and buried him   Along with shame   And thought his timeless soul had gone   In empty burning Hell-unholy one   But now he's returned to prove them wrong      Howling in shadows   Living in a lunar spell   He finds his heaven   Spewing from the mouth of hell      And when he finds who he's looking for   Listen in awe and you'll hear him   Bark at the moon.In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back."
"I'm madly in anger with you!.We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes..Now they've darkened all the windows   And the seats are naugahide   I've been waiting for an hour   I can't find a place to hide   The being known as wondergirl   Is speaking, I believe   It's not easy trying to tell her   That I shortly have to leave      Why don't you be like me?.Are there years between us?.Oh, I gotta go now..Hold me, touch me, make me your woman   I will love you with sweet surrender   Tonight our hearts will beat as one   So won't you hold me, make me your woman      Tonight, something in your eyes I see   A pure and simple honesty   Won't you hold me in your arms   Tonight will last forever   Let's not waste this precious time   This moment's our's to treasure      Won't you hold me in your arms   Don't make me wait forever   When the morning sun appears   We'll find our way together      Believe you when you say that you love me   Know that I won't take you for granted   Tonight our hearts will beat as one   Hold me, make me your woman      Tonight, something in your eyes I see   I won't betray your trust in me   Won't you hold me in your arms   Tonight will last forever   Let's not waste this precious time   This moment's ours to treasure      Won't you hold me in your arms   Don't make me wait forever   When the morning sun appears   We'll find our way together      Hold me, touch me   Make me your woman tonight.I remember you said,   Long as rivers flow..I'd set the tracking system   With your safety fuse,   And set the countdown   For 2000 blues..The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful."
"Great, great monkey man..This is your town, this is my place   This is where my whole world is lived in   Nothing much, and just out of reach of all the city lights   It's a high town, it's a low town   It's get here, come on you grow town   No-one does, but everyone thinks they're gonna make it soon   This is one place I respected   Now I feel it's really dejected   No-one cares and the people just stare   And a man on the box says   ""Hey you, don't walk away, vote for me   You'll get more pay, keep working hard""   But they work slow      Here it comes now, Sunday morning   Just another sleepy town yawning   Down below everything looks just like another day   But, in the warm glow of the sunrise   There's a child who's searching with young eyes   Looking 'round and feeling inside he's gonna fly away   There was one time I was leaving   But the folks around me kept grieving   Friends said go, but my dad said no   And my mum kept saying   ""Don't go, don't go away   Don't leave us, you've got to stay   Just raise them kids, oh mother no""      No prospects, just projects   Don't try to tell me we're living   There's no real need to try   Can't you see this town gonna die      Hail the new age, it's a rat cage   Join the place for breeding dumb spieces   All stacked up and doing whatever someone tells you to   Burn the place down, make it dead ground   Show the people just what they're missing   Wake up, wake up, can't you believe in what I'm telling you   There's a house where I was born in   Now it's changed without any warning   Cranes just crash and bricks just smash   While a billboard's saying   ""Let's go, let's get away   Come fly me, you've weeks to pay   When sunshine calls, but I won't go      This is our town.Where them girls at..That's no lie..Now Satan was an angel in Heaven   But he stirred up trouble and woe   So the Lord commanded that the Devil be branded   So you know darn well   He went to Hell   Yeah, he went to Hell   Yeah, he went to Hell   He went to Hell..He'll fly his astral plane,   Takes you trips around the bay,   Brings you back the same day,   Timothy Leary..You give my your love, the one thing I can't lose..How change can make you feel so free..The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."

The child in this story talks abou how greatful they are for there parints. Their happy because their all a family living together as one. Evry one is exsepting of one and another. Over all I think the mood is happy."

Narciso is grateful for his cuban culture and how it was incorperated into his life growing up even though he was in New Jersey. He is also grateful for his parents and the sacrafices they made for him in order to grow up in @LOCATION2. His parents also taught him to be kind to everyone, and treat everyone like family. He is grateful for that."

One of the moods that was created in the memoir was happiness. Back in his past, his parents shared all of their Cuban family recipes, they had a lot of family and friend celebrations with the rest of the neighbor hood, sharing friendship and helping others in need @CAPS1 as long as you can sea, the family and the neighbors all came together as one big family to be happy, to make a happy community, and that made the memoir happy. Another mood that was created by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything. He talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to get further away, and the mood changes to sadness. The memories are growing old, but he will always remember his ""family""and his name. The author did a great job at creating those two moods and putting them into his memoir."

In @CAPS2 @NUM2, the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice."" In @CAPS2 @NUM3, the author says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM1, the author talks about how his parents @CAPS3 nothing about the country when they came and how the struggled financially when they came.

"I have faced it, a life wasted   I'm never going back again      Oh I escaped it, a life wasted   I'm never going back again      Having tasted, a life wasted   I'm never going back again      Oh I erased it, a life wasted   I'm never going back again.Just open your mind and you will find   The way it's always been..He's watching the girls on the dance floor   He's watching the light in her hair   He's praying that love's gonna come soon   There's a sweet smell of hope in the air      Just another boy from a steel town   With the flash of the mill in his eye   He don't move for hip cool or fashion   But he knows where the deepest one lies      And he'd love to be warm   And he'd love to love you   So give him some good news      All the cards on the table   But don't look that man in the eye   Say a prayer for the dealer   And kiss your old life goodbye      Go to church light a candle   But don't lose your head for God's sake   Why is my heart beating faster   Oh why do my hands start to shake      'Cause he'd love to be warm   And he'd love to love you   So give him some good news.But how would it feel to hold me in your arms   You could get to know me down on the farm   Then you could see me as the child I've become   'Cause being grown up can be so lonesome   Baby, how would it feel to hold me now   Baby, how would it feel to hold me now      Interview, who's interviewing who   Are you interviewing me   Or am i interviewing you.Give me an inch and I'll make the best of it..Love is pain I hear you say   Love has a cruel and bitter way of   Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain   How could it be that what you need the most   Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?.I will dare, Keep in mind,   I'll be there for you..(Conway)   Goodbye Loretta....The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happieness and appreciation. Narciso understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice""."

That it is calm, and in its own way the mood Kind of leads to forgiveness and @CAPS2. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go you never forget about your family. And that the memories are much better then the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you deciede to go, to a different Country. Never forget who gave you birth. And who loves you. Which really means family. And friends. But the @CAPS3 That they describe in the @CAPS4. He decieds to leave his family to go to america and to get an education. And do something big with his life. And he is going through other things to like, the other People are thinking of him as a immagrant. And how the rest of the family @CAPS5 leave there @CAPS6. But the family to them that really didnt mean anything to them. In there house they left there door open to any family that needs help, or that there going through the same thing as what their family is going through. So thats the mood that the author is trying to describe to you."

The mood is created by his parents and where he lives. One way the mood is nonstalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents, he is helping the nonstalgic mood grow. Also, where he live helps the mood. ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home those"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2).

The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it. The author really shows the reader that he is appreicative of his family."

The mood created by the author in the memior of Narciso Rodriguez is gratefull. The author's memior is grateful especially according to paragraphs five, six, and seven. Paragraph five talks about how grateful he is for his mother and father to come to the United States with such courage, without having any knowledge of the language or of the culture. ""The faith that this struggle would them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" is what starts off paragraph six. The author explains how he has been telling his parents of how much more courageous their plan was then his would have ever been. The author also says how he admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly. His parent taught him two lessons with out telling him, but with their lives, ""and these teachings have been the basis of my life"", the author states. Finally in the last paragraph the very last sentence says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" which ultimately shows how grateful Narciso Rodriguez truly is."

A memoir is of writing someone's own feelings and experiences during their life. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez tells of her life in her simple home in Newark, New Jersey. Throughout the memoir Rodriguez sits a distinct mood of love and care, which she learned from her parents back in her childhood. The mood is mainly set by the memories of her environment, friends, and culture. All of these things are described by Rodriguez to make you feel the mood she expresses. The mood of love and care is incorporated into the memories of her childhood, beginning from the time she was born. Rodriguez begins to draw the mood in paragraph two by describing her home that was made into a traditional Cuban home by her parents. She describes the ""rich culinary skills...

When he is recalling all the memories he had it proves to be a warm and happy mood. The cookings skills that his parents passed on to him he says that he's grateful for and passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day. The author also states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age. To wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home."

It took buckets full of curage and modevation to get through this huge transitien. Narciso Rodriguez's famly whent through this move using family power and the love they had for each other. It was a big change for them to be in a one room apartment to a @NUM1 room apartment. Through the memoir there was a mood of satisfaction and love for Cuba. For example, the memoir stated many times how much Narciso enjoyed the Cuban food and music and treditiens. Also the satisfaction mood comes out when Narciso talkes about how fortunate he is that his parents were willing to take the risk of moving to @CAPS2 to give him a better life. This showes that the love of a parent is stronger than enything in the world. Another mood is relieve. for example Narciso is relieved that his family made it to @CAPS2 sofly and sand.

""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""That was the mood created by the author in the @CAPS1."

Ive often told them that what they Did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Ive often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how importand family and friends are."

This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone says how much love there was in the house. The mood of this story was very comfortable and very, very loving."
"Let me believe   You won't turn away   After I've opened the door   But darlin', don't make me surrender too soon   I'm so afraid of the fall   Please give it time to be tender   And pretend it won't hurt at all   Please give it time to be tender   And pretend it won't hurt at all.You're the proud one..Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun   When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?.Here we are in this big old empty room, staring each other down   You want me just as much as I want you, let's stop fooling around   Take me baby, kiss me all over, play with my love   Bring out what's been in me for far too long   Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of   Do me baby, like you never done before   Give it to me till I just can't take no more   Do me baby, like you never done before   I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait      Here we are looking for a reason for you to lay me down   For a love like ours is never out of season, so baby please stop teasing me   What ya do, I can never love no other, you're the best I ever had   Whenever we're not close to one another, I just want you so bad      So do me baby, like you never done before   Give it to me till I just can't take no more   C'mon, do me baby, like you never done before   I want you now, I just can't wait no more      I said...

His parents passed on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking, ""and for which I am eternally grateful."" His parents would play, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day.)""In paragraph three, the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In his neighborhood, everyone came together and extended a hand to people who were clearly in need.Rodriguez went on to explain how his parents would have everyone over for dinner and help people get back on their feet. Towards the end of the story in paragraph six he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso Rodriguez says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."""
"[Chorus]   And I remember ""Baby, come home"",   And I remember ""Baby, come home"",   And I remember ""Baby, come home"",   And I remember ""Baby, come home"",   Did you ever love her?.You   You turned and walk away   I didn't know what to say   I closed my eyes to hide   The pain I felt inside   I could never understand   How love went out of hand   And now there's nothing I can do   Though the feeling hasn't passed   Sad to say our love didn't last   Please don't ask me to pretend   'Cause I know it's over   When I'm done forgetting you   You can say what you wanted to   Please don't ask me to pretend   'Cause I know it's over now   Now I'm left here all alone   A heart without a home   How will I ever find   The love I left behind   Once, the days were ours to share   Now you don't even care   And there's still nothing I can do   Though the feeling hasn't passed   Sad to say our love didn't last   Please don't ask me to pretend   'Cause I know it's over   When I'm done forgetting you   You can say what you wanted to   Please don't ask me to pretend   'Cause I know it's over now....I'll always be beside you..Faster, faster, to welcome disaster..You want to see the real wicked shit, where the wicked at?.Dress in Armour   Bring your sword and shield   And your lucky charm..Well come on over baby, jump into my time machine.I, I, I need something to live for   I'm on my knees and I'm begging      Something's fallen from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me   I don't believe it   Fallen from heaven, looks like a nightmare coming to save me   I don't believe it      I thought I saw the sky bleeding, thought I saw the sky bleeding   And I thought I saw you   I thought I saw oceans burning, thought I saw oceans burning   And I thought I saw you      I thought I saw angels falling   Beautiful, but still falling down   I bleed for you   I bleed for   I bleed for      I, I, I gave you something to die for   And this is how you betray me?.The mood created by the author in the memoir is love.                                                                                                         To start off, Narciso had so much love and appreciation for his parents decision to immigrate to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" The purpose of the author writing this was to strongly show how truly greatful Narciso is for the hardships his parents had to endure to give him a better life. And also to show the love that Narciso will always have for his parents.                                                                                                                                 Next, the author also expresses how important family and friends are to Narciso. In paragraph two Narciso explains her true love for him family and friends, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows how immensely immportant his family and friends involvement in her life is to him. In conclusion, the author purposfully showed how important his parents, family, and friends are to him to grasp the meaning of love he feels for his family."
"One to kill one keeps alive,   Get on your knees and suck it!.(It's all about the Pentiums, baby)   It's all about the Pentiums!.The waiting game is over, no need for pretending   We were meant to be   It's only getting stronger, the love I feel for you   It's no mystery      I've got to find some way to tell you, though our world seems far apart   It just don't have to be   The time has come to testify, all the feelings I've been holding back   It's time to set them free      [Chorus:]   I've been watching you from the other side   I've been wanting to hold you through the night   I've got to find my way to the other side   I want to hold you tonight and forever      The moment that I saw you   I knew inside my heart, all my dreams would come true   I know it took some time to realize   A love we can't deny, I've got to see it through      [Chorus]      I want to be the one who loves you, now and forever   I want to take my place beside you   I want to be the one to hold you, now and forever   I will meet you there on the other side      [Chorus] [x 2]      From the other side, from the other side   I want to hold you tonight and forever.Red lights holler   Deep Depression   What do we care?.Sometimes I feel like this world   Is just one big gigantic merry-go-round   You gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the air   Yeah, life is a three-ring circus   With clowns and freaks and camels and such   And you never know when you might be attacked by the bears      [Chorus]   Give me love, give me love, love me good   Sometimes I feel like   I'm afraid of my own shadow and then   Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan   But I could never live in a yurt   On a diet of Mongolian barbecue   I conquer the world for a moment, then the moment is gone      Chorus      Bridge:      Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray   If only to give thanks for making it through another day      Sometimes I wish I was in a movie   Or some 70's TV thing   Where everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the show   Yeah, but this ain't Hollywood   And this sure ain't the Brady Bunch   And how this plot's gonna all pan out, I don't really know      Chorus.Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...      O sing....Take the flag we wave, the freedoms that we sing..What that nigga want God?.The mood created by the author is very happy and grateful throughout the memoir. It is very interesting also, when he's talking about when his parents first bought the house and how happy they were in 1961 when they made their home into a traditional Cuban home, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) In that @CAPS1 he also says how he got his culinary skills from his parents and that he was grateful for it. He also says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) @CAPS3 you can tell a lot about his parents by those two sentences. @NUM3. They care about their children @NUM1.) They're not selfish @NUM5.) They're not afraid to make sacrifices and @NUM6.) They can adjust to new things and new surroundings. @CAPS3 by everything I have said the mood throughout the memoir was happy, kind, caring and many moods similar to those. The same moods came everyone that was mentioned in the memoir."
"Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,   Can't you believe your eyes?.I want to go home with Armadilla....But he'd rather have new shoes for them horses..""All right, okay,"" he said to me   ""I got nothing else to do."".[Verse:]   I'm a spit on it then I'm gonna sit on it You can fuck my girls to Daddy I'm a kindone it,   I'm a put my lips on ya lips, who's better, nigga you can ask Micheal Jack..I'm out with you, you got me head over heels   Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel      [Chorus:]   S.O.S..Rob Schneider: I'm Jewish!?!?!.Can I get a hell yeah?.The author of Narciso Rodriguez creates an enjoyably, happy, fun mood.  The author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there & or were there at some point. The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like I honestly was the experiencing his home & the love & kindness of his home. The love & friendship @CAPS1 shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. @CAPS1 shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph. Yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence. ""I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also especialy shows how hard his parents worked to stay up but still did so much to care for everyone else, all right in paragraph @NUM1."

Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter.

He does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish. The biggest part of the mood is talking about where he lived at first, where and what he had. He might have a good start with mood if he told more about the kind of education he got whether he was in Cuba or @LOCATION1. The mood was an overall ok because more about his life but the memoir was not a complete success. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, organized life it was a good tone of mood."

For example, he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" This peice also talks of his friendly home environment where everyone was welcome. He said ""My parents always kept up their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" @CAPS1 the mood this article conveyed a feeling of love, warmth, gratitude, happiness and acceptance"

For example, ""...passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). Rodriguez's parents loved to cook, something he remembers fondly, and he shares their love to this day. The reader feels this love when reading the line. The reader feels how much @PERSON1 loves Cuban music when reading the next sentence. He even states how much he adores Cuban music even now. Another example, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). @PERSON1 even says ""warm home,"" and warmth is definitly felt while reading this line. The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can imagine this. Another example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents provided a warm envirorment opened to loved ones because they are very warm and loving people themselves. @PERSON1 and the reader feel the emotion because of @ORGANIZATION2's writing. one final example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6). The reader gets a feel of how much Rodriguez loves his parents. @PERSON1 even says  ""love."" His parents are loving people and so is @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 had a warm and loving childhood, which he depicts greatly in his memoir."

The mood is happiness because, the author is talking about how Narciso childhood use to be when he was little. The enviroment of his home, and his cuban culture. He mentions how his family came over from dinner sometimes, and the cuban heritage filled the air. Also how the cuban music brought enjoyment. And that just brought him happiness."
"It's hard to find a reason left to stay,   But it's our town, We love it anyway..I can love   I can speak   Without somebody else operating me   You gave me eyes and now I see   I'm not your robot   I'm just me      I'm not your robot   I'm just me   I'm not your robot      I would scream   But I'm just this hollow shell   Waiting here   Begging please   Set me free so I can feel      Hey!.so it won't blow up in my eye   And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme      Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams   Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi   For if I hold my hand outstretched   A little bird comes to me      I might recite a small prayer   If I ever said them   I lay down on an iron frame   Found myself in bedlam      Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars   Wailing echoes down the corridors   The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""   Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem""      And in this pit of sadness   Where the rank of wretched plunge   We've buried all the innocents   Now we must bury revenge      They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a mustang   And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle   They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine   And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine      Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces   Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces   Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance   Though I seemed a long way from my home      It really was no distance   And I might recite a small prayer   If I ever said them   I lay down on an iron frame      Found myself in bedlam   Bowing like an actor acknowledging applause   Playing the Crusader who was conquering the Moors   And he knew the consequences, but he won't accept the cause   Wailing echoes down the corridors.Get ready for me, love,   Cause I'm a ""comer,""   I simply gotta march,   My heart's a drummer..break this bread and drink the wine   just remember with whom you dine   will you remember me when I'm not among you now   Peter you still deny me, Judas you will betray   last supper, it's your last supper   it is finished..I bet you're wonderin' how I knew   'Bout your plans to make me blue   With some other guy you knew before   Between the two of us guys   You know I loved you more   It took me by surprise I must say   When I found out yesterday   Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine   Not much longer would you be mine   Oh I heard it through the grapevine   Oh I'm just about to lose my mind      Honey, honey yeah..Everywhere I go,   Everyone I know   Whispers that you're growing tired of me,   Say it isn't so..Health-food fagot with a bartered bride   Likes to comb his hair with a dipper ride   Once had a friend with a cloven foot   Once he called the tune in a checkered quit      Great Deceiver      In the door on the floor in a paper bag   There's a shoe-shine boy with a gin-shop slag   She raised him up and she called him son   And she canonized the ground that he walked upon      Great Deceiver      Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary   Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary      Cigarettes, ice cream, Cadillacs blue jeans      In the night he's a star in the Milky Way   He's a man of the world by the light of day   A golden smile and a proposition   And the breath of God smells of sweet sedition      Great Deceiver      Sing hymns make love get high fall dead   He'll bring his perfume to your bed   He'll charm your life 'til the cold winds blow   Then he'll sell your dreams to a picture show      Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary   Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary      Cadillacs, blue jeans, dixieland playing on the ferry   Cadillacs, blues jeans, drop a glass full of antique sherry.Narciso Rodriguez expresses many moods of happiness in the memoir. @CAPS1 is thankful, ""But, in reallty, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" That statement shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life full of great friends and families. The mood of the memoir is very up-beat because Narciso is talking about how great his life has been since @CAPS1 was born. ""I've often told them of my admiration for there strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" That quote shows how proud @CAPS1 is of his parents because they gave up their families, friends, and careers so that @CAPS1 could have a better life in @LOCATION1. Narciso says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1's saying that @CAPS1's very happy that his parents did that for him. Many quotes from the memoir support and set the mood to describe Narciso's life."

The author explains how his parents brought him to the United States. All of his neighbors were spanish, cuban or Italian. They were all friends and had a good bond. He had people at his house for dinners. It was here in the United States, that he really understood what family was or what a home was. He couldn't show his parents how grateful he was for them to go through such a hard time to make their childrens lives better. The thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful."
"Sometimes when the evening's young   The wind dies down, the setting sun   Crochets the clouds with yarn so fine   And fills the oceans with red wine      The trees, the sky, the forest fair   Bring a flavor to the air   I raise my glass and in a while   You answer with a secret smile      Hold on, hold on to me      An airborne leaf that landed near   Has carried Dionysus here   He'll slip away but only when   He sees our glasses filled again.My jacket's gonna be cut slim and checked   Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck   I ride a G.S..I will not grow in the light   Until I pass through the darkest caverns   Of my heart..You cannot blame us for crying to you..Huh, huh..Pizza, pizza pie   Every minute, every second   Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy   What a splendid pie?.Alberta, Alberta,   Where'd you stay last night?.You know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long..In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the ton is happy and loving. In this memoir there are many examples about how the tone is loving, and happy, but heres a few. First in paragraph @NUM1 there + two phrases in parenthesees that show how @CAPS1 loved the things like the music and the cooking of his home, and family. ""(and for which I am eternally greatful)."" And, ""(which I adore to this day)."" @CAPS1 wouldn't have added the use things in unless @CAPS1 truly meant it, and if @CAPS1 really loved his home. Also what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how @CAPS1 is grateful for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In Rodriguez's memoir, it has a happy and loving tone throughout it."
"""There ain't no reason to get excited""   Ah, the thief, you know he kindly spoke   Well, now there are those among us right here, right now   Who still see life as some kind of a joke   But you and I, we have been through that   I tell you that this, this is not our fate, no no no   Now, let us all not talk falsely now   You know the hour, well, it's getting late   I said all along the watchtower, the princes, they kept the view   While the women, the women, they came and then they went   Oh, and the barefoot servants too, that's me, that's you   But outside there's a cold distance   Listen for the wildcats, here them growl   Two riders were approaching as the wind began to howl   Oh, there are those among us right here, right now   Who still see life as some kind of a joke   All along the watchtower, said, all along this watchtower   Those of you who still have eyes to see, ears hear me   You will be saved by grace in the end   Saved by time if you don't understand   That your hatred is rooted in your fear   And your paranoia and insecurities   Well, they don't belong here   You got to take someones hand   You got to learn to make your stand   And it's a one, two, three, four   Look at the sky, you can open the door   And take my hand, take my hand, take my hand   Ah, don't you want to touch   Don't you want to feel   Don't you know that this is real   I said shelter me, shelter me   Shelter me, shelter me   And save yourself, save yourself   Save, save, save   Save, save, save   Save, save, save   Save, save   And you, and you   And you are a part of the world   You, you, you are a part of the world   You gotta learn to touch, to feel   You know that you are real   I said, learn learn   You are a part of the world.Yeah!.Came like a gun and shot in my ear..Gotta work everyday..Yeah   ""god?"".I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive ..We can neutralize your brain..Don't help me, (help me)   I can do it and you know it..In my opinion I think that the author sets a loving mood. Here are my points to consider. First of all he explains how much he loves his parents. An elaboration of my point is that he uses strong words to show that he loves them alot. For example ""I've often told them of my admiration for thier strength.""@CAPS1 of all he talks about his family and the love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had. For example ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language."" @CAPS2 of all he explains how much his house meant to him. He talks about the memories he had there. For example ""I will never forget that house...  or the many things I learned there"". In conclusion thats why I think the author sets a loving mood."
"Way hey and a way we go donkey riding donkey riding,   Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey..Let's sing of the good days   And drink to the ladies   Till the whisky's all gone   And their pleasure is mine   Come sit here beside me   Sweet lullaby me   This West Texas cowboy is wrestless again.....I said, Oh what a shame when they try to pretend..They say we're crazy..I don't give a damn..I'd best keep out of town, and worry you no more   For, maybe someone else has made you care      Have all of my dreams gone wrong?.Three, five, zero, one, two, five go!.Yes you are!.The mood in this story is more of a positive mood. Because the auther is talking about his home and how he loves it. And how he is praising his parents for takeing a chance in america. but it could be a bad mood because they had to leave their friends behind, but they made it to america and they are a faimly and home."

But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir. "
"It wasn't me who made you go, though..Hey, I've got a guitar, I've got a fiddle   I'll sing the low part, I'll sing the middle   Rosin up the bow and let's pick a little   Got a fiddle and guitar band..Alright!.Come and adore him, Jesus our Savior,   He dwells among us, now and forever..I spent a little time on the mountain,   I spent a little time on the hill,   I heard some say ""Better run away"",   Others say ""Better stand still""..Shut up!.Hold on tight, call my name,   Don't get caught in the midnight rain....In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood for the story. The mood for his story is bittersweet. It is happy, but slightly sad. One way is is shown when @CAPS1 mentions his grand parents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grand parents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It @CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", @CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life.Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It @CAPS2 that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

In the memoir, he talks about the house he grew up in and the love in his home. Rodriguez describes the warmth of his kitchen and every thing that went on in it. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez also describes the conection between the family and friends around him, ""countless extended family members came and went...My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (paragraph @NUM2).With all of the love in this memoir, there is also a serious tone when the author describes the difficulties his parents had to face, to give him the best life that he could have. You can tell that Rodriguez has great respect for his parents."

The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir."

The mood created by the author in the memoir was sad because he grew up as a poor boy his family had no money too he was living in a @NUM1 bedroom apartment in New Jersey they were living a heart of which was a kitchen and his parent were both sharing a cooking duties but his parents still remember the traditional way they act in cuba they were in a very poor house it was a refugee place here all refugee live after he thought about going to school and helping his family After he started going to school and he started learning lot's of stuff about love and other stuff and he started learning @CAPS1 because he didn't know how to speak @CAPS1 then he started learning it and he lived in a house thats where he celebrate his birthday at it was very small it was the size of the kitchen and he said he will always be grateful to his family for doing so great things for him and thats the time he was very young he was very proud and he said he will be always be to his parents for there love and sacrifice he told his parent that he admired them for there strength and courag and perseverance so it was a very sad life for him and his parents"

"Yeah days days days days days days days days      Ya get up in the morning and turn the shower on   You're gettin' pneumonia--the hot, hot water is gone   Freezin', sneezin'   You wanna dry your back and, well   Didja' ever get one of them days   When there's no towel on the rack?.Whenever skies look gray to me,   And trouble begins to brew   Whenever the winter winds become too strong,   I concentrate on you!.Ooh, fella, now I'm buzzin'..From my once upon a time album   A song about two people who fell in love   Showing up one day face to face      Well he searched and searched for nights and days   Till he found the one he loved   And he wrapped her in his arms again   And then he thanked the stars above   That he found what he'd been looking for   And he stared her in the eyes      He said ""I love you""   Yes, I really do      Love you, love you, love you, love you      She stared him right back in the eyes   With a look of disbelief   Then she gazed off into somewhere else   Was it real or just a dream?.The club can't even handle me right now   (Put your hands up!).Write me a royal-blue parchment poem   Draw me a royal-blue lady like me   Draw me a smile   That's a lot like my own   And make my eyes flowers   And make my mind see   I will weave melodies only for you   And color them silver and saffron and blue      Build me a window to watch everything   Leave it unshuttered so nothing slips by   No season, no sorrow, no wonderful thing   No raspberry, strawberry sun in the sky   I will bring music and marsipan bars   And live deep inside you   Wherever you are      Teach me the ways of the Gemini twin   Show me the love that he says without words   Bring me his laughter again and again   The silence is singing, the quiet is heard   I will find harmonies waiting unsung   With two souls to sing them   Where once there was one.Free fall, free fall, all through life      If you love me then let go of me   I won't be held down by who I used to be      If you love me then let go of me   I won't be held down by who I was      If you love me then let go of me   I won't be held down by who I used to be.Might as well have fun,   Have fun in this life..Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon."
"First word learned was the word no!.Yeah, it is the simple things that I love about this place   Sunshine and Mexican booze on Christmas day   Oh, the noise from the city is the only way I can fall asleep   I think I needed leave to realize that this is all,   This is where I'm supposed to be   Oh oh ooh      We come from the south, we're lost out in the cold   We fight for the light, it's the only way we know   Wanna find a better sun, I wanna find a better shine   Wanna find a better world, wanna find me a better life   I wanna find a place to hide inside the violence and the rage   Of the Santa Ana wind on a winter's day      I can almost see the future   I can almost see the blue sky in the middle of the day   Even though our hell is coming down around me now   My Santa Ana wind made the clouds all blow away...Heart of mine you know that she'll never be true   She'll only give to others the love that she's gotten from you   Don't let her know   Don't let her know where you're going   Don't untie the ties that bind   Heart of mine..Pardon me that was rude   If you just started ballin' I say I'm bout to conclude   What more is there to do?.Skin and bones   Skin and bones   Skin and bones   Don't you know?.I'm hypnotised   And helpless   Beneath the pale   Full moon   My body is your sacrifice   You spirit's coming soon      I stare up at a   Squalid night      It's been so cold   And smooth   Turns tender kisses   Into bites   As you begin to move      You look so weak   And fragile   You seem to drip   And sway   But you swept me up into   Your arms   And carried me away      I'm living bad dreams   I can't run from you   I'm living bad dreams   This nightmare's   Coming true      You led me to temptation   Delivered me to pain   I walked upon you   Hallowed ground   My soul is yours to gain      Your passion drains   My energy   Fear starts running deep   I'm falling in   Slow motion   Into eternal sleep      I'm living bad dreams   I can't run from you   I'm living bad dreams   This nightmare's   Coming true      [Lead Break]      Your passion drains   My energy   Fear starts running deep   I'm falling in   Slow motion   Into eternal sleep      I'm living bad dreams   I can't run from you   I'm living bad dreams   There's nothing   I can do      I'm living bad dreams   I can't run from you   I'm living bad dreams   This nightmare's   Coming true      I'm living bad dreams   Ohh ohh   I don't want bad dreams   Living bad dreams.Getting dressed and bunger bound   Shuffling through the heather   Neighbors drop their flowers down and worry about the weather   Every night I'm floating over you my love   Every night I dream I'm under you   All the smiling hands delivering all the ???.The, mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1 nothing really happens so there is no real feeling. About half way through the @NUM2 paragraph was when the memoir started to get very @CAPS1. It is really @CAPS1 because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It says in paragraph @NUM3 that they are neighborhood was made up of, ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really @CAPS2 that those cultures could be in a friendly neighborhood during those times. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1 when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout the entire memoir."

The mood of the author of the story is happy and sad.

Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This is what happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone. "

One time that the author created a mood was when he described a traditional cuban home. In which the kitchen is the heart of the home. Also when the cuban music mixes with the aromas of the kitchen. This gives off the mood of hunger for great food. Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community. This shows how the author grew up helping people. While being helped in return. This gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people. His family always helped people who were considered family to them. This creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them. Clearly, there are many times when the authour creates a mood for the reader."

The author uses many kind, gracious words to describe his family and uses things from what we picture as an ideal family to create an even more colorful image for us to see. He uses imagery and sensory language; which helps us feel I homey atmosphere when we read. In the neighborhood he lived in, ""... all of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship,"" and that shows how close everyone was to one another and how rich of cultures that had come together. (Â¶@NUM1 line @NUM1) @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM3, the author explains how grateful he is to his parents which showed him the lessons which became the root of his life. As most children experience through their lives, they are greatly influenced by their parents. To have his parents teachings be the basis of his life, he must have had a deep connection with them. As he talks about his home and that his ...

It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back."

Narciso Rodriguez tells us of how his parents came to the states and after living in a small, one room apartment for a while were able to move in to a three room apartment where he was born. He speaks of how is home was decorated in the traditional style, about the Cuban music always playing and of how his parents taught him to cook. Rodriguez also tells us of his diverse neighbor hood but of how they all came together in unity. Everyone cared for one other and they helped whoever was a need. If someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others. The memoir depicts that Narciso Rodriguez grew up in the love of his family."
"There ain't nothing left for saying   'cause there no way that I'll be staying   You tell me to remember when I told you that I'd never walk away..What up lil' braw..It's alright that you cry if you're lonely sometime,   No matter who's by your side,   Cause the love that you look for is inside us all,   But it's something you have to find      And I'd set my sights on finding you   And I'm staying forever, you know it's true..Said I don't want to be a fool (ever again)   No way, (I mean no more) Never again (Oo, no never)   I can't be a fool, can't be..Turned my back, when I first saw you..If you wanna good surprise,   I can do that for you..Kiss me 'cause it feels like a hit..We're damaged goods..The mood created by the author is loving because it talks about how generous and caring his family is. ""... @LOCATION1 graced our kitchen table for meals..."" That quote gives you an idea of how close everybody is ""...family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.""  @CAPS1 around Narciso treats him like family. He learned what family really ment by living in this house during his childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In the memoir you can see how Narciso loves his family and friends. Overall the main mood of this memoir is loving."

It makes you think of your own family."

In the selection Narciso shows that he is thankful for being cuban living in the united states. His parents moved to Newark, New Jersey after living in cuba  to give their children a better like. Narciso has ""a love of cooking"" because he was raised with his parents both cooking and having cullinary skills he was passionate of cuban music which ""filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". To Narciso Growing up in his envirenment family had nothing to do with blood relative and, was more as someone who  you think of as to being like family. For Narciso there was no way for him to show the gratitude and generosity that he got in such an early age. And how important he learned that family and friends are."
"Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh   Tonight I'm gonna loose ?.Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,   He spoke to me, I took his flute..Procrastination, the small conversation   The tensions beginning to build up inside   No one elses point of view   Has ever been to what you think is right   that's why no body is your friend   But they'll always become   One someday as she follows me   Is now business that you run   wondering what went wrong   Wondering just how long the road ahead will be   Joy has compromised   Dying on the I's crossing the t's   one out of one   Its a relization of peoples reflection   Of what you believe   anyone who now looks back   Be ready to die   The fought will change   so please don't get me wrong   We share our common goals   Inside of me sees how you are   So go one with the show   wondering what went wrong   Wondering just how long the road ahead will be   Joy has compromised   Dying on the I's crossing the t's   see where it gets us   Well see where we hang out   But nothing can keep me from this way   Look at the sins and banged up poverty   Like which you remain in   I won't buy what your selling   I feel my eye repairing   Always makes a chance   To be seen.Listen to me, you little puke..And turned the whole neighborhood upside down   Where were you, little girl I say?.Love is all you need      (Yesterday)   (Oh yeah)   (She love you, yeah, yeah, yeah)   (She love you, yeah, yeah, yeah)   (Oh, yesterday).I'm coming to worship   I'm coming to bow down   I'm coming to be with you............   (repeats till faded out).The vows that we make are only to break   We drift like a wave from the shore   The kisses we steal we know are not real   So why should we try anymore?.The mood is well many different things. But mainly the mood is loving. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the begining and end, Narciso talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in that sentence you can see that both Narciso's mother and father would always welcome people into their house."

It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feas (Albeit a frugal Cuban feas) always filled the air with not Just scent an music but life and love. it was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house towards gracious neighborhood or the many things I learne there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn the simple house into a home."
"You and I together, hand and hand   We run away, far away   I'll beat that nasty weather   But I'll take whatever you can   Give that comes my way, yeah, far away      Let's go fucking crazy      Well,I toss and turn all night   Thinking of your ways of affection   But to find that it's not different at all   Well I throw away my past mistakes   And contemplate my future   That's when I say, what the hey      Would it last forever?.There she stands, this lovely creature   There she stands, there she stands   With her hair full of ribbons   And green gloves on her hands   So I asked this lovely creature   Yes, I asked..Everybody live for the music-go-round..I kept track of all the love that I gave him   And on paper, well, it looked pretty good   He left a note that said he couldn't stay here   As if I could....You thought I was stupid   But now I stop (stop!).Would he treat you like I would?.All beings to burn to break to break to break      Wave goodbye, wish me well   I've become, something else (something else, something else, just as well)      But this thing that lives inside of me   Will surely rise awake awake awake awake awake   And the sead that brekas right through to me   And it comes to grab and take and take and take and take      I am home, I believe   I am home, I am free   I am home, I can see   Always here, finally      I am home, I believe   I am home, I am free.She call me officer I hit her with my nightstick   My swag so mean, anger management   You call it what you want, I'm on some mo' eleven shit   These niggas wanna hate, godammit we can handle it   Mad 'cause I got juice, call me Tropicana bitch   Joc feel good..In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is calm and they are happy. I think this because they talk mainly about the good thing in their childhood. They also say how much they loved thier family. If you don't love or have a family as a child you would not be happ and they were. My last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home. This is why I think the authors mood is happy and calm."
"All the lonely people, where do they all belong?.Now I will never be the same,   Spirit of God, my life You've changed,   And I'll forever sing Your praise,   I live to know You, Lord..I don't wait around for you..The rich man drives his car past,   The poor man on bare feet..You hijo de puta!.And he can see no reason, 'cause there are no reasons,   What reason do you need to be sho-wn...

First, Narciso loved his parents and was very grateful for everything they did. Rodriguez says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@NUM1). Narciso's parents came to the US just for him and he is so grateful. Secondly, he says he has thanked them so many times but he doesn't know how. Rodriguez says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me"" (@NUM1). He is so thankful he doesn't even know how to put it in words @CAPS1, Narciso knows even though they only had a three â€“ room apartment he knew it was special. Narciso states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). His parents couldnt give him much because they didn't have much money but it meant the world to him Clearly, the mood of this passage is gratitude"
"Well when you're down on your luck and you ain't got a buck in London you're a goner   Even London Bridge has fallen down and moved to Arizona   Now I know why and I'll substantiate the rumor that the English sense of humor   Is drier than the Texas sand   You can put up your dukes or you can bet your boots but I'm leavin' as fast as I can   I want to go home with the armadillo good country music from Amarillo and Abilene   The friendliest people and the prettiest women you've ever seen   Well it's cold over here Lord I swear I wish they'd turn the heat on   And where in the world is that English girl I promised I would meet on the third floor   And of the whole damn lot the only friend I got is a smoke and a cheal guitar   My mind keeps rollin' and my heart keeps yearnin' to be home in Texas bar   I want to go home with the armadillo...

In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love."

When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood-related to you I think of my friends and the people I can count on. They are my family too. He also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home, not without memories, your family, and something or someone that you trust. Lastly, he tells us about how greatful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love. This piece makes me think about and appreciate my family, and my home."

I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride"

The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is full of pride for being Cuban. In @LOCATION1 two he states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents ""rich culinary skills and a love of cooking"" passed on to him. Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful. In the very last sentence it is noticeable. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""

This mood is portrayed in many ways. One way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about @PERSON1's parents. And how there home is always open or how theres always ton of people at the dinner table. Another way they portrayed this mood is by @PERSON1 stating ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are. This is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1."

The mood in the story is very happy. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family not just a home."
"Well, you robbed me out of my silver, Lord, and out of my gold   Ever since you been a-ridin' by side..This is absurd..I'm ready for lonely fun times, yeah   Loud music may dull my mind   Black coffee and electric sunshine   Get set for this pantomime..Don't you wim wam worry if my train is late,   On the shim sham shuttle on a frim fram freight,      'Cause your bim bam baby is coming home tonight..[Chorus]   Me and Jesus, got our own thing goin'   Me and Jesus, got it all worked out   Me and Jesus, got our own thing goin'   We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about      [1st Verse]   I know a man, who once was a sinner   I know a man, who once was a drunk   And I know a man, who once was a looser   He went out one day and made an alter out of a stump      [2nd Verse]   Jesus brought me through all of my troubles   Jesus brought me through all of my trials   Jesus brought me through all of my heartaches   And I know that Jesus ain't gonna' forsake me now      [Chorus]      [3rd Verse]   We can't afford any fancy preachin'   We can't afford any fancy church   We can't afford any fancy singin'   You know Jesus got a lot of poor people out doin' his work      [Chorus].I'm right here, cause I need   Little love, a little sympathy   Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright   Need a little sweetness in my life   Your sugar, yes please   Would you come and put it down on me?.The first thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin'   And the youngest dream of growin' up to ride   On a freight train leavin' town not knowin' where I'm bound   No one could change my mind but mama tried   One and only rebel child for my family meek and mild   My mama seemed to know what lay in store   Spite of all my Sunday learnin' toward the bad I kept on turnin'   Till mama couldn't hold me anymore   And I turned twenty one in prison doing life without parole   No one could steer me right but mama tried mama tried   Mama tried to raise me better but her pleadings I denied   That leaves only me to blame cause mama tried      Dear old daddy rest his soul left my mama heavy load   She tried so very hard to fill his shoes   Working hours without rest wanted me to have the best   She tried to raise me right but I refused   And I turned twenty one in prison...

In the beginning of the memoir, @PERSON1 describes his home, about how it started to how it became a wonderful ""home"". He said it had ""a passionate Cuban music"" and ""amazing aromas of cooking"". Then in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 says that ""he loves his parents for their love and sacrifice""; and he continues saying how grateful he is toward them. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This is the mood expressed in the memoir."

Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house."

And How all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family. How his parent turn a regluar house into home that he loved. He was grateful how his parent made so many sacrifice that turn something into life time expenence that he will never forget. He was happy how little thing turn it great memories, that he can't wait to tell the world."

The memoir was all about how Narciso Rodriguez admired his parents courage, selfishness, culture, heritage, strength, and perseverance.  Narciso said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" @CAPS1 also said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up. The memoir focused on how @CAPS1 is so greatful for everything his parents did and sacrificed for him. In conclusion, the mood created by the author of the memoir was happy and greatful."

Happieness is one of the mood because Narciso is pleased with parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and secrifice."".  @CAPS1 is one of the moods because all every one in the neighbor hood got along.

Other people it's a new oppertunitie to meet new people a better job, or go to a better @CAPS2 for your education. I understand it is hard to move from cuba to the united States. Thats across the world not a town over or a street down. But he made a friend and his mom and dad love him very much. They always have food on the table so at lest they dont starve.

It is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family. This gives the story a very loving mood and shows how they are all there for each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to lif in our warm home."" This sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very greatful. He is always saying how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to @LOCATION1 to create a better life for him. That is the mood of the memoir throughout the whole passage."

""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich  culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This quote shows that the mood was cheerful and calm. The mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house. The author made the mood like an instilled enviroement as like he was growing up in ""this environment instilled in me a great sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."

In the memoir Narciso said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. to add, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness. In closing I would like to say Narciso Rodriguez is a very grateful and serious man."
"I'm your's for life baybe!.Are you telling me this is a sign?.Put me back in the cold   I'm going to Antarctica   It feels like these days,   Our old meeting place,   In an LA cafe   Or on the Serengeti,   The hunt has not Begun..Bet you can't guess how much I paid   That's a shame   Fuck these simple hoes tryna swerve in my lane      [Post-Hook]   Do it for the niggas   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Do it, do it, do it, do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Do it for the niggas   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Nah I ain't gon' do it      [Bridge]   He said, ""Arch your back""   I ain't gon' do it   He said, ""Kiss my neck""   I ain't gon' do it   Talk dirty in my ear   I ain't gon' do it   Do it, do it, do it, do it   He said, ""Arch your back""   I ain't gon' do it   He said, ""Kiss my neck""   I ain't gon' do it   Talk dirty in my ear   I ain't gon' do it   I'ma need some fresh air, bitch      [Hook]   Gold in my champagne   Your shit blank, boy your shit lame   Probably just like your dick game   So I don't need to know your name   Don't you see these on my feet?.Is all tha world jails and churches?.If I wasn't a fly on the wall   I wouldn't know all about you      I'm everything and everywhere   Can you see me in your own reflection?.Cause in every land there's a woman for every man..Everybody knows their names   (oooooh, ahhhhhh)   (ahhhhh, ohhhhhh)      Verse 2   Whenever they came around   Everyone else would leave   But they didn't even pay 'em no heed   Just walked on hand in hand   If there were meadows and gardens there   I'm sure they would have been   Frolickin' and playin' all day long   Mindin' their own buisness      [Chorus:]      Bridge   Ooh-wee!. The mood created by the auther is that of the american dream. It is a very happy and successfull theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had simallar stories. In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious. This short memoir is a great story to bring you mood from sad to hopefull and thankfull that you live in a place you can call home."

This is shown when he says ""In reality there is no way to show how greatful of my Family I am. This show that he shows and respect all of his Family."
"His spit is worth more than her work   Pass the purse to the pugilists   He's a prizefighter   And he bought rings and he owns kin   And now he's swingin'   And now he's the champion   Hey revolver, don't mothers make good fathers?.Could have skipped the slide, but you did not try..How many will you take?.And their faiths are falling down, down, down, down..I know she's not as strong as she seems....Chorus:   God be with you..Nothing can please me only thoughts are of you   You just laughed when I begged you to stay   I've not stopped crying since you went away      The world is a lonely place - you're on your own   Guess I will go home - sit down and moan..The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez is eternally grateful to have the rich culinary skills and a love for cooking just like his Parents. His very happy he came from such friendly family. The community and @ORGANIZATION1 comes together to help out those who needs a hand. Rodriguez is grateful to his Parents for their love and sacrifice, and he thanks them repeatedly. His Parents have there arms and doors open to those who will do the same for them."
"It's just a question of controlling   For whom the bell is tolling..I only have one serious bone in my body   You..Waking in the dead of night   Hold onto this life   Running to what's wrong or right   Seems to be a thin line   Fighting for a wasted love   Fighting to survive   Oh won't you please forget   Won't you please forget      These are the dog days   These are the dog days   They'll never go away   These are the dog days   These are the dog days   They'll never go away      1, 2, 3, 4   What are you waiting for?.This body holding me..I ain't s'posed to be just fun   Oh, to live and die, let it be done   I figure I'll be damned, all alone like I began....And she throws her hands out so fast..I'm alive   'Cause Jesus gave me life   He opened up my eyes   I can see clearly now      Oh, everybody dance now, oh      Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us   Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Praise His name      My desire   Is to lift You higher   It's only burning brighter   This passion inside of me      Oh, everybody dance now, oh      Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us   Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Praise His name   [x2]      This praise is bursting out   And I can't contain it now   This praise is bursting out   Out, out, 1, 2, let's go      Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Give Him glory, for He has redeemed us   Everybody, give it up for Jesus   Praise His name   [x2].And feel inside so free..The mood created by the author is very greatfull and thankful. The author shows how greatful and thankful they are in this memoir When they said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their Strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me With their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life.""- In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful."
"Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home   If I had one wish, I wish I could   Go back to my old neighborhood   Where the good folks they all love you as their own   Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house   Knock on the door 'n they'd all sing out   Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home      I'd sing their praises long and loud   Cause their all my folks and I'm mighty proud   Of the little old town back home where I was born   I wish that I could hear them say   In the good old-fashioned, friendly way   Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home      Well, they don't lock their doors at night   'Cause they all know they're a-doin' right   And the good lord's bound to have them for his own   If I'd go back to hear them pray   In the little pine church, they all would say   Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home      When I was a child of only three   I said my prayers at my mother's knee   And I knew right then from god I'd never roam   When I get my summons on the judgment day   I hope I can hear my savior say   Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home   Now, come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home.Sing la la la la   La-la-la-la   La la la la   La-la-la-la   La la la la   La-la-la-la   La la      I am the passenger   Yeah I ride and I ride   I ride through the city at night   I ride through this torn-down side   And everything is yours and mine   Mark out what's yours and mine   We'll make what's yours and mine tonight   We'll make what's yours and mine tonight      Everything will be alright   Yeah everything will be alright   Everything will be alright tonight..The lunatic is in the hall..Does it matter much, does it matter much to you?.Oh!.I should have seen it coming,   I should have known what to expect..Killing spree, first degree,   I shut the world outside..the way your circumstance would be?.In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good."

Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1 and try to find new jobs and start new lives. Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir."
"There's a catchword getting all the craze, it's the latest phrase,   Everybody says: hold tight keep your sets please   No one knows just why it first broke out, what it's all about   Why do people shout..Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,   Don't stop, it'll soon be here,   It'll be, better than before,   Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone..Lord I'm just thinking 'bout a certain female..Some say we're the land of misfit toys   An insane mix of girls and boys   Nothing really changes, like a stretch of sand time forgot      That's just livin', that's just livin'   That's just livin' life on a rock, yea      Well you don't lose your lover, you just lose your turn   Drivin' on the left side gotta be learned   Happy hour's from 3 to 6 but it never really stops      That's just livin', that's just livin'   That's just livin' life on a rock, yea      We got Rasta religions, and parrots and pigeons   Mango and salt on a stick   Life is a lime and from time to time   I gotta go get my fix, yea      We roll with the flow, friends come and go   Usually by the edge of the dock      That's just livin', that's just livin'   That's just livin' life on a rock, yea   Oh, I love livin', I love livin'   I love livin' life on a rock, yea      Life on a rock   Yeah yeah   Yeah yeah   I love livin'   Life on a rock.Can you hear them   They talk about us   They're telling lies   Well, that's no surprise   Can you see them   See right through them   Yeah that happens to you   Nothing gets through for you   Doesn't matter what they say   In the jealous games people play   Yes, our lips are sealed      When we walk by   Then we must chose   In our defense   Silence   When you look at them   Look right through them   That's when they'll disappear   That's when we'll be feared   Doesn't matter what they say   In the jealous games people play   Yes, our lips are sealed      Pay no mind to what they say   It doesn't matter anyway   Hey hey hey   Our lips are sealed      Hush my darling, don't you cry   Quiet, angel, forget their lies      Can you hear them   They talk about us   Telling lies, telling lies   That's no surprise   Can you see them   See right through them   Yeah that happens to you   Nothing gets through for you   Doesn't matter what they say   In the jealous games people play   Yes, our lips are sealed   Pay no mind to what they say   It doesn't matter anyway   Hey hey hey   Yes, our lips are sealed.But now I'm lost in the crowd,   No shadow of a doubt   It's all over now,   No shadow of a doubt..But now the cat comes in for the kill,   His paw is raised, soon blood will spill, yes it will..Corrina, Corrina,   Gal, where you been so long?.The mood in the memoir swifts throughout the story.  First is that in the begin Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different.  But that changed when they started having family over and also using there imagination to decorte there house.  Next is that the mood change in the middle of the memoir when they rellized you can have just a good life in @LOCATION1 then you can anywhere else.  Also, by them having there family with them while in @LOCATION1 made there moods more positive.  Lastly the family's mood was negitive when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made there house into a home there mood change immeditly and they were happy in @LOCATION2.  Thats the mood created by the author in the memoir."
"(In Jamaica, y'all) Get things together, right now!.[Verse 1]   I'd rather be smoking weed   Whenever we breathe   Everytime you kiss me   Don't say that you miss me   Just come get me      [Hook]   Don't know why, just know I want to   Don't know why, just know I want you      [Verse 2]   I'd rather be breaking things   Cause we can't see   We're too busy kissing   Just making scenes   Here come the police   They know about your history   How you live and love like ""fuck rules""?.Grey matter grey matter ooh ..Here we are as in olden days,   Happy golden days of yore..Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue..Well, I've got open eyes,   And an open door,   But I don't know what I'm searching for..You'd better run, you'd better fly..She wanna pearl necklace..In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!"

I think the mood in this storie was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage. And learn about all the cooking. He seems to have had a very nice childhood and has always thanked his parents for that. they gave up everything to go to america to raise him and he seens very grateful."

The memoir show a pasionate explination of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents Came to the land of @LOCATION1. It shows how happy he is that he can live in @LOCATION1, and lead his own life. He is, and will always be, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life. His gratefulness also affects how his parents raised him, as a Cuban. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is grateful for his family."
"Of talent and precision..Someday I'm goin'   Where eyes are glowin'   And lips were made to kiss,   To see somebody in the moonlight   And hear the songs I missed..She likes it hot   She likes a tan   She steals my infra red when I'm gone   Oh no can it be   We're heading for a heatwave      Her legs are brown   A trace of rust   She's in love with a mkii deluxe   Oh no can it be we're heading for a heatwave      Her hair is bleached like it's been boiled   She browns herself in a sea of olive oil   And I come around and she's relaxing   In the conservatory.Would'ya, for a honeymoon in Bali?.I got a late start..A cry in the night I'm still hearing   No my love is gone I must be dreaming   Lost in the mist of passions strange   Wiping the tears I recall the pain   Of love and laughter, joy now slain   When your world turns cold won't you call my name      Come on   Cry out in the dark   I'll be by your side to give you warmth   And light and shield you from the night   Hold on, hold on, we'll fan the flames of love   Together again, just you and I      I watched the faces in the fire   No emotion was ever there   If this is truth then who's the liar?.He's over there lookin' at me   He can't talk because he's a pony   I think it's his lung      Mister, would you please help my pony?.Of the time when we would meet   Again?.The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains were he lived as a child very vividly. from the air mixed with the aromas of cuban food to to cuban music the author still loves today. It seems like he had a good childhood. He says his parent were selfless and took in refugees in their home. It gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad. He make the story very personal with all the family members he explains. His parent, did the very best they could for their family. That is how the mood is set."

Learning to be my other wing...The same time tomorrow,   there'll be another magic..In the memoir what was the mood created by the author.First, I feel that the mood created by the author is both happy and sad. I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. They also struggled both personaly and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. Although they were sad I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was there home and each other because they have there home Just as they like like, like when they were back home. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir."
"And yet, Nemorino believes the ""Elixir"" will work..I'm in conversation miles away..Gotta keep hoping for love      What is love?.I don't wanna think about it,   don't wanna think clear, don't analyze what I'm doing here..When I'm close to you..I used to lose floating memories, found myself   Wishing I'd remember old times..Well, the blind man, he stood on the way and cried   Blind man, he stood on the way and cried   Blind man stood on the way and cried,      Crying, ""oh, show me the way, show me the way,   Show me the way, the way to go home. "".And if only fools are kind, Alfie,   Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.. The mood created by the author is love and @CAPS1. Because the author talks about how growing up was. The author helps babysitting. And the author sounds like a nice person. thats what the author's mood is."
"Give me a wave, I can ride upon   Come and show yer strength to me   I have felt the final rush of love's embrace   The magic touch, running headlong to attract   I felt the breath of Satan on my back   Is there someone I can believe in?.Well you've got me dancing in a figure of eight,   Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late..The girl that you were dating   Keep all your ?.I'm off again in my World.Oh, can't you see, there's somebody else   You never showed it, you should have known it      You've been in love, yeah you've been in love   You've been in love, yeah you've been in love      Going round singing all those love songs, songs you haven't heard for years   You're gonna have to ask her why she's so happy   You'd better run, find out what's going through her mind..From the window of our honeymoon   The night looks a might bizarre   They're burning us in effigy   And smoke's blots out the stars      They're torturing our servants   By the light of an armoured car   Please don't ask if it's the end of the line   As I never could see that far      Tonight I'd rather look at you   How beautiful you are   If they ask you ""what are lovers""   Tell them ""lovers are      Set against the order   We live outside the law""   I'm no hero under torture   I'll tell them all I heard and saw      I saw everything in you, my love   How beautiful you are      Through a broken telescope   We focus on the stars   I don't want my vision magnified   I don't need to see that far      From the window of our honeymoon   Draw the curtains cross the bars   Let's spare ourselves the spectacle   The problem's theirs not ours   Tonight I'd rather look at you      How beautiful you are   How beautiful you are   How beautiful   How beautiful   How beautiful you are   You are.And the power surge,   Driven by the light!.Somehow two lovers get a chance   At a beautiful romance   And you wish it could be you..The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy."

In this memoir is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He shows apreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds. At one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done. He tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are."

For example his @CAPS1 worked in a labortory in cuba, and his mom was studying chemical @CAPS2 and they left that to live in Newark, @ORGANIZATION1.

The mood is also happy because everyone loved eachother. They didnt have the nicest home, but it was full of love. The music was always playing and Family came a lot. The door was always open in the Rodriguez house. The last sentence in this memoir ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made me smile it was so beautiful. This is how the mood was happy and made me thankful. The next time I see my grand parents I will make shure to thank them for moving to the @CAPS2.S and giving are Family a better life."
"We've got a nice little house on a quiet little street   But it don't matter   A two garage with a new Cherokee   But it don't matter      [Chorus]   Cause we don't ever seem to talk anymore   And you don't hold me like you did before   We've got everything we wanted and more   But now I know and now I see   Nothing matters if you don't love me      We've given twelve precious years of our lives   But it don't matter   And I guess for awhile we were both satisfied   But it don't matter   It wouldn't be easy to walk out tonight   But it don't matter   And I know I would miss you if you said goodbye   But it don't matter.And if losin you is what i gotta do to satisfy all my needs then i guess that makes me guilty         Tonight you'll cry   Ain't nothing more   That's why deicided to sing this song 'bout   I'm fakin'   Girls hearts breakin   I was up beatin' and screaming 'n faking   You sit there say I'm filthy when you're the one who made me guilty      Guilty x7      But you pushed your luck, now it's all messed up   But ya went to far when ya broke my heart and i found my guy..I been meek   And hard like an oak   I seen pretty people disappear like smoke..And how long will we hear people speaking   About missiles for peace   And just let it go by   How long will they tell us these weapons   Are keeping us free   That's a lie      If you saw it from a satellite   With its green and its blue and white   The beauty of the curve of the earth   And its oceans below   You might think that it's turning   But it's turning so slow      How long can you hear someone crying   How long can you hear someone dying   Before you ask yourself why?.If I believe in paradise,   I swear I must be there..So sick of you stressin'   Sick of you fessin'   Sick of you actin' like I owe you some   Find another place to feed your face   If you don't we gonna bump, get it up, get crunk..I couldn't stand it anymore..Oh   Pick me, pick me yea   Live alone, lone single   Atleast, atleast yea   Everyone is hollow      Pick me, pick me yea   Everyone is waiting   Pick me pick me yea   You can be the baby      Hey   Dive   Dive   Dive   Dive in me   Dive   Dive   Dive   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me      Kiss this, kiss that yea   Live alone, lone single   Atleast, atleast yea   You could be my hero      Pick me, pick me yea   Everyone is waiting   Hit me, hit me yea   I'm real good at hitting      Hey   Dive   Dive   Dive   Dive in me   Dive   Dive   Dive   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me      Dive   Dive   Dive   Dive in me   Dive   Dive   Dive   Dive in me   Dive   Dive   Dive   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me   Dive in me.In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives it talks about this fashion designers life. One example is in paragraph @NUM1 page @NUM2 it talks about his backround Narciso states ""My parent, originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956..."" The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names. Nex it is paragraph @NUM3 page @NUM2. This sets the mood of him growing up in a new inviorment. For example he States ""Growing up in this new instilled in me a great ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our nieborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a tim when overt racism was the norm of segregation prevailed in the United States."" @CAPS1 is on page @NUM5 paragraph @NUM6. It shows the mood of how he loves his house. For example he says ""... I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many thing or I learned there about how to love."" In conclusion this is how the mood creates the author."
"Baby won't you change your mind?.I don't understand about complementary colors   And what they say   Side by side they both get white   Together they both get gray      But he's been pretty much yellow   And I've been cryin' blue   But all I can see is   Red, red, red, red, red now   What am I to do      I don't understand about   Diamonds and why men buy them   What's so impressive about a diamond   Except the mining      And it's dangerous work   Trying to get to you too   And I think if I didn't have to   Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it   Maybe I wouldn't listen so much to you      I've been watching all the time   And I still can't find the track   And I want to know is it okay   Is it just fine   Was it my fault   Is it my lack      I don't understand about   The weather outside   The harbinger to the words   That somebody lied      There's solace a bit for submitting   To the fitfully cryptically true   What's happened has happened   What's coming is already on its way   With a role for me to play      I don't understand   I'll never understand   But I'm trying to understand   There's nothing else I can do.And I'll tell you straight in the eye      D.I.Y..When the mist of wickedness conceals the beacon's light   And you're driftin' through the fog somewhere out in the night   The one who whispers peace be still and calms the raging sea   He is the beacon in the night, He'll rescue you and me..I can't get a job, Bernadette,   So all that I can offer are a lot of bad debts   If you marry me, Bernadette,   You'll lose the alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get..And who is the master of fox hounds?.Take me out, finish this waste of a life..Oui   Je sens le vent   Je sens la pluie   Ressens la peine      Le sang qui coule dans mes veines   Poursuit sa route   Je suis la mienne      Et c'est si simple de vivre   Et c'est si simple de vivre   Et c'est plus simple de vivre   Que t'aimer      Well it's true   I feel the wind   I feel the rain   I feel the pain   I feel the shame      Same blood running through my veins   Same beating heart   One for each mind      And it's so easy to live   And it's so easy to live   And it's so easy to love   Why don't we      We keep on running on we   From now i'm running away      Life means nothing at all   If I don't fall   In love with you.In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is respectful. First of all, Narciso's parents were very courages. When Narciso talks about his parents, he says, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). Narciso gives his parents the respect they deserve by describing their actions as ""such courage."" @CAPS1 of all, Narciso's parents wanted their kids to have a better life. When Narciso explains why his parents came to the United States, he says, ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behing their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM1). When it says ""They came...to give their children a better life"" shows that Narciso's parents love their kids so much, they did what they could to give their kids a better future, which deserves great respect. Finally, Narciso is greatful for what his parents did. When Narciso describes what he feels towards his parents, he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez paragraph @NUM3). When the author says, ""I will always be grateful"" shows that the author is thankful for what his parents did for him and therefore shows respect. All in all, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author is respectful."
"Drip, drip, drip   Baby, when'd you get so Zen?.I really don't like it...I'm leaving it to you..Do you love me?.I love you like I do   I try to tell you, doo, doo, doo   Doo, doo, loo, loo      Submitted by Michael Hack.Ohh...

Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume breathes a life of   gathering gloom..As soft as farewells whispered over the coffin..So give me my guitar back.... A mood for the memoir would be redeaming. It would be a redeaming mood because it talks about strugles like being an immagrent and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her acomplish what she has become today. Since there are tradteties that help the author lead to success it would be a redeaming mood."

[Music Fades].Lefou      More beer?.We could share the mystery, spare ourselves the misery..He panics, feels around for a stone and hurls it at the brightest   point..The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life. And how important my family is to me. It also allowed to see how full and good his was to. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells. Also, the wonderfull music that played and the people that always came over to visit. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir."
"All I can do is cry for help..How many times have you heard someone say   If I had his money I'd do things my way   Hmm, but little they know   Hmm, it's so hard to find   One man in ten with a satisfied mind..Ah you alone have that style there Daddy   The queen for England haffi love off yardie      Ah where you get that new Clarks there Daddy?.You've left me hungering for the touch of you..The steps on the stairs   Aren't really there   Feel like there's someone watching me   Shadows on the wall   Whispers down the hall   When I look there's nothing to see   You say that you let her go   Turn the page and closed the door   Can't get inside your head   'Cause when I try, she's there instead      I can't compete with a memory   How can I fight with someone that I can't see?.And why am I never gonna sleep again?.I'm beautiful, dammit!.For-sake the power      Beat on the brat   Beat on the brat   Beat on the brat with a baseball bat   Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh-oh      I beat on the brat   I beat on the brat   I beat on the brat with a baseball bat   Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh-oh      Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh-oh      What can you do?.The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and self lessness. The of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, ""It was here where I learned the true defonition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The mood for that exerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors. There were many exerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selfless ness, As such, ""They came self lessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love."" This indacates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them. The overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness, struggle, courage, good outcome, and beloved memories."
"She'll call me sugar, if she's feelin' kind of sweet,   She'll say that I'm crazy over my little jealousy..Hit me later on, and maybe we can hang..And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,   Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody..Vitals are stable      Name?.Is your heart breaking?.Open the door, enter hell's core   Black is the code for tonight..Long ago, but not so very long ago,   The world was different, oh yes it was..Sealed With A Kiss!.The mood created by the author in the memoir was a mood of admiration. I think it was a mood of admiration because Narciso admires the fact that his mother and father both left their ""families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends. I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. @CAPS1 thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This means that his parents turned a small house into a welcoming. loving place that holds so many memories."
"People say don't rock the boat,   Let things go their own way   Ideas that once seem so right,   Now have gotten hard to say   I wish I could talk to you,   You could talk to me   'Cause there's very few of us left   My friend   From the days that used to be..Will you play with me?.Saw you standing by the winding river   Saw you Standing by the shining stream   Saw you standing by the winding river   Saw you standing by the shining stream   Ancient of days, ancient of days, ancient of day a a a ays      Felt you stirring in my heart this morning   Felt you moving in my heart at night   Felt you stirring in my heart this morning   Felt you moving in my heart at night   Ancient of days, ancient of days, ancient of day a a a ays      Saw you shining in the sun this morning   Saw you shining in the starry night   Saw you shining in the sun this morning   Saw you shining in the starry night   Ancient of days, ancient of days, ancient of day a a a ays   Ancient of days, ancient of days, ancient of day a a a ays   Ancient of days, ancient of days, ancient of day a a a ays   Ancient of days, ancient of days, ancient of day a a a ays   Ancient of days, ancient of days, ancient of day a a a ays   Ancient of days, ancient of days, ancient of day a a a ays.And the jails decayed (The keys got lost)..Baby, please keep me      I need a love to keep me happy,   I need a love to keep me happy..Overbearing yes ya tryin' ta tire me   A mess!.These demons in my head tell me to      I'm lying here in bed   Swear my skin is inside out   Just another Sunday morning      Seen my diary on the newsstand   Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand   It's a shame no one is praying   'Cause these voices in my head   Keep saying      'Love, just don't stare.'.Oh boy, oh boy can't stop the fightin', no..In the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood is set right from the beginning. The first thing said to Start the mood was, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)"" This shows the author is grateful and happy. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows how the author is very proud. Also lastly the memoir mentions, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again saw how grateful the author is. In this passage the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start."

"In some hearts it's always winter,   For some hearts it seems,   That christmas never comes..It's breaking..A ruthless stalker   Slap old lady's off they walker   Take my hand little bitch,come along   It ain't that far   Welcome to the Bizzar      Anybody here?.It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas,   Things you swear you'll do before you die,   It's the city of love that waits for you,   But you're to damn scared to fly..Oh yeah..I get my lovin' on the run..This is my love for you..(Up!).The mood of this memior is slightly diffucult, somewhat depresing, yet gratefulness and now I am going to explain to you how.

He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle with getting jobs underequiped for their abilitie. His parents, he said ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"". He feels that this is one of the reasons his childhood house was turned into a home."

The author thanks his parents for their kind and loving actions. It makes the reader feel admiration towards his parents and the author is trying to create a sense of appreciation and gratitude towards his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains his appreciation for his parents; ""But in reality, there's no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such an early age and demonstration of how Important friends and family really are."" The author is also trying to create a comforting mood. When he explains the atmosphere of his home, he is trying to create a homey mood; ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is comforting and adds to the homey mood. The author is also trying to create a loving mood in the sense that he is explaining the caring acts of his parents. In paragraph @NUM3, the author describes his generous parents, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to... many people... I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3-@NUM1). This shows the generosity of his parents and the author is trying to create a loving mood. @ORGANIZATION1 develops a grateful, comforting, caring mood."

Immediately as I began to read I felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family. I felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends. As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security. However, once you continue reading and get into @CAPS1 @NUM1, the mood darkens. The author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life. I solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family. ""I'll always be grateful to my parents,"" the author writes. ""for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). He explains how much he appreciates the love and care given to him by his family. While reading this memoir, I have felt comforted, sympathetic, and a strong sense of family, as I'm sure the author had too."
"I know I said I would roll with you   Put my lifestyle on hold for you   All them sweet things that I told you   This conversation is overdue   Freeze!.When I look back, boy, I must have been green   Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream   Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign   Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind      They said, ""get back, honky cat   Better get back to the woods."".Tell you how the story stands   I'm a victim in your hands   Got me pleading on my bended knees   That's the way the picture reads   It's a horror show   It's a body blow   And it's gone too far      Tell me a reason   Well give me a sign   Somebody somewhere   Throw me a line   Somebody down there   Looking for blood   Off with the horses   Into the flood      Now you've made a big mistake   Spoiled the icing on the wedding cake   Killed the goose that laid the golden egg   This time babe you're going to have to beg   It's a crying shame   It's a dying flame   And it's gone too far      Tell me a reason   Give me a sign   Somebody somewhere   Throw me a line   Somebody down there   Looking for blood   Off with the horses   Yeah, into the flood      So you pulled the perfect crime   Turned the water into wine      Got me on my bended knees   Now's the time to make me squeeze      Came in from the freezing cold   Turned the glitter into gold (from the barbican)      It's a bloody mess   It's a body-blow   And it's gone too far.Look right through me, look right through me      And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad   The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had   I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take   When people run in circles it's a very, very   Mad world, mad world, enlarging your world   Mad world.From pools of xylophone clear   From caves of memory   I saw the children at heart   That we once used to be   Borne on foaming seahorse herd   Compose with trumpeting shell   From lines across their hands   A song as new as new moon   As old as all the sands   Shrank to stagnant from Atlantic wild   Lost that child 'til mermaid   Smiled      Summoned by drum rolling surf   As laughing fish compel   The young boy woken in me   By clanging diving bell   Breakers pillow fight the shore   She wriggles free in the tide   I'm locked in adult land   Back in the mirror she slides   Waving with comb in hand   I was lucky to remain beguiled   Grown to child since mermaid   Smiled.Jump on it!).(It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang).6:30 this morning..The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"

The author constantly talks about how his home was a wonderful place and a happy environment to live in. One example was in paragraph @NUM1. It talks about the endless celebrations and countless congregations of family and friends. This is clearly a happy thing to happen. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it talks about the wondrous joining of the different cultures in the neighborhood. It was wonderful because at that time there was much trouble with segragation and racism. It created a happy environment to live in compared to the many other towns with horrible racism and segregation. Finally, in paragraph @NUM3 it talks about how their arms and doors were open to anyone who needed them. This allowed not only them to be happy but for other people to share their happiness with them. In this memoir the mood created by the author is mostly happiness and celebration. "

I could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. To describe the mood he created in this memoir, I would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. This memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.Rodriguez starts off by describing his Cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."

[Chorus].In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times."

He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home"". Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories."

Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."

Also the mood was happy, because he said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" which is him talking about how his parents made @LOCATION1 feel like home.

The mood that was created by the @CAPS1 is that no matter if your an immigrate or not one you could make friends and have family that you love still with you and could make some friends. Another mood that he talks about is tha his parents and how they love to cook together and are selflessness too."

In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""A cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote shows how much love and caring the mood is and makes the mood a more loveing and thoughtful feeling In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love."" In This quote I felt the mood which was love and the @CAPS1 inquires it with his word choice. Also in this passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote signify's all three moods loving, caring, and the thoughtfulness of the memoir. It describes how the mood was brought on, how it was and the meanings. The mood to the story is touching with all the warmth of love brought into the house, instead of caring about the possessions with greed."

""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family. In the mood in this memoir is not just thoughtful or kind or caring, it's the feeling loved and loving that feeling. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family."""

An example of where this mood is shown is this quote from the memoir, ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is talking about how everybody in his neighborhood acted as one large family, even though people were of very different nationalities. It shows that the author had a very loving community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood. Another example is when the author states ""...I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the love he feels for his parents, his house and all the residents in the neighborhood. A third and final example of the loving mood within the memoir is when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he loves his parents for giving him oppurtunities, even when it @MONTH1 have cost them something they loved. The author created a loving mood in the memoir because that was how he remembered his childhood; Filled with love."

"They want your tears to fall   All they want is your purest sin   All they want is your heart and soul   They want to welcome you in   Innocent,   But they will lead you   Back to me..Waiting for the message I'm dreading to hear..Oh oh oh   Whatcha gonna tell your father?.No, of course not..I want my own dream   So bad I'm gonna scream      Yeah, the clock's running down   Hear the crowd gettin' loud   I'm consumed by the sound   Is it hurt?.But there's nothing in the sump   There's kids all picking   Ar the garbage dumb   I'm running out of water   So I better prime the pump   I'm trying to stay sober   But I end up drunk      We'll be eating dirt   Living on the side of the roooaaad   There's some food for thought   Kind of makes your head explode   Feeling kind of hurt   Yeah      But aaaall I hear is doooom and gloom   And aaaaall is darkness in my room   Through the night your face I see   Baby come on   Baby won't you dance with me   Yeah   Yeah   Baby won't you dance with me   I'm feeling kind of hurt   Baby won't you dance with meeeee   Yeah   Come on   Baby won't you dance with me   I'm sitting in the dirt   Baby won't you dance with me!.Then laugh..That's the way that I live and that's the way that I'll die   As a pop singer of pop songs..The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. @PERSON1 is greatul for many reasons. Some things he is greatful for is his parents his home his culture and his family. I say this because he mentioned these topics alot in the memoir. One reason he is greatful is for his parents culinary skills, As said in the memoir ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"".  Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is greatful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". The next reason @PERSON1 is greatful for his family because they are always there for him that is the reason his parents always keeps the door open to family. @PERSON1 is greatful for life and love. It was there when he learned the real definition of family, and this is why he would never forget the place he called home."

While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set!"
"Jupiter moon:   [...].Written by lindsey buckingham and christine mcvie..She wasn't looking and I wasn't looking,   Ain't it funny?.Oh, he wouldn't put his guns down..Skulking in the mean streets whispering in the halls   Red light bandits on the corner give no quarter calls   Infectious garbage fills the streets and in their eyes you know   A thin blue line bends and breaks stop the overflow      Fan the flames of the city's heat   In dark corners that you never seen   Desperation when the trouble flares   Alarm guns ring (""well I'm gonna scream"") running scared      And you're long gone, down in this hell   Long gone down in this hell   So baby won't you hold me tight   Let your softness fill my night   We've got a dream don't let it slip away   In your eyes I can see the fear   This town never sheds a tear   We're gonna be out someday walking away      People looking for the holy one,   Some kind of hero or a prophet to come   Visionaries dance the night away      There's no tomorrow living for today   But you're long gone down in this hell   Long gone down in this hell      I saw the stars come out tonight so lonely and immune   Summer rain kissed the streets that bleed like open wounds (""old balloons"")   Patrol cars sweep the avenues down on forty eighth   While faces in dark doorways wait to arouse the hate      Fan the flames of the city's heat   In dark corners that you never seen   Desperation when the trouble flares   Alarm guns ring (""well I'm gonna scream"") running scared      Baby better walk away   Baby better walk away   We'll be busting out someday      Baby better walk away   Baby better walk away   We'll be busting out someday.YEAH!.Ooh so cold      Cold Ethyl   Cold Cold Ethyl   If I live 'til ninety-seven   You'll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven      'Cause you're cool   You're ice   Cold Ethyl   You're my paradise.Love's the only rule      Might be a wrecking ball   Or just a wake up call   Don't matter where the pieces fall      Woohoo's   Woohoo's   Woohoo's      I'm gonna fly like an aeroplane   Cry like the whistle of a long black train   Dance in the pouring rain   I'm alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane   Run like its a getaway   Say those things that you shouldn't say      Where love, love's the only rule   Yes love, love's the only rule.The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"". By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading."

According to the last sentence were @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. This means that the mood is very happy and that this mood is great. @PERSON1 has many memories of the home that are positive and he also learned from what his parents taugh him. This mood in this memoir is a very positive and happy mood because the passage is about good memories and bonds between friends and family. Such as, when they first moved from cuba to the unided states to start their lifes new."

He really admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS2 of the mood is that they took their cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big @CAPS2. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall @CAPS3 in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination."
"Nothing seems to be the same   Have we forgotten all the things we knew   Was it you or I who changed?.He opened up my guitar..Cause one little Christmas tree can light up a home   So one little child can find a toy..Who shall I tell my secrets to?.Why does it always rain on me?.Why'd you do it baby?.All dressed up   No place to go   Hey monkey, when you gonna show your face around me?.Have you met Miss Jones   Someone said as we shook hands   She was just Miss Jones to me      Then I said Miss Jones   You're a girl who understand   I'm a boy who must be free..The over all mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude. A quote from paragraph @NUM1 is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that expressed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that Narciso grew up in a very warm and happy home and he is very happy and grateful for that.  Another quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" paragraph @NUM2 This shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life. A quote from paragraph @NUM3 is, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood for the many things I learned there about love."" This shows that he is so grateful to his parents for teaching him so much about life, love, and family that he would have never known if it weren't for them."

One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love. Happiness was the mood of the author because he lived in a good home, had a family full of love and care, and when he said I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."

He grew up in a traditional Cuban home where his parents cooked and he was able to get a great sense of ""family"". Not just blood relatives but everyone who would do the same as them. There was no racism within their neighborhood. They all came togather Many people, and the for dinner everynight. His parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him. His simple house was a home.

""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my badysitter and my first friend) lived above us and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not"". Alegra was @CAPS4 as a part of the family not by blood not by chose but by @CAPS5 because @CAPS6 understand the Rodriguez's family @CAPS6 liked them so @CAPS6 becacme part of there family and they became part of her family. ""Here, the innocence of childhood the Congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". When your away from Home every thing you do is different the way you sleep, eat, talk, react, is all different except when your home every thing is normal again. family isn't by blood but by heart of @CAPS5 and Home isn't where you live it's where familiy is it's where memoris are that's How the mood is set by the auther"
"Now I am crying,now I am crying   Pleasure in my heart   Never let us part for pleasure   Work,work today   Never let them pay for pleasure   Leave or lose her from my heart.Gonna jack you up,   Gonna jack you off,   Gonna jack you up yeah..But, the night just brings us back together..I'm coming home,coming home,   Coming home..Even though you will betray me   The very minute that I leave..I've been lookin' for a trace   Lookin' for a heart   Lookin' for a lover in a world   That's much too dark   Because you don't want my love, no, no   You want to sati-satisfaction   Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, ow!.!.I found myself   In a cross condition   Maybe it was her   Maybe it was me   Somethin's wrong   There was somethin' missin'   I couldn't stand to stay   So I had to leave      A half a tank of gas   Brought me this distance   Half a mind to run   Got me this far   There's a woman willin'   Where there ain't no witness   'Cept the one that lives   In my heart of hearts      My heart of hearts   Won't lie to me   It won't tell me things   That I can't believe   I better stop this thing   Before it starts   'Cause it don't feel right   To my heart of hearts      I could be tastin'   Stolen kisses   But that might   Tear my world apart   When it all comes down   To my wish of wishes   I'd have to go with   My heart of hearts      My heart of hearts   Won't lie to me   It won't tell me things   That I can't believe   I better stop this thing   Before it starts   'Cause it don't feel right   To my heart of hearts      I better stop this thing   Before it starts   'Cause it don't feel right   To my heart of hearts      My heart of hearts   Won't lie to me.The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful. First, the setting contributes to the mood. The setting of this story is in a nice little home that had a happy environment, surrounded with family and friends. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that"" family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" that quote shows that the neighborhood and the people in it all contributed to the happy mood. Second, the actions of the author's parents made the author happy and grateful. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Even though it wasn't easy for them, the author's parents @MONTH1 the sacrifice so the author could have a better life. This made the author's life happy, and the author was grateful. the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and greatful."

The @CAPS1 created a warm and welcoming feeling. They explained they're Parents troubles in the past and how they over came them. This shows courage. They describe their heritage and culture which shows confidence and honor. The @CAPS1 did a great @CAPS2 creating a comforting feeling."

Narciso writes ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 loves the people that @CAPS1 calls his family, even if they aren't really related. @CAPS1 talks about Alegria, his first friend, and Sergio and it Edelmira, his surrogate grandparents. Narciso aknowledges the fact that his parents left behind their old life and came to @LOCATION3 for him. @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 knows that his parents care about him more than they can ever express. Narciso knows that his neighborhood was a huge part of his life and proves it by writing ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" I think that overall it is an upbeat article about a man's past, where she learned the defenition of love, and how grateful @CAPS1 is to those who taught him it."
"There must be a reason why mountains are tall..I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon,   I'll blame it on the nights that could not be,   But, my heart blames it on me..Stumble in the bathroom, hung my hog a little bit..Now that you're dear to me, me      When you are close to me I shiver   When you are close to me I shiver   When you are close to me I shiver   When you are close to me I shiver      When you are close to me I shiver   When you are close to me I shiver (ooh oh, ooh oh)   When you are close to me I shiver   When you are close to me I shiver, shiver.Oooh zombie, why have you come back to life?.Or maybe you'll go crazy..Be on my side,   I'll be on your side, baby   There is no reason for you to hide   It's so hard for me   Staying here all alone   When you could be taking me   For a ride..They dropping doo-doo   I'm stepping on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe   See I'm smashing full-breaded wit no leash   When I mob, make marks across the street   See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail   For the bow-wow LBC style   Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper   On the receiver, go get it like a retriever   I want em close enough so I can lock on em   With the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em   Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em   Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten,   Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?.The mood created by the author in the memoir is very positive. I believe that the mood is positive because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 the whole memoir there is a lot of positiveness. That is the mood from the memoir."
"The police force arrived as well,   Banjoed a couple of them as well   Landed up in the douglas jail   Until the dublin boat did sail,   Deported every man..Found what I've been looking for..When someone can put a quarter in a video game   But when a homeless person approaches you on the street   You can't treat him the same      It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind   That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds   You to a doom, a fate worse than death   But there's still time left      Stop putting your conscience on cease   And bring about some type of peace   Not only in your heart, but also in your mind   It will benefit all mankind   Then there will be one thing that will never stop   And it's the evil that men do.Highlight      You're the bright side of my darkness   You remove my gloom   You picked me up when times got rough   I'm glad you had some room   To love and hold me close to your heat   To keep me safe and warm   You're the height of my desire   You set off my alarm      Chorus      I can't wait to see you   From one moment to the next   With you I never know what new thrill to expect   Your perfect sense of timing   Keeps me coming back for more   You're the spark that lights my fire   It's you that I adore      Chorus.Oh boatman, taker and giver,   Can you deliver me?.But then I overheard your prayer,   That you be this and nothing more   Than just some grateful faithful woman's favorite singing millionaire,   The patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair,   Working for the Yankee Dollar..When we come to place where the road and the sky collide   Throw me over the edge and let my spirit glide   They told me I was going to have to work for a living   But all I want to do is ride   I don't care where we're going from here   Honey, you decide      Well I spend my time at the bottom of a wishing well   And I can hear my dreams singing clear as a bell   I used to know where they ended and the world began   But now it's getting hard to tell   I could be just around the corner from heaven or a mile from hell      I'm just rolling away from yesterday   Behind a wheel of a stolen Chevrolet   I'm going to get a little higher   And see if I can hot-wire reality      Now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead?.[Chorus]      Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay together..The mood created by the author in this memoir is a very welcoming and happy one. Right off the bat Rodriguez talks about the advantages in his life. The advantage of where he lived, his heritage and his ""family"". When Rodriguez first moved into his house, he thought of it as ""a modest three- room apartment. After all the good memories shared in the apartment Rodriguez attitude about the appartment changed. ""Turned this simple house into a home. His heritage, or culture, filled the air. Some of these cultures included Cuban cooking and music. ""Which I adored to this day"" another mood setting advantage is his ""family"". Rodriguez talks about how his family was always over filling the house with laughter ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" A welcoming and happy mood is created by the author."

Narciso clearly feels very strongly about his family. He states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence alone @CAPS1 the pride and @CAPS2 in Narciso's words. The mood is happy and loving."

One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family. This shows that the mood is friendship because his parents are great friends to their family.        A second reason is the importance of friend ship. A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This show that the mood is friendship because his parents taught him friendship his whole life."

Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people."
"Farther along we'll know all about it   Farther along we'll understand why   Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine   We'll understand it all by and by..Follow the rainbow over the stream,   Follow the fellow who follows a dream,   Follow, follow, follow, follow,   Follow the yellow brick road..Eat your heart out baby   I wanna   Eat your heart out baby   Oh yeah.Oh   Oh   Oh oh oh yeah   Oh no   Yeah      Shorty ain't got cable,   She ain't even got a radio, way more than able..Savoring my piece of pie..They talk Italian to him,   And he even understands..Peek-a-boo,   Peek-a-boo, little Earth..(What?).Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir. In him memoir Narciso states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" From this statement I feel the mood is loving and kindness.     He also states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents. The last statement I thought really changed the mood was ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood when the author says that is I think thankfulness. Those are so examples of how @PERSON1 changed the mood thought out him memoir."

It is a happy mood because the author only talks about the good things that happened to him and his family. It is a very calm mood because nothing very exciting or nothing very sad happens, everything in the memoir is very calm. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is also a very kind mood because his parents are very kind. In paragraph @NUM1, ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. This shows that Narciso Rodriguez's parents are very kind people. Narciso Rodriguez creates a very happy, calm, and kind mood in his memoir."

""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrafise."" This shows that even though he @MONTH1 not be very wealthy he is grateful that his parents were brave enough to come to @LOCATION1 and try to get their children a better life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he doesn't care as much what his house looks like but he does care how much his parents cared and worked to get where they are."

Narciso was raised in @LOCATION1, and knew why his parents had moved from Cuba, despite their love for the culture and weather. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" This quote shows Narciso's understanding of how much his parents gave up for him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" This shows how happy and thankful he has been throughout his life because he was given the chance to grow up in @LOCATION1. ""I've often told them of my admireation for their strength and perseverance."" Narciso's parents gave up alot to give him a better life, and he shows he will always be greatful for what they have done."

It is a mood of well-being and happiness in their family. I think the author has a verry good bond with his family. I think that because he talks about being with his family alot listening to Cuban Music and eating dinner together. He also appreciates his parents alot because they left cuba to come to the United States so he would have a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be greatful to my parents love and sacrifice""."
"LATE IN THE EVENING   WRITER PAUL SIMON   The first thing I remember I was lying in my bed I couldn't of been no more Than one or two I remember there's a radio Comin' from the room next door And my mother laughed The way some ladies do When it's late in the evening And the music's seeping through The next thing I remember I am walking down the street I'm feeling all right I'm with my boys I'm with my troops, yeah And down along the avenue Some guys were shooting pool And I heard the sound Of a cappella groups, yeah Singing late in the evening And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah Then I learned to play some lead guitar I was underage in this funky bar And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J"" And when I came back to the room Everybody just seemed to move And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play And it was late in the evening And I blew that room away The first thing I remember When you came into my life I said I'm gonna get that girl No matter what I do Well I guess I'd been in love before And once or twice I been on the floor But I never loved no one The way that I loved you And it was late in the evening And all the music seeping through.A blue heron honked overhead..There out in the streets like that..If you're gonna fly away   don't fly without me   don't go no where   I need you, babe      Has the sun gone down on you?.Crede-ma ca luna de pe cer va fi numai, numai a ta   Si crede-ma, in lumea toata doar eu iti voi da toata viata mea   Crede-ma, soarele pe cer va luci numai, numai pentru tine   Si crede-ma, vreau sa crezi in mine!.By the banks   Of your dilemma   Out of control   No one seems   To give the answers   That you wanna hear   What you'd give   To find a welcome here      Miles and miles of lies   Behind you   Those were the days   So many lives   You'd hope would guide you   Help you find a way   Now it seems to your surprise   That they left you lying here   What you'd give to dry   These bitter tears      Did it come naturally?.I've stopped the cries   But now they know my name      The sea is calling me   My spirit must return   As I get closer,   Was it really worth   What I have learned?.Are you for real?.The mood created by the author is a warm and meaningfull adviroment. They made there house have a Cuban feel to it. They have passionate Cuban music playing, and aromas from the kitchen. Anyone who needs to stay at a place, stays there. His parents moved here and left everything  behind them, friends, family, and jobs. His mom and dad taught him that family and friends are the most important thing in your life. He said he learned the real meaning of family in his house and he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."

In the artical Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1 edwards the mood created by the author the mood is happy and sad in different ways because he goes from like be nothing to living in a nice home and a good family and how his first birthday was and what his parents did to make him live a happy life in america."

The @CAPS1 shares her background life with us. She expresses to us how she feels about her Passionate Cuban music, and her parents great cooking skills. ""A love of cooking that is still with me to."" ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day filled the air."" This shows that atl this time the @CAPS1 is grateful about her cooking and music. The @CAPS1 shows her self as a really grateful for all her parents have done for him. ""I thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age"". The @CAPS1 mood is so warming when she expresses her love for the parents, music, and cooking skills. The @CAPS1 creates many moods throught the memoir, but I think mostly she thankful for her family and heritage."

"Can you hear me?.The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you   The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,   This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long   It'd all be as good as gone, without you..She's comin'!.Well I don't eat a lot..(sick and tired)   They're leaving here..Now I believe.Part of me won't go away   Everyday reminded how much I hate it   Weighted against the consequences   Can't live without it, so it's senseless   Wanna cut it out of my soul   And just live with a gaping hole   Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste   I made the problems in the first place   Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me   You hardly see it right next to the heart of me   Heard of me, the routine scar   New cuts cover where the old ones are   And now I'm sick of this   I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity   I rather not even be then the man   That's staring in the mirror through me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way   I feel it swell up inside   Swell up inside, swallowing me   Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it   Once it's been dealt with you feel like   You've been touched by something angelic   And then melted down into a pool of peace   Cease to be the animal you used to be   Remove the broken parts you know were wrong   And feel the calm when the problem's all gone   And then you start to see another piece   Of yourself that you can't let be   Memories of the last fight to free yourself   Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well   And now you know that you can choose   To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise   You can live if you're willing to   Put a stop to just what's killing you   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way   I feel it swell up inside   Swell up inside, swallowing me   Alive in me, inside of me   A part of me screams away silently   Alive in me, inside of me   A part of me screams away silently   This part of me won't go away   Part of me won't go away   Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be   Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me   Everywhere I look around I see how everyone ought to be   Every time I see myself I see there's always something wrong with me   I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way   I feel it swell up inside   Swell up inside, swallowing me   I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way   I feel it swell up inside   Swell up inside, swallowing me   I feel it swell up inside   Swell up inside, swallowing me   I feel it swell up inside   Swell up inside, swallowing me.I was there at the birth,   Out of the cloudburst,   The head of the tempest..The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and good thoughts. Narciso tells us what it was like growing up. She gives us the idea that her and family were really close. She expresses to us how proud she is to be Cuban in many ways. Narciso tells us she enjoys cooking and so do her parents. She loves listening to Cuban music also. Narciso lived in a traditional Cuban home. Her home was not just a simple home, her parents created it into something more meaningful, something more special."

The mood perseverence is expressed in the memoir in many ways. One way it is a stress is when @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 moved to the United States and lived in a one bedroom apartment. They finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood the family raise as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from, water, shelter, and clothing. The reason they move from Cuba was to begin a better life in the United States which they never gave up until the day that they finally had enough money to live here."
"Say goodbye to love   Must have been insane   What was I thinking of?.I'm the boy with the monotone..It's a curse   Don't cry about it, don't cry about it   This is what makes us girls   We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first   Don't cry about him, don't cry about him   It's all gonna happen      The prettiest crowd that you had ever seen   Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean   A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens   And you know something?.Memories that last the years   Call me sentimental.In a matter of a moment   Lost till the end of time   It's the evening of another day   And the end of mine      Now the starlight which has found me   Lost for a million years   Tries to linger as it fills my eyes   'Till it disappears      Could it be that somebody else is   Looking into my mind      Some other place   Somewhere   Some other time      Some other place   Somewhere   Some other time      Like a mirror held before me   Large as the sky is wide   And the image is reflected   Back to the other side      Could it be that somebody else is   Looking into my mind      Some other place   Somewhere   Some other time      Some other place   Somewhere   Some other time.There is no understanding in this hostile age   Sometimes I feel just like a rat locked in a cage   It's hard to live beyond the walls   It ain't no life at all   But don't you tear it down      [Chorus]   Take your chances, I'll take mine   Chasing thunder is only wasted time   Got no reason to walk that line   Heaven's waiting if I can make it home tonight      And with the years I've found a faith that gets me by   It shows me the truth in a hurricane of lies   My baby's left a light for me   That's really all I need   They won't bring me down      [Chorus]      Aimlessly rushing leaves you with nothing   You need some loving to make you feel alive   In less than a moment, life can be stolen   I know where I'm going, gotta get me there tonight      I'm holding on to what I can   Like any other lucky man   Love won't strike me, love won't sell me out      [Chorus].Put on the red shoes that you've never worn before..It's six o'clock on the dot and I'm half way home   I feel foul mouthed as I stand and wait for the underground   And a nervous disposition doesn't agree with this   I need something to remind me that there's something else      You need a holiday, somewhere in the sun   With all the people who are waiting, there never seems to be one   Say something, say something else   Say something, say something else      Advertisements are here for rapid persuasion   If you stare too long you lose your appetite   A nervous disposition doesn't agree with this   You need fast relief from aches and stomach pains      I need a holiday, somewhere in the sun   With all the people who are waiting, there never seems to be one   Say something, say something else   Say something, say something else      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,   12, 13, 14, 15, 16      (You can have it on the rates   Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a one week only special offer.).In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is said in all different ways. In paragraph @NUM1 when she talks about her love for cooking the mood is calm with a dash of spice to it. Since she is Cuban I like to think the cooking is spicy. In paragraph @NUM2 she states, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family..."" That is a happy loving mood. To be able to say that means you have some pretty amazing neighbors. In paragraph @NUM3, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is the most important mood set in this memoir because she is thanking her parents for her life that she has. That is a very respectful thing to do. Everyone does it, but did you write a memoir about it?"

The @PERSON1 family was so happy to be in @LOCATION1 and be free, and no longer in Cuba. It was a very loved environment with friends and family always coming to their table. They were a very caring family. They always had the arms and door wide open to other refugees until They got back on their feet. They were a happy, loving, and caring @CAPS1 family."
"Images of broken light which dance before me   Like a million eyes,   They call me on and on across the universe,   Thoughts meander like a restless wind   Inside a letterbox   They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe      Jai guru deva om   Nothing's gonna change my world   Nothing's gonna change my world   Nothing's gonna change my world   Nothing's gonna change my world..you sure look that way to me      Are you old enough?.Don't go makin' phony calls   Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to   You went through the New York City phone book and prank called 'em all   Hope that you grow out of this fast   Dont' go makin' phony calls,   Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to   Betcha think it's funny when you're drivin' folks right up the wall   But you're just a pain in the aaa.....Alone with my thoughts this evening   I walked on the banks of Tyne   I wondered how I could win you   Or if I could make you mine   Or if I could make you mine   The wind it was so insistent   With tales of a stormy south   But when I spied two birds in a sycamore tree   There came a dryness in my mouth   Came a dryness in my mouth   For then without rhyme or reason   The two birds did rise up to fly   And where the two birds were flying   I swear I saw you and I   I swear I saw you and I   I walked out this morning   It was like a veil had been removed from before my eyes   For the first time I saw the work of heaven   In the line where the hills had been married to the sky   And all around me every blade of singing grass   Was calling out your name and that our love would always last   And inside every turning leaf   Is the pattern of an older tree   The shape of our future   The shape of all our history   And out of the confusion   Where the river meets the sea   Came things I'd never seen   Things I'd never seen   I was brought to my senses   I was blind but now that I can see   Every signpost in nature   Said you belong to me   I know it's true   It's written in a sky as blue   As blue as your eyes, as blue as your eyes   If nature's red in tooth and claw   Like winter's freeze and summer's thaw   The wounds she gave me   Were the wounds that would heal me   And we'd be like the moon and sun   And when our courtly dance had run   Its course across the sky   Then together we would lie   And out of the confusion   Where the river meets the sea   Something new would arrive   Something better would arrive   I was brought to my senses   I was blind but now that I can see   Every signpost in nature   Said you belong to me.Her daddy gave her magic,   I can tell by the way she walks..But I wish that you would hurry,   I hope you get here soon   'cause I just sold the sky to the sun   So I could buy for you the moon..It's falling, it's falling   And outside the buildings   Are tumbling down   And inside a child on the ground   Says he'd do it again      And what am I to do   What in the world am I to say   There's nothing else to do   He says he'll change the world someday   I rejoice      This morning I fell out of bed   When I woke up to what he has said   Everything's crazy   But I'm too lazy to lie      And what am I to do   Just tell me what am I supposed to say   I can't change the world   But I can change the world in me   If I rejoice   Rejoice...

One mood is happiness. This reading feels happy from the beginning to hand because it shows how Narciso went through his life, and what he loves about his childhood paragraph @NUM1 says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences show he loved the environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which made him happy.Narciso also created a mysterious mood. This mood made you think about your home, and what the word 'family' really means. Narciso's family was a great, big, loving group of people-many of whom were not even related. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows thier consideration of family was large, and inspiring.The main mood in this memoir from Narciso is gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did. He is mostly grateful to his parents, as paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice."" Narciso's main mood is gratefullness because he is grateful toward everyone & everything that made his life good, and made him what he is now."
"Well the silence broke my heart, but yes   I spread my legs apart..I love ya and I need you, by my side..Oh yeah..I secretly dream   Of things we will be taught   Will someone esteem   For those who have fought?.This is when the feeling sinks in,   I don't wanna miss you like this,   Come back, be here, come back, be here..I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama..Shout!.Turn on your receiver, I'm gonna lay it on the line   'Cause I'm a great believer, in hangin' on to what is mine   So come over here and listen, I don't want you to be missin'   What I say   And I ain't gonna waste my time sayin' it all again      I've been hearin' stories, 'fact the word's all over town   I've had my share of worries ever since you've been around   So come over hear and listen, I don't want you to be missin'   What I say   And I ain't gonna waste my time sayin' it all again      Turn on your receiver, there's a message comin' through   Keep your hands off my woman   Keep your hands to yourself   Keep your hands off my woman.The mood the the author created for the memoir was ""about how because his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 he lived a life that he would have never have lived before I his life his parents would take people in for a shot peirod of time to help them get back on their feet because they knew that the would do the same for them."
"Is that   Is that really you?.We let the weirdness in."".All I gotta do, is open my eyes and see you - my mystery woman..When I'm walking beside her   People tell me I'm lucky..It was just a small crowd of people around..'Cause the love that we share,   It stays on my mind,   You're always gonna be a little secret of mine..You stole her love from me one day   You didn't care, oh, it hurt me   But you can never steal away memories of what used to be..At this run down place they call the love shack..The author creates a warm, joyful mood in the memoir. He talks about the fond childhood memories he has in a way that gives the reader a warm, joyful feeling inside. For example, although his parents endured hardships in coming to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, they created an inviting home environment. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". (Â¶ @NUM1) This imagery creates a feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't nessecarily based on blood. The author's community was like a family. ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community."" (Â¶ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (Â¶ @NUM3) @CAPS1, the author talks of ""the warmth of the kitchen"", (Â¶ @NUM4) and how the air was always filled with love. All of these passages give the reader a mental picture of joyful and warm family gatherings, instilling those feelings. This is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood. Although his parent's life was tough, they made his life full of joy and warmth, showing that one can make tough experiences into positive situations."

He creates this mood by describing the atmosphere of his home. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The setting of their warm, welcoming home contribute greatly to the mood of the memoir. The author's greatfulness to his parents selflessness and courage also contributes. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" His greatfulness creates a thankful mood through paragraph six and seven, ""it was here were I learned the true definition of ""family"""". This quote helps bring out the love in the mood. The warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the authors point get across in a meaningful way."
"Where I lead me I will travel   Where I need me I will call me   I'm no fool, I'll be ready   God knows I will be   And in the meantime make a little money   And buy a little mercy      Met this morning, now he loves me   Say's he loves me   It must be easy, look around you   All around you   But you see the motion, you're not movin'   You don't know how to hold on   Just keep it loose   Don't get excited, it'll pass before long      Now one is goin' one is stayin'   One is silent one is saying'   Here's your coat, take care of yourself   Sorry you're leavin'   A little sad you're all I had   Will you be returnin'      The boys upstairs are gettin' hungry   You can shout in the wind about how it will be   Or you can clench your fist, shake your head   And head to the country   I got no doubt about it my friend   That's where they'll find me   That's where they're gonna find me      Ask the boys down in the gutter   Now they won't lie cause you don't matter   The street's just fine if you're good and blind   But it ain't where you belong   Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money   And carry yourself home   Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money   And carry yourself home.All my life is on me now, hail the pages turning   And the future's on the bound,   Hell don't know my fury   You're all I need, you're all I need   You're all I need-and maybe some faith would   Do me good      I don't know what I'm doing, don't know should I   Change my mind, I can't decide, there's too many   Variations to consider   No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me   More to do,   It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself,   I make it bitter   Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time   Tell me you belong to me   Baby say that it's all gonna be alright   I believe that it isn't.And if we started all over today,   I think we know that we'd end up in the same place..And so today, your truth has come,   You're gonna pay for what you,   Pay for what you've done,   You'll get what's yours,   You're out of time,   And you will give me back what's mine   Give me, give me back what's mine!.You, you've always stood so tall   I've never thought you'd fall,      But now it's you that's fading!.It's a very special story, that only special   Children will understand..He'll give you breather holes,   And you'll think you're happy..And then I heard a piercing scream   And I rushed to the scene of the crime   But all I found was the butchered remains   Of two girls lay side by side..The mood and Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was love and respect. Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family does not only include blood-relatives. Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piles up, and it is clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents."
"Chorus:   Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like?.Didn't you?.I was a fool to let you break me down,   You think by now that I would know,   Just what to expect from you, oh..Something's been sent here,   To free you, I am told..In a mountain greenery,   Where God paints the scenery   Just two crazy people together..We've been around, we fall, we fly..Why don't you dirt strangers go back to Missouri Where you belong?.Hey hey,the clouds are whey,   There's straw for the donkeys   And the innocents can all sleep safely   All sleep safely..The mood described by the auther was warm and full of happiness. In the memoir, the auther @ORGANIZATION1 talks about the importance of his family Which always brings a comforting feeling. He Shared that he ""was born into a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New jersey"" but that it did not matter where he lived but who he lived with. The mood you get when you read this memoir is mixed because Of the way he describes his parents life, his life and his home. When he says ""the innocence of Childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" he is talking about how close they all are and that, that is what matters, when you read that you feel the comfort, happiness, joy and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parent and everyone around him."

In the article the author is trying to say how good his past was. The mood of the article is that it was happy memories and the smell of his mom's cooking and the memories. As a child the author's memories were happy and home setting mostly the mood was good throughout the story. Throughout the article his memories of his childhood home were happy and good."

They let people live at there house. When the didnt have much money, the took any job the could get so they could care there son, Narciso, they had a three bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country, they also had there house full of love and life. Also they came to this country with not knowing how to speak this language. So the mood of this story at the author seems to be proud."

For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful. That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are."
"Every, every, every, every time she starts to lovin', she bring eyesight to the blind..Elementary penguin singing Hari Krishna..Faithless love like a river flows   Raindrops falling on a broken rose   Down in some valley where nobody goes   And the night blows in like the cold dark wind   Faithless love like a river flows      Faithless love where did I go wrong   Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song   Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong   Faithless love will find you   And the misery entwine you   Faithless love where did I go wrong      Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams   That's the way it sometimes goes   Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems   It's the feeling comes and goes      Faithless love like a river flows   Like raindrops falling on a broken rose   Down in some valley where nobody goes   Faithless love has found me   Thrown its chilly arms around me   Faithless love like a river flows.A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone   A silent prayer to God to help you on your way   I've been depressed so long   It's hard to remember when I was happy   I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more   But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way   the hardest part is to get on with your life      You're searching in the dark   clutching at straws to find a way   You take the Tarot cards and throw them to the wind      Your questions your beliefs,   your inner thoughts, your whole existence   And if there is a God then answer if you will   And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place   Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace      If you could live your life again   Would you change a thing or leave all the same   If you had the chance again   Would you change a thing at all   When you look back at your past   Can you say that you are proud of what we've done   Are there times when you believe   That the right you thought was wrong      All of my life I have believed   Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me.It's been declared   That it's not wise   To prize something too much   I just wish to find something to   Flaunt the right to   Touch so gently      Doesn't nothing ever last forever?.All he ever gives us is pain   Well who's that shouting?.Ya got to do unto others   Like you'd have them, like you'd have them, do unto you..Mark: Simmons!.The mood in this memoir is happyness, love, and warmth. It is to be thankful for what you have and not what you want to have. Narciso was just happy to have such a loving family. Inside of Narciso's home it is very happy loving and warm. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family. Overall the mood created by the author in the story is love."
"I think it's gonna be a lovely day...

I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 shows @CAPS1 for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, culture, and etc. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez."
"It's a new day, I'm not afraid anymore, this is it!.I want her pure as power, I want her skin slightly musty with petticoats   Will you wash the easy bidet out of her head?.There's two blue singin' stars in heaven   I see and hear them every night   They used to sing and shine here on earth   So beautiful and bright   One is a true blue yodeler, he yodeled his way to fame   The other blue star is from Alabama   Oh I need not call his name   They seem to be so happy in their heavenly home   They're singin' with the angels around God's golden throne   So when our life on earth is over   And we turn it to the stars   We'll meet our friends that sing and play   Those golden blue guitars      There's two blue singin' stars in heaven   I see and hear them every night   Singin' songs coming from their hearts   To fill mine with delight   One is a true blue yodeler, he yodeled his way to fame   The other blue star is from Alabama   I need not call his name   They seem to be so happy in their heavenly home   They're singin' with the angels around God's golden throne   Someday there'll be a grand reunion   It'll be a heavenly affair   When we pass through those pearly gates   And meet our friends up ther.I saw an old lover today on the street   She said, ""Do you remember how we used to be   On fire with that passion, we'd burn down those nights?"".And the moon is down   The natives are so restless tonight..Having fun is bad for you!.Whoa   A shadow in the night   Whoa   It wasn't meant to be   I can't take this alone   Don't leave me on my own tonight   Oh no I can't take it alone   Don't leave me on my own tonight   Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass   I wonder if tonight will be my last   I need an angel who will rescue me   To save me from my mental symphony   I can hear 'em,   I can hear 'em,   Someone wake me when it's over   I can see 'em,   I can see 'em   I can see 'em   Over and over again   Whoa   Who turned off the lights?.I was down, nowhere bound   Needed love, any love   Something new, breezy and bashful but true   Changing my whole point of view   Suddenly someone, a midnight romancer   A Romeo dancer in blue   But only with you   Only with you      No more rain, no more chains   No more cold lonely sleepless nights   Laughing eyes, wider than midsummer skies   Crazy but don't ask me why   Suddenly someone, a midnight romancer   A Romeo dancer in blue   But only with you   Only with you      Once a Lone Star rider who danced in super cool   Now a Romeo, it's true   But only with you   Only with you. The mood created by the author in the memoir. The character Narciso's parent moved from cuba to the united states to have better oppertunitys in life. When @PERSON1 came to america he had became friends with a girl name  Alegria."
"You say we're fantastic,   But still we don't head the bill..I'm bringin' sexy back   Them other boys don't know how to act   I think it's special, what's behind your back   So turn around and I'll pick up the slack      Dirty babe   You see these shackles, baby   I'm your slave   I'll let you whip me if I misbehave   It's just that no one makes me feel this way      [Chorus]   Come here, girl (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Come to the back (Go 'head, be gone with it)   VIP (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Drinks on me (Go 'head, be gone with it)   You see what you're twerking with (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Look at those hips (Go 'head, be gone with it)   You make me smile (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Go 'head, child (Go 'head, be gone with it)   And get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)   Get your sexy on      I'm bringin' sexy back   Them other fuckers don't know how to act   Girl, let me make up for all the things you lack   Because you're burning up, I got to get it fast   (Take it to the bridge)      Dirty babe   You see these shackles, baby   I'm your slave   I'll let you whip me if I misbehave   It's just that no one makes me feel this way      [Chorus]      (You ready?.Next time I'mma flip the script, you know, kick some shit that's gon shock her   ""You so tall what team do u play for?"".And lot of useless toys      I can't go on this way   Knowing you don't want me..All's fair in love and war..It may reach out to the sky,   Light up everything that you know..Wouldn't you like to know people people ?.You shoot me down in flames   You put me down a lot   But I'm giving you my heart   Go on take it   Please be careful not to break it   Just remember it's the only one I've got   It's the only one I've      Don't break my heart   Don't break my heart   Don't break my heart      You make me laugh a lot   And buy me silly things   And I'd rather be with you than anyone else   But if you make me mad, but if you make me mad   you'll wish that you had not   You'll wish that you had not      Don't break my heart   Don't break my heart   Don't break my heart      Where are the roses and whispered sighs   Where are the compliments and dreaming eyes   It doesn't matter you see   I know you love me   And real basic love never dies      Don't break my heart   Don't break my heart   Don't break my heart      Where are the roses and whispered sighs   Where are the compliments and dreaming eyes   It doesn't matter you see   I know you love me   And real basic love never dies      Don't break my heart   Don't break my heart   Don't break my heart.In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven."
"Don't you want me, oh?.You're movin' movin' just a little too fast,   I've got my foot down clear to the floor..God, hit me straight on..S que j'ai franchi la fronti?.Embrace, embrace..Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,   Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere,   Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care, a go-go girl in love..Fuckin' come and break the door down..Five gears in reverse   For girls looking at the big lift   Somebody send out for the night nurse   Please don't stick me on the late shift   If you don't know by now   Nobodys gonna tell you   If you don't know by now   The shock will probably kill you      But if your patience is corrupted and you still cannot decide   Youre sitting in the garage contemplating suicide   And you have no motivation you can't even catch your breath   All of this acceleration is driving you to death      Five gears in reverse   You think I don't know what I'm doing   Another fashionable first   Like walking down the road to ruin   But if you're safe and sound   Don't let me interrupt you   And if you're gagged and bound   Well how can I corrupt you      Chorus. The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and @CAPS1. I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are surten parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1 and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir."
"Tell her where you've gone and been..This could be just another highway, coiled up in the night..I'll   Fill your world with joy and all your wrong I will erase..Can we do it again sometime I'd like that   Fantastic see'est la vie mesdames et messieurs   And at the peak of the season   The Mediterranean   This time of year it's so fashionable      I feel like dancing in the rain   Can I have a volunteer?.You gotta run, run, run away..Well, there's only one here that I think that I know,   That tall fellow standing alongside the stove..And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes   Someone should send you a rose   With love from a friend,   It's nice to hear from you again   And the storybook comes to a close   Gone are the ribbons and bows   Things to remember, places to go   Pretty maids all in a row      Ooo ooo ooo   Ooo ooo ooo   Ooo ooo ooo   Ooo ooo ooo      Ooo ooo ooo   Ooo ooo ooo   Ooo ooo ooo   Ooo ooo ooo.Be so happy with the way you are   Be so happy that you made it this far   Go on be happy now..The mood of this memoir is the importance of family. @ORGANIZATION1 says in the beginning how much he loves his cuban culture and heritage. For example, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Narciso Rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much. Him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us.""  Narciso also became close to other immigrants that were not blood-related to him. ""Growing up in this envirement instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighberhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" Narciso was close to many people who he considered family."
"Oh, why is everything so confusing?.Don't wanna be away, babe   Away from my heart   I want you back      You say I wanna be ok, hey!.I may not live to see a brand new day      Oh baby, don't let, the green grass fool you   Don't let it change your mind   You know why, it may be greener on the other side, baby   But right in my arms is where you belong, ooh baby      Don't let the green grass fool you   Don't let it change your mind, oh baby   It may be greener on the other side, baby   But right in my arms is where you belong, baby      Don't let the green grass fool you   Don't let it change your mind   It may be greener on the other side, baby   In my arms is where you belong, yeah.dont believe her..I've been waiting for,   You to come rescue me,   I need you to hold,   All of the sadness I can not,   Living inside of me..All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care..Young Pegi just died today   Young Pegi just died today   And I guess   Nobody even knows the case   But the way the story goes   She just ran out of clothes   No will this world   Just for the peg down   Last words, can't talk   And then she wrote..My watch has stopped now more turning hands   Little green neon hands..The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and comforting. The author described his home with great words and descriptions. While describing the meals and get togethers, the author made me feel at home. Memories are sometimes greater than plans of the future. Memories of homes are the best in remembering times at home. This memoir made me think of past times and happy memories. The vocabulary and extra information in this memoir made the mood of it very happy and comforting and made me want to read more about his past life."
"Don't you know that you're nothing more than a one night stand..What about the night we cried,   Because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside?.You're so fresh and you're so new,   I do enjoy you, Miss..And he'll tell her, he's working late again   But she knows to well there's something goin' on..What have I done?.Long time passing   Where have all the flowers gone?.God forgive the things that we do..Now there's nothing left but emptiness..The @CAPS1 Created in the @CAPS2 is Not that of a @CAPS3 one. The @CAPS1 Created is cheerful and happy, as the narrator talks about his family and childhood. @CAPS4 talks about how his Neighborhood consisted of many races. as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" @CAPS4 talks about how they all live together in peace and @ORGANIZATION1. This @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that the meaning of family does not nesecarily mean you have to be related. The @CAPS1 is happy and @CAPS6 that friends are family too. "

In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 his parents did a ton for Rodriguez and he is constantly grateful. Their is also a lot of love in the mood of the book because there are lots of mentions of family. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family."" @CAPS2 arms opened and a big ""family"" are surely signs of lots of love. The mood of the excerpt is also cheerful because as Rodriguez says ""Passionate salsa music filled the air."" And ""a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air."" Music and feasting are two of the most cheerful things there are.By recalling experiences from his childhood @PERSON2 manages to make the mood of his memoir loving, grateful, and cheerful all at the same time."

"Goodnight Dear Jesus,   Goodnight, goodnight ..I don't want to open my eyes cause if   I do I may not leave you   I don't want to open my eyes cause if   I do I may not leave you.I been hangin' round this place, I been lookin' through your space   I been waitin' for you, I've been waitin' for you   All the places that you go, all the people that you know   I've been lookin' for you, I've been lookin' for you      And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place   They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face   They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard   Singin' hallelujah while they dance over the stars   They all say they're goin' far      Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby   I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby   All night long, all night long, all night long      Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land   So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand   Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along   While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song,   Were you even here at all?.I'm overheated, about to catch fire-hah!.Pointing finger Havana way,   These three words which transpire:      She told me that only in Miami   Is Cuba so far away..I know!.There ain't no entertainment   And the judgments are severe..you haven't heard a word of what i said i'd give anything to get inside your head you act as if there's nothing left to say i guess everything is easier that way i know that you don't want to think about it anyway i won't let you hide from this even with your best defense you can't deny the way you feel about me i know you think about it all of time but there's nothing left to make you change your mind i know you think you're doing what is right but you're acting on frustration out of spite and i don't want to say another word to start a fight and if you're so convinced that we're so wrong you're still standing here where you've been all along it doesn't make much difference where we think that we belong. The mood by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is happy. When the author talk about his or her memoirs it seemed like they felt happy having those memoirs to talk about. Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is."
"Please don'tcha do it to me baby,   Either take the love I offer   Or let me be..Oh Lord, so many souls to be won,   Oh Lord, this world is falling apart,   Crying for love from a broken heart..Baby, I'd even would be climbing up your tree..This is a story full of restless nights   Of do or do not 'cause there is no try   Across a decade we flew high and we fell low   And getting up when we're dragged down is all we've known      We were born to be the ones   To show the faithless what we've done   And there's a fire inside   We were born to be the ones   To show the faithless what we've done   And there's a fire inside   It burns like the surface of the sun      Here in this Angel City lights will shine   (Lights will shine)   And for a while we let ourselves go blind   But now we know who loves and loves us not   And they're worth every good thing we have lost      (Ooh!).I do not know why I would go   In front of you and hide my soul   'Cause you're the only one who knows it,   Yeah you're the only one who knows it      And I will hide behind my pride   Don't know why I think I can lie   'Cause there's a screen on my chest   Yeah there's a screen on my chest      [Chorus: x2]   I'm standing in front of you   I'm standing in front of you   I'm trying to be so cool   Everything together trying to be so cool      I can't see past my own nose, I'm seeing everything in slo-mo   Look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive   That's a train, am I painting the picture that's in my brain?.Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air   Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air      You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy   Yeah, you take me to utopia   You're reading me like erotica,   Boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah      Just when I think I can't take anymore   We go deeper and harder than ever before   We go higher and higher   I feel like I'm already there      I'm walking on air (tonight)   I'm walking on air   I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)   I'm walking on air   I'm walking on air (tonight)   I'm walking on air   I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)   I'm walking on air   I'm walking on air      This is pure paradise,   Even heaven is jealous of our love   Yes, we make angels cry,   Raining down on earth from up above      Just when I think I can't take anymore   We go deeper and harder than ever before   We go higher and higher   I feel like I'm already there      I'm walking on air (tonight)   I'm walking on air   I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)   I'm walking on air   I'm walking on air (tonight)   I'm walking on air   I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight)   I'm walking on air   I'm walking on air      Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air   Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air      Heaven is jealous of our love   Angels are crying from up above      Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air   I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking on air   Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air   Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air   I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking on air   Tonight (tonight), I'm walking on air   I'm walking on air      Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air   I'm walking on air   Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air   I'm walking on air.The map that leads to you,   Following, following, following to you..If I was you, If I was you,   I'd wanna see, I'd wanna see inside my head,   I'd wanna know if I was fuckin dead,   I'd wanna know what's going on,   Someone tell me the truth..The author created many feelings in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that the author's family celebrated life and created upbeat feelings. In conclusion, the author of the memoir created many feelings for the reader."

It was saying how it was a traditional cuban home and there was passionate cuban music that filled the air. There was also the mixing of the aromas in the air coming from the kitchen. There's tons of loving people around the house too. Which makes it home and comfertable. The mood was always happy and everyone loved to cook so they would always do that together even though they wernt blood related. ""Within the walls, my young parents created created our traditional cuban home, every heart of it was in the kitchen. As you can tell this family loves being together and enjoys eachothers company"

For example he likes that his parents are selfish and hard working people and tried to make his life happy. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. He also likes how they tought him things that they know how to do such as cooking. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit eser then how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried. His mood changed to be happy again when he menchened that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home."

Like an.The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir."

First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion. Rodriguez describes, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM2). Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere. The author says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir a passionate mood is displayed. "

His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it. Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped Immigrants who needed support."

He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."

"O sacred head now wounded   With grief and shame way down,   Now scornfully surrounded   With thorns thine only crown,      How art thou pale with anguish,   With sore abuse and scorn..Back in '95 when this was new   I guess I didn't have a clue   I thought the world would change with the right song   So we picked it up and moved it out   And turned the whole thing upside down   I told myself it wouldn't be too long   And I believed in everyone   And everything they told me   And I believed that anything   Anything was possible      Shoot the moon   Shoot the moon   Shoot the moon      Hit or miss it makes no difference   Back when everything was looking up   I thought I'd never get enough   I didn't let the world obstruct my view   And we thought that it would never end   We had our fun in spite of it   And paved the way for something slightly new.Over here, to the rear with your girl and the   40s of beer      Where you At Rock?.You should have said   I don't want to love..This is how I feel....Tell me what am I fighting for?.I've got a telegraph (I've got a telegraph) in my hand (In my hand)   Words on paper (Words on paper), written in sand (Written in sand)   We've got telegraph (We've got telegraph), right across this land (All across this land)   It doesn't mean a damn thing (It doesn't mean a damn thing)   We don't understand (Now we understand) (Telegraph)   God's got a telegraph on his side (On his side) (Telegraph)   It makes him powerful, gives him pride (Gives him pride)   Even in America, god bless America   They understand (They understand) the value of the telegraph (The value of the telegraph)   Hand in hand, hand in hand...

""My young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen... My parents passed on to me... a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air..."" @CAPS1 continues by describing how wonderful a place to grow up it was + how his parents showed him genorosity.Next, @CAPS1 says how hard it was for his parents to leave everything they knew, just for their children. In states in paragraph @NUM2, ""they came selflessly... to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 continues by writing of how strong they were by showing him the value of family + friends + genorosity. This shows how apprecitive @CAPS1 was of them. Overall, by communicating this mood, @CAPS1 was able to honor his parents that much more."
"hot assed inkwell Lord   But I can't leave you with the blues no   No no.You were lonely and you needed a friend   And he was there at the right time with the right smile   Just a shoulder to lean on   Someone to tell you it'll all work out alright      Don't let him steal your heart away   No, don't let him steal your heart away   Don't let him steal your heart away   No, don't let him steal your heart away      You can look at him the way you did me   And hold him close say you're never letting go   But any fool can see you're fooling yourself   But you ain't fooling me      So don't let him steal your heart away   No, don't let him steal your heart away      And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back   And don't take my pictures off a' the wall   Oh, did you hear me?.I been waiting   Waiting under things that rise in the morning      I been holding   Holding back so long      You can own it   Take it off my hands, do me a favor      Nothin' wasted   Just finger fucked and busted up all at once      I'm so lost out on the highway   With no direction left to go   Everyday sit up and wonder   Where it was I started from      The more you've found, the less you've been around..It's only fair..The cats and dogs and all the heard,   Allelujah!.We'll find a new way of living,   We'll find a way of forgiving   Somewhere      There's a place for us,   A time and place for us..Just say what you want to say?.I've played the game , still it's not worth it   Like a woman in the rain   I close my eyes   I'm on the shelf   I know myself      I've seen the lights of every city   Tried to work out where I am   I close my mind for the day   I know the way      I've played the game , still it's not worth it   Like a woman in the rain   So I close my eyes   I'm on the shelf   I know my self      There's never ever anybody to rely on   There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on   That's just circumstances , I must take my chances   But, baby you don't know what I'm saying   But I guess that's not true   And you know that's true   But there's a method to my madness      I've played the game , still it's not worth it   Like a woman in the rain   So I close my eyes for the day   I know the way.In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, it patrays the mood of Narciso home and relationship with his parents. The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful and cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home alive with Cuban food and music. Thats stating the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story it was hopefull they left Cuba and only lived in a @NUM1 room apartment but his parents were hopeful they would succeed. It was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home."

Narciso explains that he is grateful for his parents and what they did for him. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their own culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"""
"I've gotta start facing up to what I really am..Terrified of what may come..When you're next to me   I'm exactly where I want to be [Repeat: x 5].But there was never a doubt in mind   How it was meant to be   So who do I turn to darlin' if you should leave?.I'm so tired, so tired,   Sick and tired of it all,   I'm so tired, sick and tired,   I'm so tired, sick and tired of it all, yeah..Oh!.Through time, keeling..MC T on a hit and to make sure I don't miss,   Kick the beat as this fool persists      Step off me, get the hell off, well I'm riding   Flowing with this funky beat, you suckers keep on tryin'a   Diss this, uh-uh, I ain't having it   Sucker duck, understand my schedule work too heavy   I'm a man, I mean, sometimes it seems hammer claim   But I can still cop a lean and explain to you   An MC who's got beef, I'm giving grief to disbelief   You said that I was new to this well put me on your hit list   I'm 'quipped to rule, and I squash all the bull      [Chorus: ]   We got our own ideas!.The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" made me feel like I was in their kitchen eating Cuban food, and listen to music. Also, he told the life of a cuban immigrant. My grandfather followed the same path. He was a young boy when his family immigrated from Cuba. But he worked his hardest and became a very succesful man. This story completely reminds me of him and since I have some background with this, I know this ""mood"" and it speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person. Finally, the mood he created shows that if you put your mind too it you could accomplish anything. Also, it shows the mood created in a typical cuban home."
"Release your love to me..Stone after stone   You build a road to nowhere   Mile after mile   The future isn't going anywhere      I've been waiting such a long time, baby   I've been waiting for the world to      Burn the churches!.This is the life you saved laid out before you   Everything that I think I have been and what I am now   Nothing can change the way I feel about you   Better we go on our separate ways   Nothing is left but the endless days   Nothing to cry but your name      Don't you look back, don't say a word   I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you   Don't you despair   I will be there for you   I will be there      Maybe this time next year we'll be together   You can wipe away all of the tears, bring truth to the lies   There was a silent dream, we made a promise   We'd be there for each other forever   Aboard like a ship on an ocean's roar   Beating a path to your open door   Nothing will keep me away      Don't you look back, don't say a word   I will be lonely for ya, I will be standing for you   Don't you despair   I will be there for you   Each night I pray to God above   You will be waiting for me, you will be lonely for me   Don't you despair   I will be there for you   I will be there      Don't you look back, don't say a word   I will be lonely for ya, I will be standing for you   Don't you despair   I will be there for you   Farewell to you, goodbye for me   I will be waiting for you   I will be lonely for you   Don't you despair   'Cause I will be there for you   I will be there.What a Christmas to remember      Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave   Christmas to remember, too good to believe   Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again   We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind      And you've made this a Christmas to remember   Springtime feelin's in the middle of December   Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender   Oh!.On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder   Till i see the mountains rise..I said, ""Goodnight L.A.""   Cause I'm awake in my room   I been up for thirty eight hours   And it don't look like sleep's coming soon      Cause I could break like a bird   Or I could swallow the sea   It seems like the daylight is coming   And no one is watching but me      But I don't mind the dark discovering the day   Cause the night   Is a beautiful bright blue and grey      And what brings me down now is love   Cause I can never get enough      And it's a dangerous time for a heart on a wire   Shuttled from station to station noisily   Now knowing why      So I put my head on the ground   And the sky is a wheel   Spinning these days into things that I've lost   But you can keep all the years      But I don't mind the days gone rolling away   Cause this sunlight   Feels warm on my face today      And what brings me down now is love   Cause I can never get enough of love.Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down..(with Carole Bayer Sager)      You and me   We've traded hearts   I guess that's how   It always starts out   And then I guess it always ends      Look at us   (Now)   Sayin'   I don't think that you and me   Can just be friends   Maybe this is how the whole thing   Has to just end      And if we could   Have loved enough   (La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah, la...)   We would have handled   When it got rough   But one of us let go too soon      So here we are   (Here we are)   Now sayin'   I don't think that you and me   Can just be friends   Maybe this is how the whole thing   Has to just end      I wish you'd understand....In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON2, the mood is friendly. Anybody was allowed to stay at his house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" His parents were ready to take anyone in because they knew they also would. Their community had a strong bond. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was life in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Getting with family and celebrating was the theme of their home. @CAPS1 loved and cared for each other in the neighborhood."
"One night in the West Virginia mountains I got stranded in the deepening snow   I found important house and took a small room no TV magazines or radio   I've stood and watched the snow fall past the window   And as a traveling man would sometimes do   I've picked up the Bible and looked through it I found the stock of letters tied in blue   The letters had been left there by a young girl there were ten and as I read the first   I found that they were from a boy in Detroit   Who'd sent for her as soon as he got work   The first one mentioned her expected baby   The one and two and three were much the same   The fourth and fifth said that he might send to get her   The sixth and seventh offered her his name   The eighth and ninth were weeks apart in postmark   They were short and asked about her help   The tenth one was a tear stained on the pages   Said that he had married someone else   Next morning I felt guilty when I checked out   As the highway people cleared away the snow   I asked about the girl who used to live there   They said she passed away three weeks ago   Well I kept the letters but I never read them   Oh but somewhere up in Detroit there's a man   Who heard what happened down in West Virginia   And we're the only two who understand.When hot gets a little cold....A!.My steaming coffee warms my face   I'm disappointed in the taste..(Written By Cohen, Performed In ""Night Magic"")      [cf the lyrics to the song ""Anthem"" on the Cohen album ""The Future""]      (Judy) The birds they sang at break of day   Start again, I heard them say   Nor dwell on what has passed away   Or what is yet to be..Oh man   I can't go to work   I got 2 more sick days      This is for my people working   Waking up at six in the morning   Try to make an honest living   Oki oki oki oki oh      Let me see your hands up high   Touch the cloud reach for the sky   Need some time peace of mind   To make money, money, make money, money, money      [Chorus]   Holiday, holiday   Cause I work hard everyday, everyday   Need some time to get away, get away   So tell my boss I need a holiday, holiday   You know you want a holiday, holiday   Cause you work hard everyday, everyday   Tell your boss that you want a raise, want a raise   Let's go make money, money, make money, money, money      Moving you know we keep it moving   My people in the front   You gotta keep it moving   Keep it moving you know we keep it moving   My people in the back   We gotta keep it moving   Keep it moving you know we keep it moving   My people in the rear   You gotta keep it moving   Keep it moving you know we keep it moving   Let's go make money, money, make money, money, money      This is for my people riding   Can't make car no bills keep piling   Wining, dining when the bill comes   Breakout here comes the sound   I'm tired of the same routine   First one, last one on the scene   A pocket little drives so I need the queen   I gotta make money, money, make money, money, money      [Chorus]      Now the house is on fire   And we don't need no water   As long as there's music hit it   As long as there's music   Let it burn, burn, burn, burn      [Chorus].The friends we used to know   Would always smile hello   ""No love like our love"", they'd say   Then love slipped through our fingers   Somewhere along the way   I should forget   But with the loneliness of night   I start remembering   Everything   You're gone and yet   There's still a feeling deep inside   That you will always be   Part of me   So now I look for you   Along the avenue   And as I wander I pray   That someday soon I'll find you   Somewhere along the way   Somewhere along the way.I'll rise up to help them, I'm due, I'm six hundred years old!.The author created a heartfelt mood in the memoir. The mood the author created was greatful mood. In the memoir it states ""skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" This quote make me feel grateful for my culture and heritage. This story also make me feel proud. In the story it states ""My Mother and father had come to this country with such courage"". I feel so proud that they wanted to leave to come have a better life. Lastly the mood is happy. This story is happy because he learns a good lesson and he pround of his parents and culture."
"Fucking around in a crap game   Niggas think I'm soft cause now I'm in the rap game   And I don't hang out as much   Bang out dope cuts   Standing on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts   But when it comes to getting in a circle   I'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple   Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke   When deuce deuce hit the floor yo   Now which of ya want to fade the twenty?.Look into the children's laughter   Tell me what tomorrow brings for those so far away from home..Oooh, I think it could be so good..And I hate you!.(kirsty maccoll)   I thought of you when they closed down the school   And the hospital too   Did they think that you were better?.My sunsets fade..Butterfly lazily drinking the sun,   lavishly sprinkled and painted with gold..Take me by the hand and baby play that game again   Don't you know that you're nothing more than a one night stand?.In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy."

He tells of how he will always be grateful for his Cuban culture that stayed with him his whole life, and for the selflessness of his parents. The mood that he sets in this memoir is gratefulness. When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, @PERSON1's family still found away to have a home. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave @CAPS1 a sense of family even though his real family was very far away. He is grateful for this because he will always have his cuban culture because that's what he was raised with. The overall mood he created was gratefulness."

She wanna break it down   She want some reggaeton      [...]      Mamacita, oh my God I think you're on fire   Do you want me to get you water?.There's no justice in a dream..In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author."
"Have you noticed The way people seem today?.Burn....Hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano!.Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,   It's the same old ending-time to go..Now, I don't believe that Heaven waits   For only those who congregate   I like to think that God is love..You got me You got me      [Chorus:]   Be still and know (we know!).Oh, I want you for the rest of my life      Walking through time   Looking for an answer   How can it be this way?.My folks were always puttin' him down..The mood created by the author overall is gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some events in his life you notice he mostly talks about his family. He says that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, what matters is love.Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacraficed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get.Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family. It saw what courage it took for his parents to turn the simple house they once had into a home for him."
"In the shadows   You get to know your lover mostly by feel   Got to put your faith in things you can touch   If you dare to   'Cause the shadows can make you crazy   With the things they reveal   They show it all without revealing too much   Scare the hell out of you   'Cause me and my love   Live among the shadows   Where the old playground is an alley way   Now me and my love make love among the shadows   When the sun goes down in a dark hallway   Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes   Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow   Me and my baby know love in the shadows   In the shadows   You got to work at love to get it to shine   You can't believe in everything that you see   Not this time around   'Cause the shadows can play   A half a million tricks on your mind   You try your best but you can never break free   It just kind of drags you down   'Cause me and my love   Live among the shadows   Where the old playground is an alley way   Now me and my love make love among the shadows   When the sun goes down in a dark hallway   Love in the shadows where the sun never shines   Deep in the shadows where most men go blind   Me and my baby find love in the shadows.I've been a million places and I've seen a million faces,   But I couldn't stop thinking 'bout you..Everything you want, anything at all, everything you want..Computer age computer age   Computer age..Song For The Mira   Out on the Mira one warm afternoon   Old men go fishing with black line and spoon   And if they catch nothing they never complain   I wish I was with them again   As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore   Teasing the one that they really adore   And into the evening the courting begins   I wish I was with them again   Chorus:   Can you imagine a piece of the universe   More fit for princes and kings?.At this time I would like to introduce a friend of ours,   a very talented guy named John Sebastian..A thorn in my side, thorn in..qui che l'esser mio, che l'esser mio   s'affisa intero..The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir was very positive and warm, showing gratitude, and promoting the real definition of family. An example of his gratitude towards his parents is when he states: ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Narciso describes his sense of true family in paragraph @NUM1 when he says: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso describes that his parents were very courageous coming to @LOCATION1 having no previous knowledge of the culture or language. He expresses how thankful he is for his parents to come to @LOCATION1, leaving everything they knew behind, in order to give him a better life. He describes his neighborhood being a true family, adding big dinners together, and helping one another in times of need ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done... I think them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood of the memoir truly does demonstrate the importance of family, love, warmth, and gratefulness."

In this memoir the author states""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". One reason why this describes the author's mood is that it shows that through all the great times he's had with his family, they have giving him an experience of a life time that he will never forget. Another reason why this shows the author's mood is that now that his parents have died and he misses them the only memory he has of them is this house he calls home. That is how the author describes his mood a lot in this memoir."

It's grateful because the boy kept on talking about how thankfull he is for all the stuff he has. Another reason why the mood is grateful is because all of the people in the neighborhood will all come together and eat with eachother, visit with eachother, and help eachother. I know the mood is grateful because it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""

A..Near to the Heart of God      There is a place of quiet rest,   Near to the heart of God..The tone of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was a happy one with many positive feelings, memories, and undertones mixed in. Rodriguez sets the mood in the @NUM1 paragraph when @CAPS2 describes the warm, inviting, and cozy feeling that was given off at his home. Here @CAPS2 describes how ""passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This gives off a warm, innocent vibe, staging the mood for the memoir @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM2, the mood is expanded so that it also encopasses the welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez says that his ""parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people [they] considered family"". Finally, this excerpt gives off a proud and graceful mood. This pride and gratitude from Narciso Rodriguez is directed toward his parents @CAPS2 uses many words like ""courage"", ""selflessly"", ""struggled"", ""braving"", and ""hardships"" to describe Rawedia and @PERSON2's actions with a proud undertone Rodriguez then talks about how grateful @CAPS2 is to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Then @CAPS2 goes on to talk about how deeply grateful @CAPS2 is towards his parents for all they did for him in great detail. The mood of this memoir is happy, welcoming, warm, grateful, and proud. that would make anyone yearn for the one place where they too felt this feeling circulating around them"

Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. ""I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them What they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done...""p. @NUM1. He closed it off with how he could never forget how his parents turned a house into a home, appreciation flowing strongly"

The mood in the memoir is peaceful and loving The reason why it is peaceful is because there is no fighting in this story at all. This story is loving because throughout the whole thing the only thing that I learned about was how to respect and love each other. There are many examples of this in paragraph @NUM1 and paragraph @NUM2. This is the tone of the story."

While reading this story, I could feel the love, peace, & appreciation created by his words. Throughout the memoir, he really expands on the love & appreciation he feels for his parents. Paragraph @NUM1 states: ""I'll always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" Also, in paragraph @NUM2, he again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home.

"oh, I hope you like it."".[Justin Bieber]   I, I see them coming, coming..Keep it on your head Hollywood is dead..It could've been, would've been, should've been, could've been   It could've been, should've been, could've been, could've been me   It could've been, should've been, would've been, could've been me   Could've been me   (Could've been, would've been, should've been, could've been me)      I see that mountain bear look in his eyes   Watch you follow you back home   Recognize that look in his eye   Wish he'd leave you alone      It could've been me, it could've been me   I know it might been me   I know it could've been me      (Could've been, would've been, should've been me)   (Could've been, would've been, should've been me)   Help me, help me   (Could've been, would've been, should've been me)   Help me, help me   (Could've been, would've been, should've been me)   Help me, help me      See that man waving you goodbye   I see no tear in your eye for him   See that man who's got, who got a well kept suit   ?.Everybody's gotta listen make the decision to envision a better place with no division..Its hard to recognize that's all   True it wasn't that at all.Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)   Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)   It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)   Feel alright,yeah (You feel alright,yeah,sio what are you waiting for?.You think you're clever,   You know you're insane,   You're lies are not white they are black..The mood in this memoir created by the author, was very peaceful and extremely loving. It was also a big thank you to his parents for everything they did for him. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and Sacrifice."" The author is trying to get his point (of gratefulness) across to, not only the reader, but everyone in his life, but it seems that at some point he's lost for words. ""@CAPS1 often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the Spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The way the author explains everything puts you in the same mood is him. He seemed to feel the same peaceful, yet loving, and grateful mood flow over you as well. This is an amazing piece of work."

In paragraph seven it states ""... i celebrated my first birthdays. it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house..."" That shows how much he loved his home, even though it wasn't purfect. Also in paragraph four he say's ""..our landlords and his daughter Alegria-my first friend..."" Narciso's tell's about his first friend.

Also he was grateful to have his family and friends in his apartment. The author was just so proud of his life and parents."
"You're looking in the mirror,   Oh, your scratching off my skin,   You think I didn't notice,   The madness and torture is drawing me in,   The satalite is watching,   And then you come home,   And you switch on your sorrow,   Boil up a bad mood,   Shaking the hand of bad habits again,   Again....I see them dancing somewhere in the moonlight   Somewhere in Alaska, somewhere in the sun   I hear them singing a song for all lovers   A song for the two hearts beating only as one      Imagine the morning no longer alone   The arms of another, a place to belong   No longer the struggle, no longer the night   And ever becoming in the quickening light      To see the darkness, to listen within   To answer in kindness, to ever begin   To ever be gentle, to always be strong   To walk in the wonder, to live in the song      In a place of enchantment where the wild things are known   Will the future remember when the lovers are gone?.I tell you why   I could never hate you   Even when you're far away,   I know you love me in your soul..I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste   A flannel for my face   Pyjamas, a hairbrush   New shoes and a case   I said to my reflection   Let's get out of this place   Past the church and the steeple   The laundry on the hill   Billboards and the buildings   Memories of it still   Keep calling and calling   But forget it all   I know I will   Tempted by the fruit of another   Tempted but the truth is discovered   What's been going on   Now that you have gone   There's no other   Tempted by the fruit of another   Tempted but the truth is discovered   I'm at the car park, the airport   The baggage carousel   The people keep on crowding   I'm wishing I was well   I said it's no occasion   It's no story I could tell   At my bedside empty pocket   A foot without a sock   Your body gets much closer   I fumble for the clock   Alarmed by the seduction   I wish that it would stop   I bought a novel, some perfume   A fortune all for you   But it's not my conscience   That hates to be untrue   I asked of my reflection   Tell me what is there to do.Glory, glory, hallelujah,   Glory, glory, hallelujah,   Glory, glory, hallelujah,   And he ain't gonna jump no more!.[Chorus]   I suit you the way that'chu want..'Cause all I have left is a heart full of mirrors   A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over, girl it's over   I'll hear it echo deep inside..So, don't come around here no more,   Bringing me all of your bad rain..The mood created by the memoir is greatfulness. I think this because this is one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful. (paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2 he also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's memoir states all the things he is grateful for this is why I believe greatfulness is the mood of this passage"

The @CAPS1 states, ""always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love."" The @CAPS1 explains the mood by a Cuban feast. Also when he learns that in the neighborhood there is love to. The @CAPS1 states, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The @CAPS1 shows how many cultures and countrys show satisfaction in the whole neiborhood that is filled with mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1. The @CAPS1 shows a good positive, and geneorus mood in the book that has all started in the kitchen with a Cuban feast."

It also seems @CAPS1 misses it. ""I was born into this simple house"" @CAPS1 says ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 was very comfortable in his home and @CAPS1 loved it. It seems as thogh the excerpt was made to thank those who @CAPS1 lived with. As it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 the excerpt @CAPS1 explains how caring, and generous his family and neighbors were."" My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author tells about his neighbor making delicious meals all the time, and their dinner table consisted of many neighbors, and blood relatives. The author had a very close relationship with his neighbors."

The first example I have for the mood is when he say's ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that ""family"". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit. This reading was a good example of a closs nit comunity and of parent scracise. for they kid's."

Food Glorious food what is there more handsom   gulped, swallowed, or chewed   Still worth a king's randsom   what is it we dream about   What brings on a sigh   piled peaches and cream about   Six feet high!!!.In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative. loving is what they did most because they basicly called everyone thier family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life. A example is ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved"". This shows they care about thier kids. One last mood is appreciative. ""The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start thier life over. These are the moods that was created by the author."
