He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."

I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story."

In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""My parents... Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."". Here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. Rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. This is shown in para @NUM2, in two instances when he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And where it also says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship.""At the end of his memoir, Rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having ""Such courage"" and how ""They came selflessly"" (para, @NUM5) to @LOCATION1. In para @NUM6 it tells, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.To conclude, I truly need to say is that Rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. It spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which I believe is the best gift a parent can give their child."

There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""...

Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."

Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1.

My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created.
