It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and I can relate to that. It gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in. It made me feel strong and inspired my the mother and father's dedication to family.

The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author. The author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there, and go there."

In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family."

I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a home. He appreciates how his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family.So in this memoir the author created a mood that showed greatfulness and appreciation."
 In the memoir the mood created by the author mood the mood of happiness and appritiation. This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family. Also just to have everyone united as one and be thankful for my culture and it kind of makes me want to explore my culture and express it more.
"The shows moods many author while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. "", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside."
 The creates mood a special author in this memoir. The mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood. He talks about his family and how they all ate together and always had relatives stoping by. It gives you a sense of togetherness. It gives you a sense of how the family interacted and became one with the neighborhood. So the author of this article really shows how just the whole town had a sense of togetherness with the family.
 This creates feeling a warm memoir of nostalgia for the auther's home. The author writes about how his parents were able to make a great home out of a @NUM1 room apartment. The auther also wrote about how his parents raised him wild teaching his cuban heratige
"The author was so parrentsful, thank explained how thank parrents there they for moving here. And how a house can become a  home and how important family and friends relationships are"
"In this @DATE1 from ""Home: The creates of Our Lives"",Narciso Rodriguez mood a safe, calm and secure Blueprints. His description of his home and family gives readers a feeling of warmth and happiness. The very last sentence in paragraph @NUM1 says  ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS1 just a backdrop. He also says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close – knit community... ""and "" countless extended family members came and went... my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family..."". The way, Narciso described his family and neighborhood, keeps you a sense of unity and comfort, like there will always be someone there if something goes wrong. In the @DATE1, Narciso creates a mood of gratitude, constantly repeating how thankful he is to his parents. He tries to get the message across that ""[he] will never forget how [they] turned the simple house into a home"" or ""their love and sacrifice."" In my opinion, Narciso Rodriguez created a comforting and grateful mood in his @DATE1."
"The mood created by the author in the memoir mood a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremily grateful."" @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says ""I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him. ""I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly"". That also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful. It also shows how the author is happy about his parents desisions."
 thave @CAPS1 mood was good have details spicecfic he and told were have was from how his parents were ect.
"In the memoir, the creates mood a very peaceful author. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."
"In this memoir the was that security created security mood and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story."

"The has, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", mood a comfortable and loving story. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone says how much love there was in the house. The mood of this story was very comfortable and very, very loving."
"In the memoir the creates mood the author of happiness when he talks about his parents 'love and caring for others. 'The author talks about in paragraph two when he was born. His parents passed on their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking, ""and for which I am eternally grateful."" His parents would play, ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day. )""In paragraph three, the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In his neighborhood, everyone came together and extended a hand to people who were clearly in need.Rodriguez went on to explain how his parents would have everyone over for dinner and help people get back on their feet. Towards the end of the story in paragraph six he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso Rodriguez says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."""
"The is created by the author in the memoir love mood. To start off, Narciso had so much love and appreciation for his parents decision to immigrate to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" The purpose of the author writing this was to strongly show how truly greatful Narciso is for the hardships his parents had to endure to give him a better life. And also to show the love that Narciso will always have for his parents. Next, the author also expresses how important family and friends are to Narciso. In paragraph two Narciso explains her true love for him family and friends, ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows how immensely immportant his family and friends involvement in her life is to him. In conclusion, the author purposfully showed how important his parents, family, and friends are to him to grasp the meaning of love he feels for his family."
"The creates of Narciso Rodriguez fun mood an enjoyably, happy, author. The author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there & or were there at some point. The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like I honestly was the experiencing his home & the love & kindness of his home. The love & friendship @CAPS1 shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. @CAPS1 shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph. Yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence. ""I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 also especialy shows how hard his parents worked to stay up but still did so much to care for everyone else, all right in paragraph @NUM1."
"The mood of the memoir was happy because, Narciso is happy that their moving, but is still going to miss his old house, but surprised on how his could turn home his new parrents into his new parrents agian."
"The created, Narciso Rodriguez mood a pleasant author, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart."
"The mood that the is created in thhappy memoir happy a author, emotional, and @CAPS1 and caring. The are happy because the are all living together in a perfect place all together.

"In the memoir, the creates definatly mood a author that you can obviously see. He creates a mood of friendship in pharagraph @NUM1, ""our land lord and his daughter (my baby sitter and first friend), lived a bove us and graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not."" Also a feeling of love in pharagraph @NUM1 (again), ""there was often somone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" The final mood he sets is a feeling of gratefulness in pharagraph @NUM3, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". Therefore, the overall mood is his appriciation for his family."
"The set mood the author in different ways Such as describing where he lived before he moved then when he told about his culture and him inheriting it then how he moved to @LOCATION1. He does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish. The biggest part of the mood is talking about where he lived at first, where and what he had. He might have a good start with mood if he told more about the kind of education he got whether he was in Cuba or @LOCATION1. The mood was an overall ok because more about his life but the memoir was not a complete success. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, organized life it was a good tone of mood."

The mood was an overall ok because more about his life but the memoir was not a complete success. But as long as he had a satisfied, happy, organized life it was a good tone of mood."
"remembers hood his child @PERSON1 fondly in his memoir about his home in New Jersey. He creates a setting that many people can relate to because of the general feel of family and heritage. The tone in the memoir is nostalgic as he recalls the hard work of his parents, the people who he considers family, the food and the music. Rodriguez recounts his childhood as many people would, telling the readers how grateful he is to his parents and how warm and welcoming his home seemed. Even in the time during segregation in the US, numerous people from different cultures formed the community of Rodriguez's home. This place that Rodriguez describes his welcoming, and that is exactly the mood of the memoir, welcoming. The author recreates his welcoming, warm, musical home for the reader to visit and enjoy."
"The creates mood a loving, warm author that is felt throughout all of @PERSON1's memoir. For example, ""...passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). Rodriguez's parents loved to cook, something he remembers fondly, and he shares their love to this day. The reader feels this love when reading the line. The reader feels how much @PERSON1 loves Cuban music when reading the next sentence. He even states how much he adores Cuban music even now. Another example, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 Two). @PERSON1 even says ""warm home,"" and warmth is definitly felt while reading this line. The feeling of being a child, of being surrounded by friends and family and many celebrations consumes the reader in a blanket of warmth and love because the reader can imagine this. Another example, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to many people we considered family..."" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS4). @PERSON1's parents provided a warm envirorment opened to loved ones because they are very warm and loving people themselves. @PERSON1 and the reader feel the emotion because of @ORGANIZATION2's writing. one final example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (Rodriguez @CAPS1 @CAPS6). The reader gets a feel of how much Rodriguez loves his parents. @PERSON1 even says  ""love."" His parents are loving people and so is @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 had a warm and loving childhood, which he depicts greatly in his memoir."
"In this memoir, the is showing mood the author as happiness. The mood is happiness because, the author is talking about how Narciso childhood use to be when he was little. The enviroment of his home, and his cuban culture. He mentions how his family came over from dinner sometimes, and the cuban heritage filled the air. Also how the cuban music brought enjoyment. And that just brought him happiness."
"expresses moods many Narciso Rodriguez of happiness in the memoir. @CAPS1 is thankful, ""But, in reallty, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" That statement shows how thankful Narciso is to have such a wonderful life full of great friends and families. The mood of the memoir is very up-beat because Narciso is talking about how great his life has been since @CAPS1 was born. ""I've often told them of my admiration for there strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" That quote shows how proud @CAPS1 is of his parents because they gave up their families, friends, and careers so that @CAPS1 could have a better life in @LOCATION1. Narciso says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" @CAPS1's saying that @CAPS1's very happy that his parents did that for him. Many quotes from the memoir support and set the mood to describe Narciso's life."
 The is cause happness @CAPS1 @CAPS2 think of all the good time her when @CAPS2 was there
"In my opinion I think that the sets mood a loving author. Here are my points to consider. First of all he explains how much he loves his parents. An elaboration of my point is that he uses strong words to show that he loves them alot. For example ""I've often told them of my admiration for thier strength. ""@CAPS1 of all he talks about his family and the love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had. For example ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language."" @CAPS2 of all he explains how much his house meant to him. He talks about the memories he had there. For example ""I will never forget that house...  or the many things I learned there"". In conclusion thats why I think the author sets a loving mood."
"The is in thmore story more mood of a positive is. Because the auther is talking about his home and how he loves it. And how he is praising his parents for takeing a chance in america. but it could be a bad mood because they had to leave their friends behind, but they made it to america and they are a faimly and home."
"I think that the main was created by the author in the memoir love mood. But love branched out into gratitude and hospitality. Love is shown a lot through family in this memoir. The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents. These are the ways that the author shows the mood in the memoir."
"In the memoir, ""creates"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives by creates, the author mood a Narciso Rodriguez for the story. The mood for his story is bittersweet. It is happy, but slightly sad. One way is is shown when @CAPS1 mentions his grand parents. Rodriguez writes ""Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grand parents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It @CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", @CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life.Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" It @CAPS2 that his parents sacrificed for him. Another way Rodriguez creates a bittersweet mood is by admiring his parents. Rodriguez writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageas thing than I cold have ever done."" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 is grateful for what they gave up so @CAPS1 cold have a good life. Rodriguez conveys the happy, yet sad times in the memoir."

"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the creates mood a author of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir."

He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house."

I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house."

"The creates of the memoir mood a very loving, peaceful, and happy author in the story. It is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family. This gives the story a very loving mood and shows how they are all there for each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to lif in our warm home."" This sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very greatful. He is always saying how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to @LOCATION1 to create a better life for him. That is the mood of the memoir throughout the whole passage."
"The is the author has in thhappines memoir happines moode. He states that growing up around in the envirnorment gave him a sence of family, he says that here in my house felt lik cuba. He and his whole family have respected each other and others. Thats the authors mood"
"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the created of Our Lives mood a @CAPS1 that was calming and the author was passionate in what he said and made a happy @CAPS1. ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich  culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This quote shows that the mood was cheerful and calm. The mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house. The author made the mood like an instilled enviroement as like he was growing up in ""this environment instilled in me a great sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."
"While reading Narciso Rodriguez felt mood a certain I. the mood was very serious and grateful. In the memoir Narciso said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. to add, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness. In closing I would like to say Narciso Rodriguez is a very grateful and serious man."
 The is created by the auther that mood of the american dream. It is a very happy and successfull theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had simallar stories. In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious. This short memoir is a great story to bring you mood from sad to hopefull and thankfull that you live in a place you can call home.
"In thmood memoir, ""Narcmoodo Rodriguez"" by Narcmoodo Rodriguez, is mood certain there. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good."
"The creates of the story mood a author to help really emphasize the point of his story. Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1 and try to find new jobs and start new lives. Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir."
"In the memoir I think the is the author creates love mood for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!"
"The is created by the author in the memoir that mood of gratefulness and happiness. The memoir show a pasionate explination of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents Came to the land of @LOCATION1. It shows how happy he is that he can live in @LOCATION1, and lead his own life. He is, and will always be, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life. His gratefulness also affects how his parents raised him, as a Cuban. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is grateful for his family."

This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family.

At one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done. He tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are."
"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez, The mood the author created was loved, because he showed that his gave had up  what they parents from Cuba to come to @LOCATION1 for a better for their children. For example his @CAPS1 worked in a labortory in cuba, and his mom was studying chemical @CAPS2 and they left that to live in Newark, @ORGANIZATION1.

I think the memoir sets the mood family and friend because it talks alot about the meaning of family for example in paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" That means that even though someone is not blood related to you can love them just as much as if they were. @CAPS1 thing the memoir said was ""I learned the real definition of 'family'.

"In the memoir, by Narctogethernesso Rodriguez the is created by the author togetherness mood. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table."" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, ""... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times."

"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the tries to create author a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today. The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood. Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."

"The sets mood a author to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"". By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading."

"The created in the memoir moods many different author. One of the moods the author set was sympathetic or a sense of sympathy for the parents and how they only could live in a one-room furnished apartment. Another mood that was created was the mood of being proud. The author set this when they were talking about how he was born into a simple house and now he adored the music, culture, cooking and family. The author set a mood of sadness when he stated that it was a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. This creates a sad mood because of racism is a bad concept and also because the family is Cuban. Other moods that the author set were moods of gratetfulness and happiness. The author set a mood of gratefulness towards the end of the excerpt when he started saying how he is so thankful for having selfless parents and caring parents. Also when he said he had a humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just a scent and music but life and love. Happiness was the mood of the author because he lived in a good home, had a family full of love and care, and when he said I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."

After all the good memories shared in the apartment Rodriguez attitude about the appartment changed. ""Turned this simple house into a home. His heritage, or culture, filled the air.

"creates moods many Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir. In him memoir Narciso states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" From this statement I feel the mood is loving and kindness. He also states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents. The last statement I thought really changed the mood was ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood when the author says that is I think thankfulness. Those are so examples of how @PERSON1 changed the mood thought out him memoir."

He also appreciates his parents alot because they left cuba to come to the United States so he would have a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be greatful to my parents love and sacrifice""."

It was a very loved environment with friends and family always coming to their table. They were a very caring family. They always had the arms and door wide open to other refugees until They got back on their feet. They were a happy, loving, and caring @CAPS1 family."
"In the memoir created Rodriguez, created moods a few Narciso that are very relatable, yet make you think. One mood is happiness. This reading feels happy from the beginning to hand because it shows how Narciso went through his life, and what he loves about his childhood paragraph @NUM1 says ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" These sentences show he loved the environment he lived in, and what was in his home, which made him happy.Narciso also created a mysterious mood. This mood made you think about your home, and what the word 'family' really means. Narciso's family was a great, big, loving group of people-many of whom were not even related. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This shows thier consideration of family was large, and inspiring.The main mood in this memoir from Narciso is gratefulness. Narciso is grateful for many things, especially being able to live his life the way he did. He is mostly grateful to his parents, as paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice."" Narciso's main mood is gratefullness because he is grateful toward everyone & everything that made his life good, and made him what he is now."

"The creates mood a warm, joyful author in the memoir. He talks about the fond childhood memories he has in a way that gives the reader a warm, joyful feeling inside. For example, although his parents endured hardships in coming to @LOCATION1 from Cuba, they created an inviting home environment. The memoir states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". (¶ @NUM1) This imagery creates a feeling of happiness in the reader. The memoir also says that family isn't nessecarily based on blood. The author's community was like a family. ""All of these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community."" (¶ @NUM2). Additionally, the author explains ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" (¶ @NUM3) @CAPS1, the author talks of ""the warmth of the kitchen"", (¶ @NUM4) and how the air was always filled with love. All of these passages give the reader a mental picture of joyful and warm family gatherings, instilling those feelings. This is important because it shows that the author fondly remembers his childhood. Although his parent's life was tough, they made his life full of joy and warmth, showing that one can make tough experiences into positive situations."
"In the memoir, the creates mood a loving, caring and friendly author. He creates this mood by describing the atmosphere of his home. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The setting of their warm, welcoming home contribute greatly to the mood of the memoir. The author's greatfulness to his parents selflessness and courage also contributes. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" His greatfulness creates a thankful mood through paragraph six and seven, ""it was here were I learned the true definition of ""family"""". This quote helps bring out the love in the mood. The warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the authors point get across in a meaningful way."
"The was and Narciso Rodriguez's memoir love mood and respect. Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family does not only include blood-relatives. Narciso's family included the friends that he had made living in his neighborhood. Majority of Narciso's love went to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @LOCATION1 just to give him a better life. They were fueled by the fact that they were giving a great life to their son, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piles up, and it is clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents."

He loved them for sacrificing their home, family, and friends back in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things-the spirit of generosity, and how important family and friends are. His parents also taught him courage by not being afraid of coming to @LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him that he wouldn't have been so brave.

"In tgives memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, gives mood a he throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven."
"The is of thimportance memoir importance the mood of family. @ORGANIZATION1 says in the beginning how much he loves his cuban culture and heritage. For example, ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" Narciso Rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much. Him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso also became close to other immigrants that were not blood-related to him. ""Growing up in this envirement instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighberhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" Narciso was close to many people who he considered family."

 The created mood the author of love and caring. They alwayS cared about other people
"The created feelings many author in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote shows that the author's family celebrated life and created upbeat feelings. In conclusion, the author of the memoir created many feelings for the reader."
"In this article, the seemed to be authors mood happy and good. For example he likes that his parents are selfish and hard working people and tried to make his life happy. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. He also likes how they tought him things that they know how to do such as cooking. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit eser then how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried. His mood changed to be happy again when he menchened that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home."
"In this memoir the has created more author than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."
 I think that the was that the author created unpleasnt a mood. One beccause he lived in a one room apartment so that must mean that they are poor. and that they live in a poor town without any food.

He tells of how he will always be grateful for his Cuban culture that stayed with him his whole life, and for the selflessness of his parents. The mood that he sets in this memoir is gratefulness. When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, @PERSON1's family still found away to have a home. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave @CAPS1 a sense of family even though his real family was very far away.

"is mood the This created by the author in thmood memoir. In this memoir the author states""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". One reason why this describes the author's mood is that it shows that through all the great times he's had with his family, they have giving him an experience of a life time that he will never forget.

That is how the author describes his mood a lot in this memoir."
"The mood created by the author mood a grateful mood. It's grateful because the boy kept on talking about how thankfull he is for all the stuff he has.

Here @CAPS2 describes how ""passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This gives off a warm, innocent vibe, staging the mood for the memoir @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM2, the mood is expanded so that it also encopasses the welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez says that his ""parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people [they] considered family"". Finally, this excerpt gives off a proud and graceful mood. This pride and gratitude from Narciso Rodriguez is directed toward his parents @CAPS2 uses many words like ""courage"", ""selflessly"", ""struggled"", ""braving"", and ""hardships"" to describe Rawedia and @PERSON2's actions with a proud undertone Rodriguez then talks about how grateful @CAPS2 is to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Then @CAPS2 goes on to talk about how deeply grateful @CAPS2 is towards his parents for all they did for him in great detail. The mood of this memoir is happy, welcoming, warm, grateful, and proud. that would make anyone yearn for the one place where they too felt this feeling circulating around them"
"The was created by narciso Rodriguez appreciation mood, or that's what I got out of it. Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. ""I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them What they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done...""p. @NUM1.

It seems as thogh the excerpt was made to thank those who @CAPS1 lived with. As it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 the excerpt @CAPS1 explains how caring, and generous his family and neighbors were."" My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The author tells about his neighbor making delicious meals all the time, and their dinner table consisted of many neighbors, and blood relatives. The author had a very close relationship with his neighbors."
