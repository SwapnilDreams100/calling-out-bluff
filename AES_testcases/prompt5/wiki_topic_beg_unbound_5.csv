It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him.

(paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

"Once the home of the city's industrial and political leaders, the neighborhood experienced a significant downturn as industry fled Paterson..The library is aided by an advisory board and Friends of the Homer Library..The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1.

Another quote is, ""I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous than I could have ever done."" paragraph @NUM2 This shows that his parents must have done something very hard and gave up a lot to give him to have a good life.

Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again.

He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."
