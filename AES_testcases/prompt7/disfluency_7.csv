"Last year t went to @LOCATION1 city with @CAPS1 mom, @CAPS1 step-dad, @NUM1 of   @CAPS1 brothers, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and, @CAPS1 her @NUM2 kids @PERSON1 and sack.The first place we went was he state of liberty.We got in live for the ferry that takes you to the island where the statue of liberty is.We got in the line for the ferry that toves you to the island where the statue of liberty is.The line was hug antic.I thought, ""@CAPS4 great"" because it was neatly @DATE1 outside and we were going to the waiting here for at least an hour.After about a half hour I noticed that the live goes into a building.I mean ... huh What was in there?well.. erm I wondered.All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line!Yov what fun!At least the building was air conditioned.uh.. I mean ... erm Ahhh We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry.The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full.On the bright side we got to sit down.We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty.It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot.@CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it.We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry.erm I mean ... We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat.uh.. huh I was proud of way self for not complaining.Apparently @CAPS1 mom was to because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me a side and thanked we for being so patient",24
"Patience is something not very many people have.I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not.To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant.It also means you can go through tough times without complaining.Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1.We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge.The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge.well.. Ahhh I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs.I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient.So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk.Ahhh like Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down.So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out).uh.. erm I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes.We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst!I couldn’t do it anymore.um I mean ... I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient.I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge.So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record.Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record.hmm Ahhh That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line.Ahhh so.. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs.I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!",24
"Patience is something that people don't have sometimes.I know I did once.And I 'm gonna tell you about it.huh Ahhh It was a bright sunny day.All my family members were outside.My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill.My mom setting up the table.And me and my sibling playing catch with a football.All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother.Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother.huh like We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it.huh huh like hmm Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up.Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it.I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do.But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him.""@CAPS1 is ready!Come inside"", my mom had called out.""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother.""@CAPS2!Just one last time, I promise I will get it!""he exclaimed.""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded.Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more.As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it!After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it.I was really alod that I had token the time to help him.uh.. hmm I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried.I knew he would get it soon.And he did!erm hmm And that was the time I was patient.",24
"This is a story about a vampire named @CAPS1 who goes to a regular middle school.It was the first day of school and @CAPS1 was waiting in line for his schedule and later combonaiton.And this line was really long.um I mean ... @CAPS1 was late on his first day and he had to get in the way back of the line.The person in front of him kept complaining and @CAPS1 was getting ??.so.. erm This will take forever!” complained the person in front.huh like “@CAPS3,shut up,man.I dont like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining?“exclaimed @CAPS1.Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction.This was not a good sign.@CAPS1 stopped talking and just waited in line .After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music at  his ipod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the  front of the line.Then something bad happened.I mean ... uh.. “@CAPS3 this isn’t my schedule!” said a blonde girl.erm I mean ... The person who was giving  out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule.So @NUM1 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule.If @CAPS1 hadn’t patience,he wouldn’t have standed the @NUM4 minutes in line!hmm I mean ... Good thing he brought his ipod @CAPS5!",24
"Have you ever been patient?Ahhh I mean ...

The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today” then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now.“then we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop.The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes.The day was going by fast.Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said “oh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babies” we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand.I told her everything is going to be alright.” I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies.It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them.I mean ... erm uh.. uh.. Turns out they were all girls.Now we have eight dogs at my house.erm hmm The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier.Tinker, bella, harmony and melony.I love my dogs!",24
