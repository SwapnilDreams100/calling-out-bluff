"I going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.” @CAPS1 get on another ride then”. We already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride..Turn on....Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love,   I'm sailin' away in the morning..Hey!.No way in, no way out   Empty talk and TV shouts   Got to find the way around   No, you ain't no lifer   In this town..Father, Father, Father, Father,   Fall into your hands, I commend my spirit,   Fall into your hands,   Why have you forsaken me,   In your eyes forsaken me,   In your thoughts forsaken me,   In your heart forsaken, me oh,      Trust in my self-righteous suicide,   I, cry, when angels deserve to die,   In my self righteous suicide,   I, cry, when angels deserve to die..Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives   Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight   Future full and empty knocking on my door   Ragged limbed and hungry mama   Miracle no more   (Skin tell me) turn it around   (Head tell me) make it alright   (Nobody dancing)   Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high   Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight   Evening flower all alone, puzzling capeche   Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more      CHORUS   (Skin tell me) turn it around   (Head tell me) make it alright   (Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight   (Breath tell me) turn it around   (Heart tell me) make it alright      (Nobody dancing) it was only make believe   I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here   I wished I had a future, anywhere   I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams   I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin   The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore   I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight      [Chorus]      Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal   I really don't want to know that   The less we know, the better we feel   Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high   Spinning around my little room, miracle      [Chorus]      (Skin tell me) turn it around   (Moon tell me) make it alright   (Nobody dancing) it was only make believe   (Eyes tell me) turn it around   (News tell me) make it alright   (Nobody dancing)      [Chorus].I bet you didn't know something that's absurd,   There's a word I've said more than any other word..Pizza, pizza pie   Every minute, every second   Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy   What a splendid pie?.Now you know what you have to do-oh,   Now you know what's expected of you-hoo-hoo-hoo..Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes,   Be calm..Would I run?.Ripplin' water's flowin' through the pipes   In the walls that are keepin' me warm."

"The time that I was patient was not long ago. It was a day of boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy some candy, I wanted a lorry pop. The man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy. It was @NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like that. It was at the cernical, I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the life gaurd instructer for not letting him on the ride. He was arguing for an half an hour. S was patient waiting for him to stop. I did not complane or argue about the man who was wasting our time..Call me if you need me, woman   Don't feel you're all alone   You've been away for much too long   It's time that you came home      Out on the town, you've been fooling around   I've been talking to myself   I fantasise about the look in your eyes   It's magic in itself      But my heart's stopped healing   And I can't help feeling it's the end of the line   Staying away, don't let them say   That it's the end of the line      Please don't hurt me   Don't desert me, it's the end of the line   Think it over, come on over   It's the end of the line      When you say that you want me woman   Is it just a lie?.Should we start the party?.Do you feel what I am feelin' now..You got it like that   Can i have it like that?.Looking for something?.Bluebirds over the mountain   Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea   Bluebirds over the mountain   Bring my baby to me      A boy and a girl they once found love   To each it seemed like heaven above   He looked into her eyes and said   Ooo wee baby you're so good for my head      Bluebirds over the mountain   Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea   Bluebirds over the mountain   Bring my baby to me      Oh everyone in every land   Please give me a helping hand   If you see her all alone   Oh tell my baby ""won't you please come home?"".These lesions once were lakes..(Dynamite)   I is for instance in I'm irritated, you make me feel alright..So you paint one on, it's the art of imitation..I guess we will never really know why,   But I remember once upon a time..How long has it been   can't remember when   yeah, it's been awhile   years look good on you   but I expect them to   I sure missed that smile   Look you got me grinning   bet I'm blushing too   don't have to be a genius   to see the honest truth   I miss you like Christmas baby   that's just how it's been   there's that kind of message   like we were back when   Sure I've gone on since you baby   lost my heart a time or two   I miss you like Christmas baby   that's it, I just do   The leaves begin to change   the first frost is back again   all the cards and pumpkin pie   Jingle Bells, and Silent Night   And an all familiar end   I can't deny   I miss you like Christmas baby   that's just how it's been   there's that kind of message   like we were back when   Sure I've gone on since you baby   lost my heart a time or two   I miss you like Christmas baby   that's it, I just do   Ooh, I miss you like Christmas baby   that's it, ooh, I just do.I've meet with your kind before."
"Im writing about the time I was patient at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the @LOCATION1 vs. the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the @LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again..I've been watching you waltz all night Diane   Nobody's found a way behind your defenses   They never notice the zap gun in your hand   Until you're pointing it and stunning their senses      All night long, all night long   You'll shoot 'em down because you're waiting for somebody good to come on   All night long, all night long   But you're sleeping with the television on      You say you're looking for someone solid here   You can't be bothered with those 'just for the night' boys   Tonight unless you take some kind of chances dear   Tomorrow morning you'll wake up with a white noise      All night long, all night long   You're only standing there 'cause somebody once did somebody wrong   All night long, all night long   But you'll be sleeping with the television on      You're eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me   But your attitude is ""don't waste my time""   Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me   But you won't hear a word 'cause it just might be the same old line      This isn't really easy for me to say Diane   I know you don't need anybody's protection   I really wish I was less of a thinking man   And more a fool who's not afraid of rejection      All night long, all night long   I'll just be standing here 'cause I know I don't have the guts to come on   All night long, all night long   And I'll be sleeping with the television on      You're eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me   But my attitude is ""boy, don't waste my time""   Your eyes are saying talk to me, talk to me   But I won't say a word 'cause it just might be somebody else's same old line      All night long, all night long   We're only standing here 'cause somebody might do somebody wrong   All night long, all night long   And we'll be sleeping with the television on   Sleeping with the television on   Sleeping with the television on.I got a booking with the airlines   Pack up and going to go   I'm gonna leave here by plane, darling   Because railway is much too slow   I'm goin' back to my hometown   Where I'm better known   'Cause you haven't done nothing, darling   But ruin a happy home   Now, when the sun sinks in the hillside   The one you love will be gone   And I know I will be blue darling   But somehow I'll just travel on   Now, would you rather care to kiss me   Or would you prefer to just say goodbye   'Cause I will turn and leave you darling   I don't want to see you cry.Lets Go!.You are the hope of my soul   You are the sun in my world   I lay down my heart   My life's in your loving hands   More than my hopes and my dreams   More than what my eyes could see   Your love consumes me   You grace is all that I need   Chorus:   For you are my god   You are my king   I'll sing your name   And I'll shout out your fame   In your presence is where I belong   For you are my god   You are my king   Jesus you only you are my everything.And out isn't perfect   My friends I'll say it too   Stay my case of which I'm certain   I've lived a life as full   I've traveled each and every highway   Oh and more as more gets   I did it my way   Regrets I've had a few   But they're too few to mention   I did what I had   It's all through without exemption   I play each charted course   I've traveled each and every byway   And more much more than this   I did it my way   Well twice I'm sure you knew   When I bit off more than I could chew   I knew it all without a doubt   I ate it up and I had to spit it out   I passed it on and I stood tall   And I did it my way.Music: Michael W.

"Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn’t know why she didn’t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but it didn’t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn’t hear her. @PERSON1 isn’t fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesn’t like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don’t know if they’ll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I’ve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad..[Repeat: x2]   Let a killer fuck you..Fighting isn't my friend   When I will never have my friend   Fighting silence as a friend   I'm silent and I can't turn it around      And she improvised   Cause she was supervised   And I was idolized   I was idolized   For those...

" Their was a time when I was patient when I went to the barber shop and my family and I was going on a trip and I had to get my haircut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop was packed so the guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted. After those people were done he never call me up so he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me wait until he came out the restroom then five more people came in so that’s when my mom called my phone and asked me was I done because I been up their from @NUM1 to @NUM2 and she said go to some one else chair because was was about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick my stuff will be leaving at @NUM3 a.m the next morning..Anonymous and undemanding   Enchantment passing through   My secrets and my confidence is safe enough in you      Why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met   Someone who in hours from now I'll certainly forget?.If you ever go across the sea to Ireland   Then maybe at the closing of your day   You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh      And see the sun go down on Galway Bay   Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream   The women in the meadow making hay   And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin      And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play   For the breezes blowing o'er the seas from Ireland   Are perfumed by the heather as they bloom   And the women in the uplands diggin' praties      Speak a language that the strangers do not know   For the stranger came and tried to teach us their way   They scorned us just for being what we are   But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams      Or light a penny candle from a star   And if there's going to be a life hereafter   And somehow I am sure there's going to be   I will ask my god to let me make my heaven   In that dear land across the Irish sea.For you know that I must say goodbye..But of all these friends and lovers,   There is no one compares with you..Yes, how many ears must one man have   Before he can hear people cry?.What if I have forgotten how?.Listen   I was born on the other side   Just always looking to you   I made it over the great divide   Now I'm coming for you      Your forces lined up in battle   Your soldiers and your machines   The sun been blacked out by shadows   The darkest hour now you've ever seen      And I'm easy and I'm serious   They try and tear me down   You want me baby I dare you   Try and tear me down      I rose up on the doctor's slab   Like Lazarus from the pit   And everyone wants to take a stab   Decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit      I've been held up on money   I've been beaten out of spite   You want a piece of me honey?.I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer   I'm just a fool I guess   But I just can't go on dying like this      Here I am again, it's four AM   I think I'll play that song again   The one called ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry""   And I'll wonder where you are tonight   I don't know, I just don't know   But I just can't go on dying like this      Can I see you tonight?.Must be something that he can't quite say,   He just doesn't want to leave it that way..He was born so far away   So the story's told   We remember Christmas Day   When winter days grow cold      With the time it passes by   We put away the trim   Then we live and wonder why   We can't remember Him      The Christmas star shines once a year   And then it fades away   Keep the spirit in your heart   It's Christmas everyday (christmas everyday)      It's not the bells and it's not the snow   And it's not the gifts we get   But He was born so long ago   It's easy to forget      Peace on earth, good will too men   But men can't go alone   We get lost along the way   But He can bring us home      Remember Him throughout the year   Without the star above   He left us all a Christmas gift   He left the gift of love      The Christmas star shines once a year   And then it fades away   Keep the spirit in your heart   And it's Christmas every day.Sweet and timely whore, take me home..Where do I begin?"
"It was my first camping trip! Well, we went camping when I was one but I don’t remenber a lot. I was super excited! So, I’m sorry if I could’nt help but wonder @CAPS1 the ? are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasn’t really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said “daddy when are we gonna be there?” I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, I didn’t I took what I had learnt earier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every one in a while everyone is a little impatient..Too much walking shoes worn thin   Too much trippin' and my soul's worn thin   Time to catch her ride it leaves today,   Her name is what it means   Too much walking shoe worn thin   Time to take her home,   Her dizzy head is conscious laden..And along came something sacred   I never knew what I found   The demons dance around, elated   They're hurting me      I put my wall up each day   You tear it down   I hide in my space   The space you found   And one of these days   I'll come unbound   The feelings I hate   Will finally drown      Falling awake in a nightmare   Images of horror abound   Thought I stumbled upon salvation   Hell I found      I put my wall up each day   You tear it down   I hide in my space   The space you found   And one of these days   I'll come unbound   The feelings I hate   Will finally drown      Well, I'll never be the same   It's the greatest lie ever told   No, I'll never be the same   I sold my soul      I put my wall up each day   You tear it down   I hide in my space   The space you found   And one of these days   I'll come unbound   The feelings I hate   Will finally drown.I try to get away, and yet I stick around   So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground      My intention, may I arrive at eight?.I just can't help but to wonder,   Which of us do you love..he world was my oyster -

" A time of when I was patient was when me & my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to alow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parent were discussing if we should or shouldn’t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad’s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn’t resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn’t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bring the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. He was surprised and over joyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. we all fell love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!.Swift or Rift,   Listen to my gears shift   I'm blasting, I'm blasting   Kinda like shaft, so you can say I'm shafting   Olde English filled my mind, and I came up with a funky rhyme      I'm gonna knock you out   Mama said knock you out   I'm gonna knock you out   Mama said knock you out   I'm gonna knock you out   Mama said knock you out   I'm gonna knock you out   Mama said knock you out      Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio, UH   I just don't know   What made you forget that I was raw   But now I gotta new tour   I'm going insane   Startin' the hurricane   Releasin' pain   Lettin' you know   You can't gain or maintain   Unless you say my name   Rippin'   Killin'   Diggin' and drillin' a hole   Pass the Old Gold      I'm gonna knock you out   Mama said knock you out   I'm gonna knock you out   Mama said knock you out   I'm gonna knock you out   Mama said knock you out   I'm gonna knock you out   Mama said knock you out      Shotgun blasts are heard   When I rip and kill at will   The man of the hour, tower of power   I'll devour   I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand   That I'm not your average man   When I gotta jammy in my hand   Damn!.What God give me a plan for   If He won't help me do it?.Girl, don't you say   Girl, don't you make   Girl, don't you make   Make me cry   Make me cry      You had my life   In the palm of your hand   Why you threw it away   I'll never ever understand      You took away the best part   The best part of me   You took away, you   How cruel could you be?.What are we supposed to do   After all that we've been through   When everything that felt so right is wrong   Now that the love is gone?.You're gonna be mine, little girl,   You've been through 18 years of pain..Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh   If I took you home, it'd be a home run   Show me how you do      I want to shut down the club, with you   Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh      I like crazy, foolish, stupid   Party going wild, fist pumping   Music, I might lose it   Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)   I don't care the night, she don't care we like   Almost dared the right five   Ready to get live, ain't no surprise   Take me so high, jump and don't stop   Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man   When they heading my van, mic check one two   Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose   Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow   Gotta break loose cause that's the motto   Club shuts down, a hundred super models      Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh   If I took you home, it'd be a home run   Show me how you do      I wanna shut down the club, with you   Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh      Party rocker, fa-show stopper, more shampoo   Number one, club popper   Got a hangover like too much vodka   Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool   No doubt by the end of the night   Got the clothes coming off til I make that move   Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof   All black shades when the sun come through   Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show   What happens to that body, it's a private show   Stays right here, private show   I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain   Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne   My life, coming harder when we hit fame   Do you busy with the bail, we get insane      Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh   If I took you home, it'd be a home run   Show me how you do      I want to shut down the club, with you   Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh      I am a wild one, break me in   Saddle me up and lets begin   I am a wild one, tame me now   Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl      Show you another side of me   A side you would never thought you would see   Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough   I hear you like the wild stuff      Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh   If I took you home, it'd be a home run   Show me how you'll do   I want to shut down the club, with you   Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones) ooh      I am a wild one break me in   Saddle me up and let's begin   I am a wild one tame me now   Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl.The Kremlin says this can't be true      Heads will roll 'cause this won't do      Reuther   Tass and cbs said this story is the best..I've seen what I was -

"My sister is very patient unlik my brothers and me. Well my sibling and me had are proggress reports coming and I was so excited to see what I got, and my brothers were anxious and we work always both a mom saying when are they coming did you them. But my sister was always calm and patient. Then the day they arrived we then got nervous except @PERSON1. The reason why she is patient is because she trys to keep off her mind by sleeping or reading. But back to report cards we opened them and then everyone was happy even @CAPS1 because we got good grades. Then after that my brothers and me learned from my sister and now we all have patience..I can love   I can reach the heavens above....Funny how love is everywhere just look and see   Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be   Funny how love is every song in every key   Funny how love is coming home in time for tea   Funny funny funny oh   Funny how love is the end of the lies   When the truth begins tomorrow comes   Tomorrow brings tomorrow brings love   In the shape of things   That's what love is that's what love is      Funny how love can break your heart so suddenly   Funny how love came tumbling down with Adam and Eve   Funny how love is running wild feeling free   Funny how love is coming home in time for tea   Funny funny funny oh   From the earth below to the heavens above   That's how far and funny is love   At any time anywhere   If you gotta make love do it everywhere   That's what love is that's what love is      Funny how love is everywhere just look and see   Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be   Funny how love is every song in every key   Funny how love is when you gotta hurry   'Cause you're late for tea   Funny funny funny oh   Tomorrow comes tomorrow brings   Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things   At any time anywhere   If you gotta make love do it everywhere   That's what love is that's what love is.There will be a time in your life   When you'll need me the most   But I won't be there   There will be a time in your life   When you won't need me at all   I won't be there   But while I've got the chance   I'm gonna tell you what I know   About this world we're living in   It may seem so beautiful   From where you are   It may look so innocent   In your eyes   But let me tell you   It's not a bed of roses      Good things come to those   Who got out and made them happen   They don't come to those who wait      Good things come to those   Who got out and made them happen   They don't come to those who wait      Good things come to those   Who got out and made them happen   They don't come to those who wait      I can sit here and teach you   Every trick in the book   But at the end of the day   It is your life      Good things come to those   Who got out and made them happen   They don't come to those who wait      Good things come to those   Who got out and made them happen   They don't come to those who wait      Good things come to those   Who got out and made them happen   They don't come to those who wait      You don't have to worry   The future is in your hands.Uhh, come on   Get up      On the Left, On the Left, left, right left   On the Left, On the Left, left, right left   On the Left, On the Left, left, right left   On the Left, Uhh, On the Left, left, right      Here it comes the sound of terror from above   He flex his Texas twisted tounge   The poor lined up to kill in desert slums   For oil that boil beneath the desert sun   Now we spit flame flip this game   All the targets are taking aim   All targets are taking aim   We're the targets are taking aim.Something in here's not right today   Why am I so uptight today?.I saw a little story in the newspaper about the size of a pack of cigarettes -

"I know I can I said to myself as I was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself. I bent backwards tried kicking over and feel! Errg! I stood back up and asked @PERSON1 my coach, “@CAPS1 my shoulders right?” @CAPS2 @CAPS1 your shoulder the kick over. “@CAPS3 got it” I said. As I bent backwards again I slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then I pushed my shoulders forward and I did it! I finally did it by myself! Later that night I showed my mom I could do it. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom face could never be replaced @CAPS4 was so proud of me. Then I @CAPS4 ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said “thank you for being so patient.” @CAPS4 said “@CAPS5 for you baby.”.I had great plans for new government, new law and churches..Pardon the way that I stare   There's nothing else to compare   The site of you leaves me weak   There are no words left to speak   But if you feel like I feel   Please let me know that it's real   Your just too good to be true   Can't take my eyes off of you..Say you'll survive   Down Endless Street   Down Endless Street   Down Endless Street      Well say you'll be fine   When you walk out that door   Oh, will it be that easy   To see me no more?.(A-M-E-are-I-C-A)..I understand..If you hate them boys, shake it..Ain't it funny how time slips away..If songs were lines   In a conversation   The situation would be fine.Outside the world reverberates   I need the strength I see in her   I need the love I feel inside   We talk about leaving behind the hell we're in   We laugh about making it out alive      Yeah, see anita, yeah   She's my pretty girl   Blind eyes to the world outside   No more so than the rest of the world...

But the next day we bought him a lot of other games that were brand new. So as he tried the games he still couldn`t do it. So than he asked me if I can help him so I helped him but it still didn`t work until I cleared up the play station than we had to wait patiently and than finaly at??? but  my little brother and I say “ work, work, work, work” until it went on.

" A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shoping. My dad was at work and my mom took me and my older sisters shoping it was boring but it was kind of full because some of clothes in the store had boys on one side and girls on the other. One store only had girl       clothes which I hated. But I didn't say anything after that since I was so patient my my asked me where to you want to go? I said to best buy I got a game it was colloge football oq.

"Patience is important in life. Something when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn’t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn’t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn’t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn’t have patience. But if they did that wouldn’t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not..She wants to know where I've been   She's got the gloves on again   She thinks she's smooth now I'm saying   I'm not going down (I'm not going down)   You say this ain't the end to me   Fall down, pull the rug under me   Feels like I'm falling but I tell you   I'm not going down   One day, you'll be the end of me   Go blind, pull the wool over me   Feels like I'm falling but I tell you   I'm not going down   Because you push me over the edge   Tired of wasting my time, tired of wasting my breath   Because you push me over the edge   Tired of wasting my time   And you're putting me through this again (through this again)   She wants to fight and I've been drinking   We put the walls up again   I know she's right that I'm tripping   But I'm not going down   Repeat Chorus   Because you   Never did try   Never did look to see that I'm alright (whoa)   Because you're   Always right   Gotta fight   Always want to know (whoa)   Because you.They hold me and they promise me things,   And when the tides high I cry like a little baby..I got something to find,   There's one thing I really need..Give thanks to Allah,   For the moon and the stars   Prays in all day full,   What is and what was   Take hold of your iman   Don't give in   to shaitan   Oh you who believe please give thanks to Allah..Workin' in the coal mine   Goin' on down, down   Workin' in a coal mine   Oops, about to slip down   Workin' in a coal mine   Goin' on down, down   Workin' in a coal mine   Oops, about to slip down      'Cause I make a little money   Haulin' coal by the ton   When Saturday rolls around   I'm too tired for havin' fun      Workin' in the coal mine   Goin' on down, down   Workin' in a coal mine   Oops, about to slip down   Workin' in a coal mine   Goin' on down, down   Workin' in a coal mine   Oops, about to slip down      Lord I'm so tired   How long can this go on?.Are you feelin' me?.If you're not the one for me   Why do I hate the idea of being free?.But of all these friends and lovers,   There is no one compares with you..When I wake up feeling victimized   There is nothing   That can stop my eyes   From crying      When you put the pressure   Down on me   Cause I don't quite fit   Your imagery   I'm trying      I'm no superman      [Chorus].I've been searching so hard to find   Tell me, How could I have been so blind?.I guess I was a shoulder to cry on      A face on a lover with a fire in his heart   A man under cover but you tore me apart   Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart   But the very next day you gave it away   This year, to save me from tears   I'll give it to someone special      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart   But the very next day you gave it away   This year, to save me from tears   I'll give it to someone special      A face on a lover with a fire in his heart   A man under cover but you tore him apart   Maybe next year I'll give it to someone   I'll give it to someone special.Let's keep the heart in the country, 'cause that's where it should always be."

"That is the time I was to be patient.  Hope you enjoyed I am not a very patient person very rarely have I been patient. But, there is sometimes I was. I still remember three years ago when I was in @NUM1 grade my whole day was full of patience. That day I was getting picked up early. I was getting picked up early from school because that night I was going to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news. My friend went a few days before and said it was a good @ORGANIZATION1. When it was getting close to the end of the day the speaker in my classroom went “@CAPS1” then the lady and I had ?????????? for an early ?? mission I had been waiting for the moment! After I got picked up we went and picked my cousins up from school too!

don't know      But maybe that's the new concept   Where the smurfs are like the bees in the garden now   They live in mushrooms, the new sin symbols   And where the smurfette's forced to sell her   But how   Said how      They forced you to submit your soul   Poor lady in blue she sings      Small shy, oh my oh my   Won't even try   To make something out of himself   And if you look, please

 And so in my new concept   The smurfette is risen as feminine   The smurfs are the archetype   Of what societies could be   And I'd like to live in mushrooms   I'll come with you little silly smurfs   Smurfette don't be worried   Of being the only woman now      I'll be with you in these dark nights   When they'll try to submit you   Poor lady in blue   We'll be together."", we'll say, ""No man""

"Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did!

"Patience is a virtue I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something take too long. In @ORGANIZATION1 seriously  there was an event called @CAPS1. It was raising and many people wanted to see if @CAPS2 would close down. The rain inocaculously did stop but I had to wait until @TIME1. It was only six for! So in other words my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was a unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally they let us in at @TIME2, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, I’m glad I was patient enough.

" A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words “practice makes perfect” she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time.

"I patience is a privilege I generally don't have, @CAPS1, I made an exception, though. @CAPS3 brother, @PERSON1 ran out to the car running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was,"" @CAPS2 need to talk."" @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded."" @CAPS4 about at @NUM1?""

"Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?’’ “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .” “Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient , it might’ve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day..I do any and everything you want to   Make your girl go oooh-oooh   Why's he so fly   She beeps me, whenever she wanna get freaky   You can get mad if you want Say what ever you want   But shes still gonna give it up      She likes it my way, my way,   You can't satisfy her needs   She keeps running back to see me do it   My way, my way   What I say goes, and I'm in control      Bad ass senoritas to sweaters with kicks   New kicksit's all in the mix   Don't turn no tricks, they turn for me   Catchin' bricks don't concern me      So forget it Lil midget, my mind on seven digits   Before I pay heaven's skies a visit, now it   I'm pullin' all stops, lockin' down all spots   Sayin' you can't front on me      So from this day forth you know I'm all about heat   And what I do be the major league   That's why your girlfriend's paging me   And she know like he know, you don't see her like I see her      So she's out the do'   Shot gun in my drop havin' fun with the Don, system, Bassun   Conversation about how she be chasin' me   And facin' me sayin' give it to me now, baby      She likes it my way, my way,   You can't satasify her needs   She keeps running bak to see me do it   My way, my way   What I say goes, and I'm in control      Don't check me   It was your girl who let me   Take it this far then, ooh-wee   She had to have it every chance that she could get      But you think I'm a baller   And I ain't gonna call her   Clip that, you can get mad if you want to   Say whatever you want....Here I stand head in hand   Turn my face to the wall   If she's gone I can't go on   Feelin' two-foot small   Everywhere people stare   Each and every day   I can see them laugh at me   And I hear them say   Hey you've got to hide your love away   Hey you've got to hide your love away   How could I even try   I can never win   Hearing them, seeing them   In the state I'm in   How could she say to me   Love will find a way   Gather round all you clowns   Let me hear you say   Hey you've got to hide your love away   Hey you've got to hide your love away.So damn lucky, when you went on ahead   You say, you say   I see you later   I heard what you said a few minutes later   I'm sliding   Everything's different, again      Oh my God, wait and see   What will soon become of me?.Ohh, ah, yeah      U work so hard, U really do   I don't think that anyone could ever work as hard as U   Hot desert sun, U can feel the heat   Every drop of sweat on your brow is what I am so U best believe      [Chorus:]   I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)   I got 1,000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home, baby (Ooh woo)      When U give 'em your all, and still it's only second best   U can come and lay your head upon your baby's chest   Every one of your worries, all your miseries (All your miseries)   U can put them in the little book and ship them off 2 sea   Cuz...

"My family and I were going to @LOCATION1 for @DATE1 break one year I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights untill we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours untill we got there. Then we checked are bags went throug securely, and went to go and find our plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours untill the plane came. Then we got off that plane we went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed to! So we had to wait a few hours again untill the plane came. Then we had to sit through another plane ride untill we finally got to @LOCATION1. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there..(Prevail)   Metamorphis, battle-axe Fortress..How long can you stand   Tightening up   Avoiding the fight   Avoiding the truth   Tighten the smile   Tighten the lie   Will you get what you want   To be cursed with your dreams   I hope for your sake   Something gets in the way      How long can you stand   Living under the lens   The kiss of success   The ensuing, all consuming, mess      Message of love   They arrive everyday   People you touch   Wasting away   People you don't know   Give you no choice      And you're sick to your stomach   At the sound of your voice   And the shape of your face   And the sound of your name   They send you pictures of yourself   It's someone you don't know   And they call you a genius   Cause you're easier to sell   But the fire in your belly   That gave you the songs   Is suddenly gone   And you feel like a fake   Is that what you want?.Mr. Mambo (repeat and fade with following)   Please Mr. Mambo   Strike up the combo   And let this music sway   Please Mr. Mambo   Just one more song now   So we can dance the night away   Please Mr. Mambo   Strike up the combo   So we can shake the night away.Took a peek at the dirt about Demi Moore..Everybody wanna be fly til you swat 'em   But who am I to talk?.I know you ain't already out,   Fuck all that edge you smoked,   You a clucker and I'm your fucking clicking brother,   I know you fucked that hooker, you couldn't tell no other,   I'm always fucking hookers, call me when your feeling wicked,   And wicked chill out in the gutters get dirty and kick it,   Cause I'm your motherfucker,   I'm that motherfucking motherfucking scrubby times let me be your   Scrubby brother      Cause I do this all the time (the weight of my life)   Weight of my life   Weight of my life   Weight of my life   Weight of my life      You need a fucking hitman who the shit with a quick plan?.I saw a picture of a stranger but I don't understand..She could take your fantasy and make it a reality..[Chorus: x2]   Bring in the noise   Bring down the house   We came here to turn the party out   Say c'mon c'mon lets raise the roof   And give 'em proof that we can get loose y'all      We need to get down   The scene is so so right   Everybody's in the house tonight   Loose your mind   Let your body take control   You've got that feeling in your soul      I've got that feeling baby   You know it drives me crazy   And all I want to do is hit the floor   I want to shout it though   So make it louder y'all   And turn it up some more..And taxi drivers really tax my patience,   If they vanished, would it really be a crime?.Long time ago   Where have all the graveyards gone?.Can you tie them in a bow?"
"One day my family and me where going to @PERSON1 to see jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After me and my brother got home from school we left to go to @LOCATION2 as we where travelling  we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there . Then we seen a sign  that says “you are how leaving @LOCATION3” and another sign that said you are how entering @LOCATION1 and that’s when  it happened the traffic jam. We where going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1.m how smart was that not very but the worst part was the waiting I t  lasted for hours just sitting there but we found ways to away ourselves. Like watch the sea @PERSON2’s ,waves, and  look at the buildings there. That’s my example of patience..Standing with my enemies   Hung on my horns   With haste and reverie   Killing with charm      Only happy when you hurt   Only deadly in a swarm   Only healthy in the dirt   Only empty in your arms      I play, I'm sick and tame   Drawing the hordes   I wait, and show the lame   The meaning of harm   The skull beneath my feet   Like feathers in sand   I graze among the graves   A feeling of peace      Only bending when you break   Only feeding when you're cold   Only healing when you ache   Only feeling when you don't.Did you get your race card?.Houses small..When we do it   (the great big it)   I hope it's we and not just me   When we do it   Something happens   And it's bigger than the both of us   And for a second   There's no trouble   And the world outside goes away   The clock on the wall   Between us stops   Then the world outside blows away   You make me lose my body   And nothing could be better   You make me lose my body   It's like we've died and gone to heaven   You make me lose my body   When we do it   (the universal it)   I know it's we and not just me   When we do it.Goin' down the road feelin' bad..I'm working hard tryin' to pull it together..I am the black crow king   Keeper of the trodden corn   I am the black crow king   Won't say it again   And the rain it raineth daily..I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss   I think I've had enough of this..A friend of mine she cries at night,   And she calls me on the phone   Sees babies everywhere she goes   And she wants one of her own..Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground   Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground   Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground   Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground!.I'll teach him how to act,   I'll remould and reshape him..Oh baby   Don't let it be."
"Patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. Taking a three hour carride is a perfect example of patience. Exactly like what I experienced.

"That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Lets go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to @LOCATION1. This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the @NUM1 children. When we finaly took off we were in turbulence the whole @NUM2 hour flight. Which ment we couldn’t get up, @CAPS1 food, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the @CAPS4! Flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops till we got to the @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a : memory I will never forget.

" Have you ever had tot waiting @NUM1 hour line? this is what it was like for me and @CAPS1. We were at ceder point waiting to ride too thrill dragster. We had just got there the first thing we decided to do was ride the top thrill dragseter but the line was about a three hour wait we went anyway.  We had just fineshed our first hour of waiting but it felt like three. I knew I had to be patient and relaxe but it just felt like forever. after anthor hour my stomach started to growl I checked my watch it was @NUM2 we had got here at @NUM3 I was starving and tiered but I stayed finaly an hour later it was our turn when I got off I knew it had been worth it to be patient. In conclusion I learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life..A fool out of me   Why don't you come on over valerie?.We are the fortunate ones,   Imitations of rebellion!.I have seen   All of your remedies   Now wont you let me please go home..Your gone dude..Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,   Gold I bring to crown him again   King for ever, ceasing never over us all to reign..Send me, send me no wine,   To send my love away..Did you know when the journey started   That wed ever reach that point   Many years we sailed together   Now its time to say goodbye   You don't know what I've been going through   haven't heard that much from you   Isolation is a nice flower   Now I wonder what to do   You never know when your dreams come true   Is it good for you, is it good for you   On our ship of fools were drifting along the shores never seen before   When you told me that youre leaving   Cause the stakes were much too high   I was wondring why you said so   Since we still got wings to fly   I will never ever give up   Just as long as I am here   Till the end Ill spread my wings   And raise my dreams against your fears   You never know when your dreams come true   Is it good for you, is it good for you   On our ship of fools were drifting along the shores never seen before....And no I didn't even come..Robin in the rain,   You don't mind the weather   Showers always make you gay..Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do..Need I explain?.People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave   Their problems in the arms of others, running to their mothers   Lasting love is such a funny thing   When you're in love you're on the wings   You're not in love, it's good for you   'cause you can do the things you want to do      It's you big chance, to take it baby   It's you big chance, you'll make it baby      When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you   You'll be thinkin' how you hurt me when I needed you beside me   In the night is such a lonely time   I dream of you and that's a sign   It means that I am still a fool   And I am still so much in love with you      It's your big chance, so take it baby   It's your big chance, don't fake it baby      Big chance   Hot chance"

"I am never paitent, but which I am it is only once and a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I’m doing nothing and it is really quiet. I get really bad headaches. In school for example and I’m waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ???everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. When I wait to long I feel lazy and tired because I’m not moving at all. I get buggy when I’m paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can’t be paitent very long or I get buggy.

"When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn’t put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didn’t know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game.

We sat for @NUM1 minutes band then we hear the doctor calling my name. We go inside the doctors room and I sit down he does all this things. Later he yells us that we have to meet one more doctor. We sat down again and we waited. Then we hear my name again so we go. The worst thing was that I saw a medicine on the table and I was really scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that she took the medicine and was going through it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she through the medicine in my eyes it burned a little. I didn`t want her to do the other. I wanted to just stand up and run outside, but I couldn`t she did the other eye and told me to now keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back she me that was it, and we were done there.

"Patient, that’s all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing..I will be your storm at seas      And I'll be (your sharp intake of breath)..And if it's really one   I'ma solve it   don't know how   You handled other dudes   But I'm not them   Girl you runnin around   Got 'em thinkin   That I can't handle my thang   Ooh, are you crazy?.Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,   Is what makes the world rotate..Everybody, let's play!.Writer      [Jr Writer] [Chorus:]   To all my hustlers, rock smugglers, stugglers   Block bubblers, pushers, cookers pot jugglers   What's the word y'all, Flip that herb raw   Clap.......

"A time when I was pacient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was  babysitting were acting up. It hard for me to get them to calm down. But , I noticed that if I was pacient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be pacient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being pacient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being  a lot when  I was babysitting them the next time too..I'm longing for your presence Lord   Envelop me within the clouds..Hide in the darkness til its getting light..You were good   I was bad   I just want everything you had   Good loving is meant for two   A bit for me and a bit for you   Alright, oh yeah   C'mon and make my bed   Oh, baby, baby, I...

"Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. “@CAPS1’s that?” I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2’t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “ro” and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom..Let's do this bottle right..Leave old pictures in the past   Donate every dime you have?.Ship of fools, ship of fools..Feuilly   Twenty rifles good as new..We could knock nine down and leave one in the hole   Wouldn't be here if the Athenia hadn't sunk   Or if dear 'ol dad hadn't got so drunk   Every other day is a kick in the shin   Every other day it's like the day just went   But you make it alright, you make it okay   You make me sorta glad that I waited till today   You're pretty as a penny   Rollerskate skinny   You're pretty as a penny   Rollerskate skinny   Rollerskate skinny and the terrible two's   Two years in and it's time to choose   Love feels good when it sits right down   Puts its feet up on the table it and sends a bowl around   Ain't nobody gonna see eye to eye   With a girl who's only gonna stand collarbone high   Rain's gonna come in fair-sized drips   We're gonna go to heaven wearing paper-hat ships   You're pretty as a penny   Rollerskate skinny   You're pretty as a penny   Rollerskate skinny   I believe in love but it don't believe in   I believe in love but it don't believe in me   I believe in love but it don't believe in me   No it don't believe in   Don't believe in.Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear..You can always tell the winners   The saints and the sinners   Down at the starting line   I'm a lucid vision   Of the unforgiven   I'm your wave-toss guy      King-size, we were crushin'   Trouble by the dozen   Stakes have never been higher   Come back when you're younger   'Cause I can feel the thunder   1-800-GUITAR      Ooooh yeahhh   We came, we came, we came through blood and fire   We came, we came, we came through blood and fire      Now look at all of the people here tonight      It's a world of fools   That's just what's expected   None of 'em know it   Or even suspect it   God must love the lazy   Shiftless and the crazy   Puttin' so many in life      Ooooh yeahhh      We came, we came, we came through blood and fire   We came, we came, we came through blood and fire      Now look at all of the people here tonight      Forgotten empires   Lost victories long past   Every time I bloomed again   I thought it was the last   And then something crazy happens   And boom!.Come on, ring those bells,   Light the Christmas tree,   Lord is the King   Born for you and me..Is there something I should know?.Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me, touched my heart and went right through..ohh   Everybody's got a dark side   Do you love me?.I feel the fingerprints   That you left on my heart   You played a game of love   And then you said we had to part   You left me all alone   And as the teardrops start   I feel the fingerprints   Of sorrow on my heart      I know you didn't mean to be unkind   And hurt me so   And you've made up your mind   But I just thought you ought to know      That when the day is through   I think of only you   I sit alone and dream   And think of things we didn't do   Now I am all alone   And as the teardrops start   I feel the fingerprints   That you left on my heart      And when the day is through   I think of only you   I sit alone and dream   And think of things we didn't do   Now I am all alone   And as the teardrops start   I feel the fingerprints   That you left on my heart"
" Once apoon a time there was a place called unpaciente land. But on grumpy lane lived a little girl namend @ORGANIZATION1. She was the most patient girl ever. One day @ORGANIZATION1 went to get her hair cut “at mtso fast saloon!” When @ORGANIZATION1 got there everyone was screaming at @CAPS1 the hair cutter and @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said hey if you want your hair to look good sit down and be quiet and everybody did. @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a beautiful haircut just like everybody else and then @ORGANIZATION1 because the mayor of unpaciente  land renamed it @CAPS2 land from that day forward every body was pacient..You say don't be blue   Is that the best you can do?.Just when I think these times,   Have gotten the best of me..This pain won't peel   The fibres of my life won't heal.How wrong could it be?.you show it   Oh, oh my love.Shut up!.We're gonna rock so hard, we're gonna let it go   If ya want it loud, hey let me know   It's been a while since we've been gone   We had it tough, now the hurt is gone   Well, when the day is done, when the day is through   Listen close this is what we'll do   Comin' down like a ton of lead,   Like a ton of lead that's what I said   It's been a long time comin'...

"A Time when I was Patient  A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step mom & brother. He was getting his knee looked at; @CAPS1 were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually I’m not very patient usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that I’m really impatient. For some reason when I’m really excited I’m fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient..No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight..I could show you a high time, living the good life, don't be that way..Barefoot in the summer,   cold in stormy weather..How the hell did he fit, em all into such a small place?.Keep falling..While you're deciding, I've been finding   Looking around in the here and now      If I've been taught from the beginning   Would my fears now by winning?.The world looks so different to me   Everything's so pretty I see   I get a feeling that I never knew   Every time that I look at you..A very merry christmas to all of you!.Help me find the hand,   That knows where I've been..Wanted you, you're out of range..The birds like leaves on Winterwood,   Sing hopeful songs on dismal days..[Chorus]   So cry on my shoulder and let's both get over the bad."
"When I was patient I had no fears no argument but I had a good deal .I had a @CAPS1  @CAPS4 was so good my sister @PERSON1 said “@CAPS2 I get some”  I said “ @CAPS3 you @CAPS2” @CAPS4 was a miracle so I was driving her car at the gasstation .I went to @ORGANIZATION1 .I said ,”@NUM1 @CAPS5 please “ @CAPS4 was a cousin of mine and she said ,” @NUM2 days ago “ I was like “ wow “ @PERSON1 called my phone because @CAPS4 was my daddy’s weekend she said ,” get down there now I was like  wow..The simple and traditional ways of stone..Oh, don't ya know, don't ya know   It's a foolish thing that you do?.Now,right now   Let the fire inside you   Burn like I burn      [Chorus]      Deep inside   Deep inside me   Deep inside me   Deep inside.I'd been up there forever, but her arms were finally around me..And now we fly through the stars..Have there been times to laugh   And times you really want to cry   Finding reasons to believe her   'Cause you'd die a little if she lied   And when in times of doubt   Have you ever tried to work it out   But still she leaves you wondering   What it's all about      And when she's far away   Have you ever felt the need to stray   And tried and then discovered   It just doesn't pay   'Cause with her, you can be true   And with her, you can be you   Have you ever been in love?.Seventeen, it's been a while since I was seventeen   And the years since have been mighty lean   But there's no use complaining      And forty-two has a way of creeping up on you   And my chances left are getting few   But there's still time remaining      And I've been waiting for someone, who loves the way I do   Girl I got my fingers crossed, in hopes it might be you      Seventeen, it's been a while since I was seventeen   And the years since have been mighty lean   But there's no use complaining      And forty-two has a way of creeping up on you   And my chances left are getting few   But there's still time remaining      And I've been waiting for someone, who loves the way I do   Girl I got my fingers crossed, in hopes it might be you      Twenty-one, that's how many different jobs I've done   I remember quitting every one   With no hesitating      And thirty-three, that's how many women left on me   I don't have too good a history   But I don't mind waiting      Cause it really doesn't matter how many years we've seen   Cause love is always seventeen      Wonder if you'll be the one to end this lonesome heart   Cause girl I got a lot to give and I'd sure like to start      Cause it really doesn't matter how many years we've seen   Cause love is always seventeen.[Chorus]      I talked to my baby, I talked to my baby..When they start to beat it out,   Everybody jumps and shouts,   Tell me who the critics all rave about,   Five guys named Moe..Chorus   Come with high regard from heavy metal country   They write you super-love and seal it with the kick   And now the creator's skull is cracked   Out come the underground with artificial love   They're singing loud, so very proud   To show the mess they made   At Zoo Arcade   When something central took away their guns      Sometimes I'm programmed better than the other ones   Sometimes I'm programmed to shoot the shot around the world   Sometimes I'm programmed      Chorus.One of them cowboys he starsts to draw,   And I shot him down Lord, He never saw,   Shot me another, Right then he hit the floor,   In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,   And we hightailed it down to Mexico..So, how do I tell her, tell her goodbye?"
"There was a time I was patient for a whole day! It was @CAPS1 eve and it was about @NUM1, meaning I just woke up, I ate breakfast brush my teeth after I got out of the shower. By now I would have probably ask my mom @NUM2 times if I could open one present, but on this day I hadn’@CAPS6 ask he once yet. I was up string playing my play station when my mom called up @CAPS2!!!! I open my door and as usual my cat was right at my door I shut my door hop over my cat get to the stairs then yell food. He sewried down the stairs and right to the canter. As I start walking down the stairs I hear a @CAPS3!! So I start running down the stairs as fast as I could knowing my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They meet @CAPS7 at the counter and ask @CAPS7. “@CAPS4 many times have you ask to open a present?” “@CAPS5” I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2 about @NUM5 minutes later I was done watch @CAPS6.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day..Chorus:   I'm so satisfied   I'm so satisfied   Man don't you understand your love   Made me smile again   And I'm so satisfied      Oh there are those who want the world   While those who have it want to throw it away   But of all the things there are, love's the most important   So believe me baby when I say      Chorus:   I'm so satisfied   I'm so satisfied   Man don't you understand your love   Made me smile again   And I'm so satisfied.Bitch!.Oh, faithless heart   You tempt me to the core,   But you can't have a hold on me   So don't come around anymore..I see you nearly everyday..I love all about you, but you don't know who I am   Sure is a complicated situation   So what if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming I am your man   And we wake up in a real life conversation...

"I showed patience before. I am about to tell you and that time. Two years ago.  I worked at my @CAPS1’s home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ???  he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1 that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing. “I know but you deserve it.” I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off..I don't give a damn..Fuck that!.Holy roller, lookin' down   Where you think you know   All the answers   Arrogance and pride....are sin   Better look to your, own chances      [Chorus]   Holy roller can you save your own soul   Can you save your own soul   Holy roller      Standin', up for jesus   That's your thing   But you're standin' on peoples hearts   Charity is a virtue   To be praised   Better get back on...Jesus' track      [Chorus]      Holy roller, practice what you preach   Heaven, it's still within your reach      Holy roller, don't you judge   What you think is goin' wrong      [Chorus: x2].To live between a rock and a hard place   In between time   Cruising in prime time   Soaking up the cathode rays      To live between the wars in our time   Living in real time   Holding the good time   Holding on to yesterdays      [Chorus:]   You know how that rabbit feels   Going under your speeding wheels   Bright images flashing by   Like windshields towards a fly   Frozen in the fatal climb   But the wheels of time   Just pass you by   Wheels can take you around   Wheels can cut you down      We can go from boom to bust   From dreams to a bowl of dust   We can fall from rockets' red glare   Down to ""Brother can you spare...""

"Middleton middle school, I’m one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, I’m new here, but you @MONTH1 think that I’m a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 I’m not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1’s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 said. “my name’s @CAPS4.” @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. “@CAPS2.” I said back. “I’m @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.” “@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1.” @CAPS4 replied. “@CAPS11 let me show you around.” “@CAPS12!” I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boy’s name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just woulden’t let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, “@CAPS13’s @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.” “@CAPS15?” @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 coulden’t do same thing. “@CAPS16 you just don’t have any patience!” I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 coulden’t understand. “@CAPS17 be that way  @CAPS1!” @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. “@CAPS4 wait!” I cried but I hat to run after her. “@CAPS20, please you don’t get @CAPS13. You can’t keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before?” I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. “@CAPS21.” @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again..I see that T-Bone got an automobile,   Low-loping and open to the sky..If you feel like rockin' now, baby, come on   Cause I feel like rockin', baby, all night long   I got my eyes on you, baby, cause you look so good   If you feel like dancin', baby, I wish you would   Come on and rock it with me, baby   Come on and shake it with me, baby   Well, I'm callin' everybody in the neighborhood   We got to get together cause it's gonna be good   If you feel like rockin', then baby come on   Baby, we can rock it all night long   Come on and rock it with me, baby   Come on and shake it with me, baby   If you feel like dancin', baby, I wish you would   I got my eyes on you, baby, cause you dance so good   If you feel like rockin', then baby come on   Baby, we can rock it all night long   Come on and rock it with me, baby   Come on and shake it with me, baby   Come on and rock it with me, baby   Come on and shake it with me, baby   Come on and move it with me, honey   Come on and help me spend my money   If you feel like rockin', then baby come on   Baby, we can rock it all night long   Come on and rock it with me, baby   Come on and shake it with me, baby   A little bit of rockin' makes everything right   We're gonna rock it, baby   Rock it tonight   Come on and rock it with me, baby   Come on and shake it with me, baby   Come on and move it with me, baby   Come on and groove it with me, baby   If you feel like rockin', then baby come on   Baby, we can rock it all night long   If you feel like rockin', then baby come on   Baby, we can rock it all night long   If you feel like rockin', then baby come on   Baby, we can rock it all night long.Start!.Yes, I understand that every life must end, aw huh,   As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, aw huh,   Yeah, I'm a lucky man to count on both hands   The ones I love      Some folks they have one yeah   Others they got none, aw huh      Stay with me   Let's just breathe      Practiced are my sins   Never gonna let me win, aw huh,   Under everything, just another human being, aw huh,   Yeah, I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world   To make me bleed      Stay with me   You're all I see      Did I say that I need you?.Righteous!.I keep seeing things I should not see   I've been watching you, are you using me?.Remember God's goodness,   O thou man, O thou man!.?.I kissed her and she kissed me   Like the fella once said,   ""Ain't that a kick in the head?"".I'm beggin' to you baby please..Lights, lights,   Sights, sights..Angels   Angels"
"I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1’s gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said “@CAPS6’re leaking trannie fluid.” @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). “@CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip” I said to @CAPS2, “@CAPS6 don’t know that for sure” he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didn’t help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 weren’t sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said “were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car..What does it mean?.You think of something!.When you left, the door was   (slamming)   You paused in the doorway   (slamming)   As though a thought stole you away   (slamming)   I watched the world pull you away   (Lock it)      So I run into the hall   (Lock it)   Into the corridor   (Lock it)   There's a door in the house   (slamming)   I hear the lift descending   (slamming)   I hear it hit the landing   (slamming)   See the hackles on the cat   (standing)      With my key I   (lock it)   With my key I   (lock it up)   With my key I   (lock it)   With my key I   (lock it up)      I am the concierge chez-moi, honey   Won't let ya in for love, nor money   (""Let me in!"").DJ (Get yourself some Oprah cash)   Is that what makes a star?.There's a restless feelin' in my bones an' I know,   That at times, it just won't go away..She wanted to take it further,   So she arranged a place to go,   To see if he   Would fall for her incognito..Yes I've brought the apples..Two hearts, two bucket seats, too much sun not to wear shades..So high   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   I fantasized about this back in Chicago   Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago   That's me, the first year that I blow   How you say broke in Spanish?.It's not...yesterday...anymore   I go visiting, I talk loud   I try to make myself clear   In front...of a face...that's nearer   Than it's ever been before   Not this close before   Nearer than before   Not this close before      It is...is a million...years ago   I hear music...and it sounds like bells   I feel like my head is high   I wish...I could meet...every one   Meet them all over again   Bring them up to my room   Meet them all over again   Everyone's up in my room      And now...now I'm busy...busy again   I feel like sitting down but   I'm still thinking...thinking about my friends   In my garden...moments   But now I'm speaking out   Speaking about my friends   Now I'm speaking out   Thinking about my friends.I want to go fishing and swimming   Looking at the pretty girls on the beaches, son   I don't want to do no work.He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey."
"Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m deticated, I’ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I’ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!.She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo..I could've sworn a ?.Her painted toes on the dash,   Her hand on my knee   She ain't looking out the window   Cause she's too busy lookin' at me   Yeah      Listen to the Goodyear's roll   Hummin' through the radio   Let it lighten up your load   Ain't got no place to go..Lifetime lived in such a dream,   Floats like a feather to the ground..badge of honor?.The only one      I think of you   And wonder who   You are and what's your line   I wonder if   There's someone else   Or if it's true that I'm   The only one   In your life   I only worry   For your own sake   I don't know much about   The deals you make   There's so much that   You hide from me   The mystery:   Am I the only one?.Carolina queen,   She's a walking love machine..The future is still way off..Climb over the mountains, there you'll find warm winds blowing..A little country church on a two lane road   A bride and groom coming out the door   White lace dress and a red bouquet   Just married written on a blue Chevrolet      Don't that make you want to fall in love   Don't that look like a picture of us   A match made in heaven if there ever was   Don't that make you want to fall   That just makes me want to give you my heart   Ever forever needs a place to start   Gotta be a sign from up above   Don't that make you want to fall in love      Old folks sittin' in a front porch swing   Still holdin' hands like they were sixteen   Fifty good years they're a lover's dream   Darlin' that could be you and me      Don't that make you want to fall in love   Don't that look like a picture of us   A match made in heaven if there ever was   Don't that make you want to fall   That just makes me want to give you my heart   Ever forever needs a place to start   Gotta be a sign from up above   Don't that make you want to fall in love   Yeah, yeah..The warden threw a party in the county jail..Two blooms for a penny."
"I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my for-wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home exept for my grandma, my dad don’t want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not their. At that point I was inpatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. So I called my dad and he said it was @CAPS1 if my uncle @PERSON1 said it was fine with him. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore..Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare..Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed   Or they'll never know what love can do..Do you have a heart?.The more that you see,   The less that you know..So don't you go and say goodbye,   You can lay your worries down and stay with me..Shouting and cursing at someone who clearly isn't around..But you could bring back mem'ries, departed,   By playing my baby's request..(Hough!).Spent all my time, learnt a killer's art..Whose seen the wind not you or I,   But when the ship moves she's passing by..And we go to the stars..In the ulcerating silence, perspective comes   The way it always does, for it's ransom   So randomly, somebody calls   The phone rings and it brings Niagara Falls   At 3 o'clock in the morning   You'd better be dyin', you were   So we talked about time and where it went   Unremarkable events and how   One day took two days and they got spent   How you'd continue   Carefully in degrees   Trying to do one true beautiful thing   And your beautiful thing   It'd be a beautiful thing   To see that beautiful thing continuing   I don't live there, I just commute   Secretly cradling a joint, I might puke   Fumble with the keys, under duress   The point is, this is, practice duress   3 o'clock in the morning   You'd better be dying' and you were   So we talked about things and where they went   Big remarkable events and how   Each day's a new day and they get spent   How you'd continue, artfully, like the breeze   Trying to do one true beautiful thing   Your beautiful thing   It'd be a beautiful thing to see   That beautiful thing continuing   Your beautiful thing continuing   Your beautiful thing will be   A beautiful thing to me   A beautiful thing continuing   Your beautiful thing continuing"

"“When do ve get the xbox!” I asked @CAPS1. “@CAPS2 hours,” he replied. “@CAPS3!” “yes.” “@CAPS4.” “@CAPS4.” @CAPS2 hours…. I thought, this is gonna feel like a week. First, I got on the computer. After ten minutes I got off because nothing was ???. Next I looked at the t.v guide. Nothing. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I did…, I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide still nothing. I just turned the t.v on. A @PERSON1 just ended. “@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1,” the @CAPS8 commercial said. “@CAPS10 see this,” I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought. It was a no color @PERSON1 that was about a police official and his son. After watching four hours of the @PERSON1, I heard the goings door open. I heard @CAPS1 come in and say, “@CAPS12 got it!” @CAPS13 then I said, “@CAPS14,” and then fell asleep. “@CAPS15 wake him up.” @CAPS1 whispered..What was written foretold in dreams,   In visions apocalypse now seen..see What Up?.Goes the weasel..Come stare al ristorante   Se non hai niente da dire e vabb?.We would shit a brick the size of all of it      What if?.There was a time when girls were kind   When their voices were soft   And their words inviting   There was a time when love was blind      And the world was a song   And the song was exciting   There was a time   It all went wrong      I dreamed a dream of time gone by   When hope was high   And life worth living   I dreamed that love would never die   I dreamed that God would be forgiving      When I was young and unafraid   When dreams were made   And used and wasted   There was no ransom to be paid      No song unsung, no wine un-tasted   But the tigers come at night   With their voices soft as thunder   And they tear your hope apart      As they turn your dream to shame....   She slept this summer by my side   She filled my days with endless wonder   She took my childhood in her stride      But she was gone when autumn came   And still I dream she'll come to me   That we will spend the years together   But there are dreams that cannot be      And there are storms we cannot weather   I had a dream my life would be   So different from this hell I'm living   So different now from what it seemed   But life can't kill   The dream I dreamed.I learned to rely on myself   And I thought that I was doin' well   Until you came with something   I just can't deny..Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?.Hey drink up all you people   Order anything you see   And have fun you happy people   The laugh and the drinks on me      Try to think that love's not around   Still it's uncomfortably near   My poor old heart ain't gaining any ground   Because my angel eyes ain't here      Angel eyes, that old Devil sent   They glow unbearably bright   Need I say that my love's misspent   Misspent with angel eyes tonight      So drink up all of you people   Order anything you see   And have fun you happy people   The drink and the laughs on me      Pardon me but I got to run   The fact's uncommonly clear   I got to find who's now the number one   And why my angel eyes ain't here      Excuse me while I disappear.Cause I've never been this close before, to someone who didn't run and hide..You're loud and clear but I don't understand   I'm a digital explorer in analog roam   And everybody's on the phone      Do you remember dialing up?.Come home, come home   Ye who are weary, come home   Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling   Calling, Oh sinners come home."

" I was patient when I was going to cedar point. We took a bas it took seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided in watch movies on the @CAPS2. We watched street dreams and the incredible. We were still a long way from cedar point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilerious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait now longer. This helped in my future..Don't tell me that talk is cheap,   When it's clear as my nose that it's not..As I cruise along the highway..raised me and Hollywood is crazy      [Chorus: x2].I saw there, images   Projected on a wall of stone..Was I shy?.Dirty money scheme, a clean split,   Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy..Maybe someday you'll have woke up,   And, barely conscious, you'll say to no one:   ""Isn't something missing?"".The wind outside is frightening,   but it's kinder than the lightning life in the city..Starting today, starting today   Girl, I'm starting today..   You're tired of playing the kiss and make up game   And I apologize for the man I became   If I could do it all again, I wouldn't hurt my best friend   And I'd throw away all my selfish ways I'm sorry, I know you're mad   And I don't wanna be like every other man that you've had   So I'm stopping all these childish things, girl, you mean too much to me   Your love is worth too much to lose   Girl, I know I broke your heart and trusting me is really hard   But watch how quick I change my ways...Everybody live for the music-go-round..In Another Woeld   Someone Over There Is Counting..I am thirsty for my sleep   There are no answers anyway."
"A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading.

the hill   Only inches from the edge   Where she's almost falling   Stares at the sky till she's drowning in the rain      Nice dress, nice smile   What a wonderful child   If they knew all the lies she's told them   It's too complicated for her to explain      She prays to the heavens to try to save her soul   Cause the sweet little angel is close to letting go      [Chorus]      I pray to the

"Patience is the key to life some say. I don’t really know if it is or not. Patience is when your quite, you can wait for things. It is when you can do hardstuff with out feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties. Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. Patience does not lie, it makes things better when they are difficulty. It makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things..Because they want to be down with the   Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command   I supply the concept for you to understand   For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss   The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus   Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me   You wish that one day you could have this   Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme   And get up on the wrath of my madness   (Extended ragga outro).Heh heh heh heh   Now listen to me      I'm burnin', burnin', I got the fever   I know for sure, there ain't no cure   So feel it, don't fight it, go with the flow   Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme one more for the road      What do you want?.Let me wrap myself around you   You'll show me how I see it   And when you come back in from nowhere   Do you ever think of me?.It's a bald kinda girl   With a pointed head   Oh no....Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man   Don't sit around gossiping, explaining what your good man really can do   Some women nowadays, Lord they ain't no good   They will laugh in your face, Then try to steal your man from you   Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man   Your best girlfriend, she might be a highbrow, she changes clothes 3 times a day   What do you think she's doing now, while you're so far away   She's loving your man in your own damn bed   You better call for the doctor, mama, try to investigate your head   Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man   Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man   Don't sit around, girl, telling all your secrets,   Telling all those good things he really can do   If you talk about your baby, you tell me he's so fine   Lord honey, I just might sneek up and try to make him mine   Women be wise, keep your mouth shut, don't advertise your man   Don't be no fool, don't advertise your man (baby don't do it).Chorus   Gimme gimme cha cha heels..With their humorless smiles so easy to see through   Can they tell you what's wrong from right?.Baby you haven't been getting along with me   If you play the song, I know whether to stay or cry or leave      In the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you   In the second I love you but you leave   In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free   On the fourth, someone else is loving me, loving me      Baby I'm waiting to hear your song for me   Cuz there's been delays since I asked if you're in love with me   And baby the songs you write are not happy   I can't find a line like ""I love you"" and ""you love me""   Baby I no longer think you belong to me   So I got the song, but you lost the girl, goodbye from me      In the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you   In the second I love you but you leave   In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free   On the fourth, someone else is loving me, loving me      Baby I'm worried you'll get it wrong for me   There's four love songs, so which one did you write for me?.The more I know, more I know, more I know,   More I feel, the weight of the world!!!.I can remember when this was the future   Where it was gonna be at back then   Why don't we turn the whole bloody lot down   And make a new start all over again?.Did you know the circus was in town?.(Little lamb went down)      One little lamb, little lamb came down to the water   I asked him about my friend Jacob   Wanted to know how things are going   Is that love still showing?"

"I awoke at the sound of the alarm clock on a sort @PERSON1. It was @NUM1 my mom was on time prepare ???. I was in a hurry to get going. Today was the day that the x-box @NUM2 came out and I wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running arch I could get it. As an hour past we arrived at the grcery state. I darted inside and grabbed a cart. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any ginks of being impatient. After what see made like hours we were done and the next stop was the library. I couldn’t do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quickly. It was already dark when we finally went to best buy to buy the x-box @NUM2. We went and got it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day..You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top..He's either filled up with music   Or locked in his shell again..Well, by this time   I was a-scared to knock,   I was a-scared to move,   I's in a state of shock..Yes, that's just like a woman   Ain't that just like a woman?.It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels   As you said in the words of your song..[Chorus:]      Ain't no other man, can stand up next to you   Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do   (What you do)..before you   Yeah the sea is fascination man and everything's for free   The sea is fascination man and everything's for free   Until you wind up in some bathroom overdosed and on your knees   (chorus)   give it up -- turn before you   give it up -- turn before you   give it up -- turn before you   give it up -- turn before you   give it up -- turn before you   give it up -- turn before you.Gaston      Then we..Want me to marry - get a home - settle down - write a book!.(Hogarthkellymosleyrotherytrewavas)   Absence makes the heart go mad   All the solid things become mirages   The certain things   Sand running in the hour glass   Running away   I scream along the ledge   As the windows back and close   I run around try to prove the sunrise   I believe in belief   But it's proof I need   Can you show me it's me   Can you show me it's me   Travelling makes the mind go vague   All the special faces fade away   Spinning like a heat haze   Shimmering   Please send Polaroids   Or an ear in the post   A map to the treasure   A key to the closed   I need you like hell   Can you help me again   Can you show me it's me   Can you show me it's me   I run dry   I run out   I run cold   I need help   Trying to prove the sunrise   Trying to prove the tides   Trying to prove the blue moon sky   And is it you?.Oh, lost in the night in a town without pity,   You learn how to cry, you learn how to cry..She's comin'!"
"One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didn’t see anything but we weren’t going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn’t hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie..All I can do is keep breathing [Repeat: x5]      All we can do is keep breathing [Repeat: x5]   Now.I guess you should've seen it coming   We've both made mistakes back then   But ever since we've been together   I've learned from all of them   We'll always be together   Yeah, no matter what!.Our Father,   Deliver us.Oh, I don't what made me,   What gave me the right,   To mess with your values,   And change wrong to right..You know I got this feeling that I just can't hide   I try to tell you how I feel   I try to tell you but I'm me   Words don't come easily   When you get close I share them      I watch you when you smile   I watch you when you cry   And I still don't understand   I can't find the way to tell you      [Chorus:]   I wish I was your lover   I wish that you were mine   Baby I got this feeling   That I just can't hide      Don't try to run away   There's many things I wanna say   No matter how it ends   Just hold me when I tell you      [Chorus x2]      Oh I need is a miracle   Oh baby all I need is you   All I need is a love you give   Oh baby all I need is you   Baby you      [Chorus x3]      Just wanna be your lover   Just wanna be the one   Let me be the lover   Let me be the one   Yeah yeah.We are children of paradise   When the Lord created us   All his work was through      Then the children of paradise   Did the only thing they really shouldn't do      Children of paradise   We started out there   Full of innocence in our eyes   And without a care      We are children of paradise   We knew of no crime   Until one of the meanest lies   Has changed our time      It was long ago   In the early morning glow   When it all began with Adam and Eve   They were young and free   And for all eternity   They were meant to feel   No trouble no grief      Children of paradise      We're the children of paradise   In search of the light      That was put in paradise   And started the night      It was long ago      We are children of paradise      We are the children of paradise   Who didn't obey   When we followed the wrong advise   We wandered astray   We are the children of paradise   In search of the light      It was long ago.Respect me baby and I'll respect you,   What more can two lovers do?.You all about yo' money and got something to sell   But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell..Sometimes,   Gotta try,   Run and hide,   Get away from this..My minds a time machine, I'm in the future and the past..What the fuck is that   Ha ha ha ha.(Face to Face!)"
"There goes another @NUM1 minutes wasted! I knew I should of got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @CAPS1 for food? Three days ago, l though that l should stop at my locker before going to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, @CAPS6 the food was at! I reached out and - wait @CAPS6's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza enticed my sense and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, ""@CAPS6 is the food?"" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. I bailed to the other line. I gripped tongs with disappointment and put chips and cheese on my plate. At least l had some food! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience ."" l got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometime you @MONTH1 get rewarded!.Every other city we go   We always pull a couple of pretty hoes   Send 'em back to the room and get it on!.He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh..Hello, God?.That I really don't have to carry the cross..Twinkling lights   A chill is in the air   And carols everywhere   Close your eyes, it's almost here   Candles and cards   And favorite movie scenes   The smell of evergreen   As special as it's always been   And I have a dream or two   Maybe they will come true      [Chorus:]   Setting our hopes on a big snow tonight   We'll wake up to a world of white   It's gonna be a christmas to remember   Light up the fire, play some Nat King Cole   Always sentimental and don't you know that   It's gonna be a Christmas to remember      I know it's true   Time doesn't stand still   Many things can change   But we know some things never will   The memories we share   The songs we always sing   The mystery of life   The hopefulness this season brings   And I have a dream or two   Maybe they will come true      [Chorus:].Can't nothin' come about, we'll take it slow..Inviting contradiction?.why want me to believe the word's you read   But I don't believe in what your good book says,   I just believe that when I'm dead, I'm dead..Just sit the fuck down bitch!.Why not?.Beware of them!.We want you to know."
"A time were I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I got my broken foot. I was waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on.

"One day not @CAPS1 very long ago, my brother @PERSON1, had homework troubles. And yes @CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I had said “on what.” @CAPS1 he said “@CAPS2 math homework its just too long and I can’t do it.” @CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. @CAPS1 I helped him. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper..I'm carrying a torch for you   I'm carrying a torch   You know how much it costs   To keep carrying a torch      Flame of love it burens so bright   That is my desire   Keep on liftin' me, liftin' me up   Higher and higher      You're the keeper of the flame   Girl, you burn so bright   Baby, why don't we reconnect?.We're looking for answers in outer space   When will we discover the earth is a sacred place?.Makes a treat each week, tomorrow sits at home..Tell me what can I do?.The shattered fortress, fly now, be free!.If you go get shot   When you'll be what you name   Protector of your gun   Everyone plays with your gun      Way, way, way, way   Everyone wants to try to gun you gun you down in pain   Want to see you try to play   I want to describe you   Put your name as a national woman   I don't like your coffee   I want to have your friendship   As a jock, and to the top      Way, way, way, way.Unfortunate son cornered,   Cowering in the pit of   Circling panes of glass that   Surround and reveal the ever present ""It""..I've got a pair of Gohills boots   But I got fading roots..She pulled down the staps to her dress   Reached in the ?.the long lost queen's of some hoodoo?.- Just like this, U get a kiss   (Don't U wanna feel good?).Once a man, like the sea I raged,   Once a woman, like the earth I gave."
"Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn’t panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners..Don't be surprised   But this look in my eyes   Like a flower or tree   I will bloom in the spring   I will shed all my woes   As the green grass grows   Like a flower or tree   I will throw my head back and sing      If I were a desert flower, desert flower.Your reward will come      And the truth will come and the change will come   It's just a question of how and when   I can't believe my eyes..Don't I show you I do,   Just as you love me?.And just as soon as they find you   They'll wine you and dine you..He stands like a statue,   Becomes part of the machine..Conditioned to respond to all the threats   In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets..A Cosmopolitan, a Manhattan   Call me one   Pour a round for me and my friends   Cape Cod Sea Breeze, Long Island Ice Teas   I won't go there or drink it if you paid me      When they come to waylay me   When they close in for the capture   I did it all   I did it all   For the love and the laughter   I did it all   I did it all   I did it all      Slept in late   Stayed up for days   Partied hard   Lived my twenties in haze   Smoked second-hand in crowded bars   With the A-list of B-list movie stars      When they come to arrest me   Pat me down and undress me   I'll confess without miranda   Strike a pose for the tabloid cameras   I did it all   I did it all   I did it all      I did it all   I didn't ask permission   I did it all   What kind of life   Is not an exhibition   I did it all   Crash and burn   And then you know you're living   I did it all   Some pain a few tears after   I did it all   To the last line of the final chapter   I did it all   I did it all      My heat is a wound that festers   Seduced my share in silk and polyester   Oh my great loves   And my few losses   I'll tell it all   When my little black book is published      When they come to interview me   For my made for TV movie   Say I'm the bitch who was a bastard   Who did it all for the love and laughter   I did it all   I did it all   I did it all.And I'm trying to get somewhere   In a room with glow   The church mice are singing now   What John Lee Hooker knows   Godhead   We got nothing   We got everything   I'm falling backwards in her mirrored room   In her mirrored room tonight   She looks so good   And I feel fine   As she says we might make it to Godhead.They took a clean-cut kid   And they made a killer out of him   That's what they did..""Kill the rockstars"" how ironic, Kathleen   You've been crowned the newest queen   Kinda like the punk rock Gloria Steinham   You can't change the world by blaming men   Can't change the world by hating men      Just cause I don't know the reason you're so pissed   Don't dare tag me misogynist   I thought the goal here was mutual respect   Not constructing a separate sect   I wish I could have seen Courtney   Demonstrate some real mysoginy   Can't change the world by hating men.I know my rights I'm allowed to die   So I'd rather swap your different guise      It's in my head if you will find   Mother love from all mankind   You look above and then you shout   No other way to say your head is alright      Feeling psyched to be walking   I wonder why   All my joys could be open   No more cries      I'm feeling psyched to be walking   I wonder why   All my joys could be open   No more cries.Seems I've been running all my life, all my life."

"What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient..I coulda been most anything I put my mind to be,   But a cowboy's life was the only life for me..In the still of the night   I hear the wolf howl, honey   Sniffing around your door   In the still of the night   I feel my heart beating heavy   Telling me I gotta have more      In the shadow of night   I see the full moon rise   Telling me what's in store,   My heart start aching   My body start a shaking   And I can't take no more, no, no      Now I just want to get close to you   An' taste your love so sweet   And I just want to make love to you   Feel your body heat      In the still of the night   In the still of the night   Over here baby      In the heat of the day   I hang my head down low   And hide my face from the sun   Through the light of the day   Until the evening time   I'm waiting for the night to come      In the still of the night,   In the cool moonlight,   I feel heart is aching   In the still of the night      Tell me here baby      In the still of the night   I hear the wolf howl, honey   Sniffing around your door   In the still of the night   I feel my heart beating heavy   Telling me I gotta have more..When the day that lies ahead of me   Seems impossible to face   When someone else instead of me   Always seems to know the way      Then I look at you   And the world's alright with me   Just one look at you   And I know it's gonna be   A lovely day....Well, you've got me floatin' around and 'round   Always up, you never let me down   The amazing thing: you turned me on nat'rally   Oh and I kiss you when I please..Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone   Boop-boo-ba-doo-ba-doop!.This'll hurt you worse than me   I'm weak, seven days, I'm weak   Don't run from me I won't   Bother counting one, two, three      I don't know which me that I love   Got no reflection   I don't know which me that I love   Got no reflection      Show myself how to make a noose   A gun's cliche, and a razor too   I'm not a death share vacation, vacant station   Made of scars and filled with my old wounds      This'll hurt you worse than me   I'm weak, seven days, I'm weak   Don't run from me I won't   Bother counting one, two, three      I don't know which me that I love   Got no reflection   I don't know which me that I love   Got no reflection      You, you don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you   You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you   You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you   You don't even want to know what I'm gonna do to you      I don't know which me that I love   Got no reflection   I don't know which me that I love   Got no reflection      No Reflection   No Reflection      I've got no reflection.Arthur:   You better not   Motorhead:   I took it..Yeah, yeah..Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!.But it did.Heaven only knows[x5]      Last night was the worst night   Beginning of the end   Or maybe it began   Before it here we go again   Things got so dramatic   Things got out of hand   We said words we couldn't imagine   I don't understand      There you go with the same old thing   When things go wrong, you always seem to blame me   Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind   Where the end will go   Will I ever know?.Little cheeks   Little teeth   Everything around me is little   If I wring   Little necks   Surely I will get an acquittal      Some women are dripping with diamonds   Some women are dripping with pearls   Lucky me!"

" My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors. It was a long day. At first we went in and it it took a hour just for her to get in. and she finally did get in and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I would see people come in and then go out. I see about @NUM1 people do that. I sat and read magazines why I was waiting she finally came out. When she was the day was pretty much over with then. And that was a very patient day..(all night)   All night long!.Will you play with me?.You only get lies and pain and sorrow   So far at least until tomorrow   I'll never fall in love again   I'll never fall in love again.Down into the dark I go, armed with just a candle and then my soul   Cryptic messages written on the floor   Rats are nibbling at my feet, I send one off to nevermore   Too much darkness, spiders on my eyes      Webs are hanging from my thighs, the fatter ones must die   I see shadows walking straight and tall   I don't know how they move, dancing on the walls   Presence of fear, a presence so near      I wonder what could be so powerful beyond the dark   Human bones... in little chambers all along the narrow halls   Catacomb, death over life... Catacomb, am I here to die?.So I'm ....You are not innocent..I see trouble on the way..(Away in the manger no crib for a bed   The little Lord Jesus layed down His sweet head...).When everybody else refrains   My uncle Jonny did cocaine   He's convinced himself right in his brain   That it helps to take away the pain   Hey, Jonny   Hey, what you say, Jonny?.(It's alright)   Baby how could you be so mean?.Yeah now, meet me in the bottom,   Bring me my running shoes..I'm outta the dive an' comin' alive."
" Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect.

"A  time   when   I  was  patient  was when  I  went  to  the  doctors. When  I  went  to  the  doctors  for  a  checkup, my  appointment  was  at  @TIME1 and  we  didn’t  get  called  till @NUM1.  I had to wait a long time! Finally  when  we  got into the  doctors room  the  nurse  did my blood pressure and then  I  had  to  wait  another  @NUM2 mins  for  the  actuall  doctor. By the time the doctor   actually came it was about @NUM3.  I  got  my  flue  shot  and  the  swine  flue  shot.  When  I  was  all done  it  was  @NUM4  I was  ready  to  go  home.

"This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I’m empty on the inside, i goess. There’s gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He’s always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He’s useless now, but I’m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it’s not just @CAPS2 who I’m waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he’d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn’t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. He’s gone hasn’t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. I’m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I’m still waiting for a hello..She's a Teaser Japanese..If I don't seem focused   Maybe not quite right..Girl, I've been waitin' all night to see you dance like me   You gon' sweat your outfit, out trying to dance like me   (Now let me see)   Ah ah ah, freeze!.Halloween!.Don't bring me down, Grroosss   Don't bring me down, Grroosss   Don't bring me down, Grroosss   Don't bring me down..I'm soaring the sky   I can hear the birds and man they don't lie   How you gonna catch me, when I'm this high      I'm moving on   I got the words to a brand new song   How you gonna catch me, when I'm this close      Chorus:   Gone tomorrow here today   Just in case you got somethin' to say   I'll be leaving with the breast of   Goodbye is all we have      I disconnected the phone   Told the neighbors I'll be heading home   As soon as the light hits the morn      I'm heading north   Gonna see what this heart's really worth   I guess it's time to be on my own      (Chorus)      I sure would love to see you tonight   Maybe try to end this fight   If I don't hear you knockin' on my door   Then I'll know for sure      (Chorus).Tread on my face if you like little lady   Turn me inside out if you have to baby   But don't you cross me off your list   I am young and I ain't never been kissed   Never been kissed by a lady called Amy      You're far out, you're fab and insane   A woman of the world, it's quite plain   My dad told me Amy's your name   Said he'd break my neck if I played your game   But he can bust my neck 'cause I love you all the same      Amy I know you don't have to show your affection   Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection   So if you don't want me around   I think I'll run along and drown   You can't want this bum in town Amy      I'm beaten on the streets 'cause I loves you   I watch you go to work in the summer   I don't whistle at you down the street   I would if I could but I can't whistle you see      Amy I may not be James Dean   Amy I may not be nineteen   And I may still be in romper boots and jeans   But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams.Oh I've been there..I've been waiting so long      And this love, fool, osophy   Is killing previous illusions that I had in my mind   About you seems so true   All the lies your telling tragically compelling   And my love means nothing to you so   Maybe I'm still a love fool   I don't want to be a love fool   I don't want the world   I want you!.[Chorus]   C'mon girl(let's go)   Let's get it right(let's go)   Let's get it right(let's go)   Let's get it right(let's go)   (x4)      The spirit of a dragon's tear   Is lovely at this time of year   The cave within your mountainside   Is deeper than it will be wide   Hold me      My disenchanted diplomat   Asleep inside the laundromat   Conveyor belts are moving   And I want you to be sure of that   Tell me      And if you let it germinate   I know it will be worth the wait   Disputed by the news that it was   You who tried to instigate      [Chorus]      Blessed are the hypocrites   Outwitted but she never quits   The trouble with the band of slits   Is washing off the muddy bits   Hey, yeah!.It's been told form the beginning   The Lord your God is on your side      O my soul don't be afraid   Hope in the Lord   By His righteousness and power   He will strengthen   He will guide      Chorus:   And I will soar   On wings like eagles   Held by the hand of God   I will run and not grow tired   When on His name I call      For the Lord is never weary   His ways are beyond my thoughts   I will trust in Him   With all my heart   (Repeat verses and Chorus)      And I will rest upon His promise   Patiently I'll wait...   (Repeat Chorus 2 times)      I will trust in Him   With all my heart      And I will rest upon His promise   Patiently I'll wait....It was later than I thought, when I first believed you,   Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools."
" Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 it now not later. You must stay calm and be pieceful in patience that they almost forgot what they are whating for but I always @CAPS1 it now too. I can't stand not having something. If theres a test on @DATE1 .I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't what that long and it gives my tension just knowing whats going to happen.

"Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your ??? because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the “aliens”. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesn’t cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, “I tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself..?.I must be crazy now   Maybe I dream too much   But when I think of you   I long to feel your touch      To whisper in your ear   Words that are old as time   Words only you would hear   If only you were mine      I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you   Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes   'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do   And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side      I love you, please say   You love me too, these three words   They could change our lives forever   And I promise you that we will always be together   Till the end of time      So today, I finally find the courage deep inside   Just to walk right up to your door   But my body can't move when I finally get to it   Just like a thousand times before      Then without a word he handed me this letter   Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said   I love you, please say   You love me too, these three words   They could change our lives forever   And I promise you that we will always be together   Till the end of time      Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah   And maybe I, I need a little care   And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you   Oh you need somebody just to hold you   If you do, just reach out and I'll be there      I love you, please say   You love me too   Please say you love me too   Till the end of time   These three words   They could change our lives forever   And I promise you that we will always be together      Oh, I love you   Please say you love me too   Please please   Say you love me too   Till the end of time   My baby   Together, together, forever   Till the end of time   I love you   I will be your light   Shining bright   Shining through your eyes   My baby.We don't want no killing Lord   I don't want to see my brother die   We don't want no killing Lord   I don't want to to see my sister cry   I don't want to see   I don't want to see I I I I I   I know that bad things are going down   I, I know that loneliness is all around   I know that the world is starved for love   Love   Why know that there's good   And there's evil   And there's evil   Disguised as good   They're knocking at my door   They're knocking at my door   Don't let them in   Don't let them in   I think it's the Milwaukee Police   I think it's the police   I think it's the polizei   I think it's the polizei I I I   Everyday everyday everyday everyday   I need your love love   And it's a bad bad score   And I need you all the more   I need your love   Love.Graceless lady, you know who I am..To be an immortal, one must not devour   To be an immortal, we gotta know what's right   To be an immortal, we must hide our power   To be an immortal, we gotta use our might      It's the time to flutter and go fly   We can do whatever,   We will not lie   Our faces never break a tear   Cause our smiles are coming from ear to ear   So...

"Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn’t care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn’t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I’m still alive, right? My friends don’t know me to have patience and I don’t either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again.

"There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1! It was a night more coming true. We got hungry. We really didn’t compliments. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were companing a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didn’t take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fum to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day.

"Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 was early @DATE1, the leaves just beginning to change colors and flutter down above your head. My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned..And you know even that failed   Now how can a walk fail, Ray?.[Nick:]   There you go caught you crashin' my dreams again   Just when I'm trying to get over you   I tell my heart but I can't seem to comprehend   A day without you      [AJ:]   Now you've carved out a life   But I wear the scars   Reminding me by the hour   That it's time to accept that's the way the things are   I wish I could but      [Chorus:]   I can't imagine it any other way   A world without you is only wasted space   You're gone and I'll always wonder   Why it can't be any other way   Any other way      [Brian:]   Since you drained all the color out of the sky   How am I supposed to feel?.Transcribed by sam carle      Time and time again I've felt these wall's of plaster,   Closing in,   And more than once I've felt that lonely lonely feeling,   Wondering why and where I've been,   Just about the time, I think I can't hold on,   You're always there to keep me hanging on and I say,      I never knew how much a man needed a woman   (no I never)   I never knew how much a boy needed a girl   (needed a girl)   I never knew how much I needed you      Day after day I join the rat race,   Tryin' to make the most of it,   I keep on falling down down the ladder,   Still trying to stay on top of it,   Just when I was sure,   Nothing could get no better,   Oh I realize,   I still love you more than ever,      [Chorus:]      Today I watch the sun set on the freeway,   Strangled on the poison air,   But miles beyond, on the other end,   I know, you'll always be waiting there,   Girl you treat me,   With your kindest hand,   And in my heart, in my mind,   And I'm so glad      [Chorus:].Please return your love to me, girl   Forgive me for the wrong I've done      And, oh, baby   I cry myself to sleep at night   For fear of a-never holdin' you tight at all, baby (whoa, baby)   I miss ya more with each passin' day   Every night on my knees I pray   Oh, oh, baby (please)      Return your love to me, girl   Forgive me for the wrong I've done   Without your love, I'm just no good   For I am just a lonely boy      I'm sorry for the wrong I've done   Now I know how it feels to lose that special someone (whoa, baby)   I need you more than words can say   Without your love I can't face another day   Oh, (please)      Return your love to me, girl   Forgive me for the wrong I've done   Without your love, I'm just no good   I am just a lonely one      Oh, no, no-o-o-o, babe   If there's a heav'n above you'll be my one and only love (and, oh, baby)   I can't control the glow in me   Girl, come on and an' see about me      (Oh, ple-ea-ease)   Return your love to me, girl   Forgive me for the wrong I've done   Without your love, I'm just no good   I am just a lonely one      I'm a lonely one   I'm a lonely one   I'm a lonely one   I'm just a lonely... one...

" Patience is about waiting for some thing. Like we can say your new shoes will becoming in two weeks instead of paceing around worrying all the time. you just walk around like honnel. For example hunting you sit and wait for a deer to come. If your inpatient you would go look for some. Sometimes a lot of people can got inpatient about something and become mean. Being patient is understanding why it is taking a long time for something. You have to to herdteif it dont come the come the @DATE1 it supposed to. This one tim I had a @CAPS1 appointment at @TIME1 and my mom and I had to wait until five o'clock. And we never got mad just a little board. This one time a friend of mine was waiting for his dad didnt  come home until the @DATE1.When I would play my song   You used to sing along   I always seem to forget   How fragile are the very strong

  In two years or so   Drop me a line, write me a letter   I hope to find you're doing better   Better than today, better everyday   I'm sending you away tonight   I'll put you on a bird's strong wing   I'm saving you the best way I know how   I hope again one day to hear you sing   I'm saving you the only way that I know how   I hope again one day to hear you sing   I hope again one day to see you   Bring your smile back around again.And we struck up a conversation..How did I get here   I guess it doesn't really matter   I try and pass the days   Without you on my mind   Without you next to me

"Paitience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone or for something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but momdid not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said wait a little while be paitient.” I went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker.

"One time was the often best friend I had went to a ride it was so hot outside but the first ride we on was called the @CAPS1. The line was super long, it was like going  through a maze because how the rope were tied up we stood in the line for about forty five minutes but it felt like two hours . But I didn’t really complain about except for my friend she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large  feet were tired, but when we finally got there we stared rolling to know how .

"One time I had to be really patience. It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs..I'm shiny and I know it,   Don't know why you wanna blow it,   Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough..Well, I need one now      All the days of my life   All the days of my life   All the days I owe you      All I've done   I've done for me   All you gave   You gave for free   I gave nothing in return   And there's little left of me      All the days of my life   All the days of my life   All the days I owe you      In red-eyed pain I'm knocking on your door again   My crazy brain in tangles   Pleading for your gentle voice   Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart   I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul      All the days of my life   All the days of my life   All the days I owe you   All the days of my life   All the days of my life   All the days I owe you      All the days of my life   All the days of my life   All the days I owe you.I should've known you couldn't take it   You had to make it with another man   You know that's true, baby   And I can play that game if you can   It's been a long time since I've come here   To give you what you need   My roots are in Chicago   But I know where I wanna plant my seed   I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another   And you know that silver dollar, it would make me rich   Girl like you, easy pitch   But I miss you now you're gone   I'm coming home, girl, just to show you   What this man's been living for   A tip for you, don't be surprised, baby   When I come busting through that door   It's been a long time since I've been here   To give you what you need   My roots are in Chicago   But I know where I wanna plant my seed   I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another   And even though that silver dollar would make me rich   I wanna tell you that there is a hitch   Miss you know you're gone   And all I got left is my old guitar   I, I bet a silver dollar, you, you'd love another   Even though that silver dollar would make me rich   I wanna tell you that there is a hitch   Miss you know you're gone.I have a whole ocean of trouble,   And just a little, half pint of joy..That's how love works..Seems the rumors are about your team might move away   Now, me I'm sentimental   But I'm not one to cry      Say there Mr. Krinkle let's cruise the Bastard boat   Damn then sonsabitches with their gill-nets set afloat   I flip on my tele and I watch the waters die   C'mon Mr. Krinkle tell me why      Hey ho Mr. Krinkle have you heard the brand new sound   It's a cross between Jimi Hendrix   Bocephus, Cher and James Brown   It's called ""Heavy Hometown""   New Wave, cold-filtered, low-calorie dry   C'mon Mr. Krinkle tell me why.Make some improvement on the human race..You know, that man that's been cooking up that jive,   Selling it to these folks 'round town,   Makin 'em have them funny dreams..Well I ain't goin' down that big long lonesome road   Pretty baby don't you hear me talkin'   No I ain't goin' down that big road by myself   If I can't carrry you baby   I'm gonna get me someone else   Alright boys   Well the sun is gonna shine in my back door some   My back door some, my door someday   You know the sun is gonna shine in   My back door some day   That big wind is gonna come up and blow my blues away   Now if you don't want me baby   Now why don't you tell me   Now why don't you tell me, tell me so   If you don't want me baby why don't you tell me so   It ain't like I'm a woman who ain't got no place to go   Play it right now   Now what good is a bulldog, if he won't fuss or   He won't fuss or fight pretty baby   What good is a bulldog, if he won't fuss or fight..(Oh, oh, I'm falling for you!).I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it..They say animals don't worry   They think they know what's best   They're making a fool of us      They ought to be more careful   They're setting a bad example   They say animals don't worry   They're living on nuts and berries      They're setting a bad example   They ought to be more careful   You know animals are hairy?"

"I am going to tell a story in my own way. It was @DATE1. My sister was turning @NUM1 years old. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “You have wait”. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s @CAPS3 slow,” @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, “@CAPS4 up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. That’s my story I told in my own way..Verse 3:   What we had is dead and gone..It all ends up the same..You live on your hill so high and so lonely   You toss out your bread crumbs to those down below   They think you're a king, but, believe me, it's only   Because they're too blind to know      There once was a time when your money had meaning   Your diamonds had glitter, but now it's all gone   It poisoned your laughter and muffled your singing   You can't even see that it's wrong      [Chorus]   Your castle is dingy and dirty and dismal   Your carpets are faded, your walls are all gray   There's dust on your silver and cracks in your crystal   All your young servants have drifted away      So go back to your sadness, go back to your sorrow   And I'll make my bed on a hill 'neath the sky   And lay here a-listening till the sun comes tomorrow   Counting the tears that you cry      [Chorus].When there's no where, no where we can run to anymore      We can't afford to be innocent   Stand up and face the enemy   It's a do or die situation   We will be invincible      And with the power of conviction   There is no sacrifice   It's a do or die situation   We will be invincible      Yeah, yeah   Yeah, yeah      [Repeat: x2]   We can't afford to be innocent   Stand up and face the enemy   It's a do or die situation   We will be invincible.Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma,   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma,   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma,   Zuhm-ma zhum-ma-zhum-ma   Ma-ma-ma-ma ma-ma-ma-ma-ma      Oh, beautiful lana   I told it my mama   And my dad   What I had      Was the sweetest   And the neatest   Little girl   In the world      Oh la-la-la-la lana   La-la-la-la lana   Hey hey lana   He- he- hey      O- oh lana   Don't make me blue   O- oh lana   Don't you know   Don't you know   I love you      Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ling-a ling-a-ling-a   Ma-ma-ma-ma ma-ma-ma-ma-ma      Oh beautiful lana   Don't you know that I want to   Hug and kiss you   Let you know that I miss you   While we're apart   Oh my heart   All it can say is      L-a-n-a   L-a-n-a   L-a-n-a   L-a-n-a   Oh la-la-la-la lana   La-la-la-la-lana   Oh la-la-la-la lana   La-la-la-la lana   Hey hey lana   He- he- hey.There comes a time in every life,   We find the heart we're waiting for..Countless long nights   While I stare at the wall   I ask myself over again...

"Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it,  patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and @CAPS1 my patience was before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!”@CAPS1 your patience!”my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me..You can look but you'd better not touch   Poison Ivy, poison ivy   Measles make ya' mumpy,   And mumps'll make ya' lumpy   And chicken pox will make you jump and twitch   A common cold will fool ya'   And whooping coughs will cool ya'   But Poison Ivy,   Lord will make you itch   You're gonna need an ocean   Of calamine lotion,   Oh you're gonna need it   You'll be scratching like a hound, boy,   You'll be itchin'   The minute you start to mess around   Whoa But everybody knows, don't ya know, don't ya know?.I never really said it before      There's nothing here but flesh and bone   There's nothing more, nothing more   There's nothing more   Let's go outside   Dancing on the d-train baby      When the moon is high   And the grass is jumpin'   Come on, just keep on funkin'   Keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'.And back out on the road is where we like to be seated..Little Baby, pa rum pum pum pum   I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum   I have no gift to bring, pa rum pum pum pum   That's fit to give the King, pa rum pum pum pum,   Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum,      Shall I play for you, pa rum pum pum pum,   On my drum?.Please, father don't be angry with me..It's OK   Love is only meant for some   I'm the rock   The shoulder you can cry on   I keep the walls from falling down   I keep the walls from falling down   I keep the walls from falling down      I'll play it straight   While you laugh and drink and party all night long   I'll designate myself   To be the driver who takes you home   I keep the walls from falling down   I keep the walls from falling down      You can be pretty and tragic   I'll try to keep the walls from falling down   You can be beautiful and fabulous   I'll try to keep the walls from falling down   I can't reach the pain you feel   But I'll try to keep the walls from falling down   If you can hold on   Lose your fear   I'll try to keep the walls from falling down   Falling down   Falling down      Where is your saint?.Come on!.Yes, you're ready, and I know it's out of sight..But then she knows it's like a curse   To find our chosen roles reversed   To unify my universe   To call me mellow      If only I was half my age and she was older   We'd live on ice-cream on Coney Island   I though it's gravity that drags down my balloon   She stays in orbit way after midnight      Woah slip and slide   Does she go all dewey-eyed?.He likes burt in white lightning..Uh, I'm coming home.This a'way, Lord Lord Lord,   And I can't go home this a'way."
" I was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store. Trying to build the whole store and I had to go to the bathroom real bad. I started to get real; mad because I thought the store person that was ringing up the stuff tryed to go slow so I couldn’t use it.

"Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of @PERSON1 right next to famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me I’m not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient..The last of the ?.Can't just take it take it..Melvin:Your leaving would hurt my pride..Funny faces loving the traces left for me..I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past..The rain and the wind and the song and the love you bring..Get messed up today,   I'll be ok tomorrow..Hey, hey, yeah, yeah..I got to Kansas City on a Firday   By Saturday I learned a thing or two   Cuz up to then I didn't have an idy   Of whut the modern world was comin' to!.I once believed that love was fair..Runnin'..I just can't stand to see you dragging down."

"One day during the @DATE1 my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was no where in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing. I stopped I felt my back pocket and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Any way, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stuned to see who it was. It was my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to @CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: @CAPS6 I 'm at @CAPS4. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait. In conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient..I'd be wrong from the start   I'd be unfair to my heart   So whatever you do   Don't you say that we're through   I'd do nothing but grieve   If you ever should leave      Oh, what a fool I would be   If I fooled with your love for me   I'd be wrong from the start   I'd be unfair to my heart   So whatever you do   Don't you say that were through   I'd do nothing but grieve   If you ever should leave   I'd do nothing but grieve   If you ever should leave.A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent..A year to the day!.Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, Uh-huh,   Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, Uh-huh,   Next to come in was Mrs. Cow..You light up another cigarette   And I pour the wine   It's four o'clock in the morning   And it's starting to get light      Now I'm right where I wanna be   Losing track of time   But I wish that it was still last night      You look like you're in another world   But I can read your mind   How can you be so far away   Lying by my side?.Move your whole body and let's start the party   As soon as my album goes number one   Mr. Lim I'd like a Rolex with forty diamonds, ha ha ha...)

"One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!.It was all a grand illusion,   Legend in my own mind..All I have to do is swing   And I'm the hero, but I'm the zero..Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught   Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended   As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look   Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended   Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed   For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse   An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe   An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing..You've never driven through a red light,   Or let your mind leave your body..I've seen your face in every cloud,   I've followed the sun   Which brought me back to your side..Since the beginning of time   Since it started to rain   Since I heard you laugh   Since I felt your pain   I was too young, you were much younger   We were afraid of each other's hunger      I have always loved you   There's never been anyone else   I knew you before I knew myself   Oh my baby, I have always loved you      Since we kissed the first time   Since we slept on the beach   You were too close for comfort   You were too far out of reach   You walked away, I should have held you   Would you have stayed for me to tell you?.the avenger..,   Accept our new lord..They pay me not to come home   Keeping me stoned   I won't run away   They say it's easy to get   Stuck in this town   Just like Joan      You know I gave it all up for the stage   They fill my cup up in the cage   It's nobody's business but mine when I'm low   To hold yourself up is not a crime here you know   At the end of the world      I kick my foot at the lights   I breathe it in all night   There's a light on a canvas tree   Money from home supporting me      They pay me not to come home   I won't eat crow   Ill stay away   And though all roads will not lead you home, my girl   All roads lead to the end of the world      And I sewed a little luck up in the hem of my gown   The only way down from the gallows is to swing   And I'll wear boots instead of high heels   And the next stage that I am on, it will have wheels.She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""   You are so old, you are so wise   Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy   Give me a sign, tell it to me   She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""   Then she spoke most quietly   Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee   When you we a child at school they taught you quite a lot   You were told when you should speak and when you should not   You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night   A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not   Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?"".You're getting up in the morning and put on your suit [ca..I was wrong   Again,   I was wrong..I used to have a sweetheart but now I've got none   Since she's gone and left me, I care not for one   Since she's gone and left me, contended I'll be   For she loves another one better than me      Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you   I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you   And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true   And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue      I passed my love's window both early and late   The look that she gave me, made my heart ache   The look that she gave me was harm for to see   For she loves another one better than me      Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you   I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you   And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true   And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue      I wrote my love a letter in rosy red lines   She sent me an answer all twisted and twine   Saying keep your love letters and I will keep mine   Write to your sweetheart and I'll write to mine      Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you   I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you   And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true   And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue"

" Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text. I accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! I am so glad I had such a caring teacher that found that for me or I would’ve failed! When I was sitting down at my desk quietly she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page. I almost flipped out but I held it back. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right. I’m very glad I have a good amount of patience..My babe, she don't stand no cheatin', my babe   Oh no, she don't stand no cheatin', not my babe   Oh yes, she don't stand no cheatin'   She don't stand

"I remember when I wanted to ride my dirt bike and my dad was busy and I waited till he had time to put gas in it.

" One day when I was patient was when we all had to go on the same ride at @LOCATION1 @CAPS1’s out we where going to go on this one ride and there where tons’ of people in line for it and I had to wait patient in line because I was in the back of the line and we where there for about an half hour waiting for to go on the ride and then we wait there patient and the ride was dumb and it is not even going up @NUM1 sets of stairs and then we went on a whole bunch of water park rides and then went home..Christmas bells in the steeple   Ringing out on Christmas morn'   But where are all the people   Where has everybody gone?.Shine it on,   Before you end up out there on your own..(He's always saying what he's gonna do.).It's been a while since the two of us talked   About a week since the day that you walked   Knowing things would never be the same   With your empty heart and mine full of pain      So explain to me, how it came to this   Let's take it back to the night we kissed   It was Dublin city on a Friday night   With vodkas and coke, I was Guinness all night      We were sitting with our backs against the world   Saying things that we thought but never heard   Who would have thought it would end up like this?.Well now, oh Mary Ann   Well you sure look fine   Well, oh oh now   I could love you all the time      Well, now oh Mary Ann   I said baby, don't ya know   Well now, oh oh baby   Don't ya know   Don't ya know baby      That I love you so   Oh yeah, Mary Ann   Gonna take you home tonight   Oh baby, yeah, yeah      Gonna take you home tonight   If you let me baby   I said I'll make everything all right.You looked like an angel, I remember well   How we danced all night and never touched the ground..I haven't' listened to a word you've said   I've been wandering inside my head   Don't care what you think of me   You only see what you want to see   So here I am in my paradise   In my heaven everything is alright   Only the young stay young I said   Speaks the kid inside my head   Only the young stay young inside   Only the young - only the young   Only the young - only the young   I've been around for a long time   Losing my way but not my mind   So I drink and play you along   But who cares when the fire burns on   So I'm out here in my paradise   It's my heaven and it feels so right   Only the young stay young I said   Speaks the kid inside my head   Only the young stay young inside   Only the young stay young I said   Speaks the kid inside my head   Only the young stay young at heart   Only the young - only the young   Only the young - only the young   Live your life - in this time   We've only today - drink life's wine   Don't be fooled   Don't believe what they say   Don't believe what they say   I haven't' listened to a word you've said   Say what you like   You're not in my head   Time goes with each breath we take   It rules the world the day we awake   So here I sit here in my paradise   Don't give a damn everything is alright.Do you feel it terminating in the end?.A woman that gets in your face,   Lord she ain't no friend for you..Before she came home, pit-stopped breast be..And finally we hit the sheets, and kept it goin'   Now I'm mind blowin'..He's kissin' on you."
"Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have..Do you think you can find it?.[Chorus]   Don't take my picture down   Don't erase everything that we had..You can see in my eyes that we'll meet up again      All the girls can be shakin' in the bounce tonight   Gonna do it like we do when the bounce is right   If it's cool we can rock until the morning light   Can you feel the vibe?.His name was Mike McCormick..I don't care if he buys you nice things   Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know   But if you were my girl   I'd make it so we'd never be apart..The champion wants a challenger      Who just might have the strength to   Take him down..Sure I lost my mind, but I never really meant to die..Once my future was shiny as the   Seat of my pants are today   Then old mother luck and all her   Daughters started duckin' me   When I finally got tired of just sittin' there   Watching my life slip away   I said I better start takin' all the living   That's a-comin' to me      [Chorus:]   Now I love too much, fight too much   Stay out late at night too much   But you bet your butt I'm going to   Live before I die   And I may smoke too much, drink too much   Every blessed thing too much   It's a low-down life, but it ain't gonna pass me by   I don't care if the world don't ever hear   The sound of my name   And old mother luck and all her daughters   Keep a-duckin' me   As long as that cat that I gotta look at when   I shave ain't ashamed   There ain't no Jody in the world   I'd ever rather be..La la la   Oh oh oh   Oh oh oh   Can you hear me now?.And Zayn's the master of echoes   And Niall was raised by leprechauns   So he won't ever grow   And Oh, Louis needs that boat   He dresses like he owns one   And it's becoming a joke   They really need your vote      Vas Happenin' boys?.If you feel today that you can't make it   Keep holdin' on, cause you can take it   If you hold on a little while longer   Hold on a little while longer   Hold on a little while longer   Hold on      If you feel it's raining all in your life   And day by day, there's nothin'   Nothin' going right   Just hold on a little while longer   Hold on a little while longer   Hold on a little while longer   Hold on   Hold on      You gotta hold to His hand   God's unchanging hand   You gotta hold to His hand   God's unchanging hand   You gotta build your hopes on things eternal   My God will never let you down      Weeping may endure for the night   But if you trust in Jesus   Everything's gonna be all right   Just hold on a little while longer   Hold on a little while longer   Hold on a little while longer   Hold on   Hold on.You got nothin' better to do, no no!"
"A time when I was patient is when it was winter time and my cousin and I really wanted to go outside. My kept saying “@CAPS1 you will be able to go out”. My cousin was very mad, she was having a fit. I was just sitting there on my couch telling her what my mom said. After an hour past I was able to go outside, but my cousin could not. She wasn’t being patient.

" Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end.

"It was a light breezey morning. It was @NUM1 @CAPS1, my parents were just finishing the packing for @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. We're going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose  ternament in @LOCATION2. It is a terrifying thirteen hour. We started loding to a van with are soutcases. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the @DATE1. That even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in are van. I ran back in the house and unpluged my @ORGANIZATION1 gamecabe.  I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on are trip. As we're just leaving I start pluging in all the wire and game controlles. The we start off. For the first coaple hours we just liscened to the radio. Then came the affect of my brother and sister owe never get going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @NUM2 hours this out and we were in @LOCATION1. We started seing mountains. They were wonderful. @NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the???movie for the last hour. The hour went be like a flash. Finally done that is a time I was sort of patient..Joining hands with wicked ones   Revelation has come to pass   New world order will hold the mass      A book written by the man   Used to control and command   All rights will be denied,   Without the mark you shall die      [Chorus]   No confession, all is known, all is known   New world order, you shall be shown shall be shown   No confession, all is known, all is known   New world order, you shall be shown shall be shown      Monitoring all wages   New world order comes in stages   Currency is obsolete   Feel the agony of defeat      Symbol of society today,   A must have or you shall pay   As humans flesh leads the mind   Just as a pawn the last martyr dies      [Chorus]      Where hath the apostles gone?.Now I'll tell you plainly, baby, what a plan to do..Tell me why, I don't like Mondays..   all (all)   good things (things)   may come (come)   to end (end)      all (all)   bad things (things)   can't wait (wait)   to begin (gin)      all (all)   good things (things)   may come (come)   to end (end)      all (all)   bad things (things)   can't wait (wait)   to begin (gin)      which will shall make u laugh   it shall make u cry   wet can't leave the ground   shall not greet the sky (ummm)   which shall make u laugh   it shall make u cry (ummmmm)   wet can't leave (ummm) the ground (ummm)   shall not leave (ummm) the sky (ummmm).She's got a way   That makes me act like a fool..They're hiding beneath your bed   Crawling between your legs   They're sticking it in your vein   Were you itching when they call your name?.Every picture tells a story don't it?.Would you tremble if I touched your lips?.I'm boarding up my windows   And locking all my doors,   That's what they're for..Can I move on..Go gather the guns..All the voices that are spinnin' around me   Trying to tell me what to say   Can I fly right behind you   And you can take me away      All the voices that are spinnin' around me   Trying to tell me what to say   Can I fly right behind you   And you can take me away      You can take me away"
"Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably could’ve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field..Surely goodness and loving kindness   Shall follow me al the days of my life..Lovely are Your dwelling places   Thirsty I come after You   Jesus, my joy, my reward   Your love's restoring my soul   Now I'm Yours and You are mine   And from my heart a song will rise      I love You, I love You, I love You   I love You, I love You, I love You   I love You, I love You, I love You   And my heart will follow wholly after You      Jesus, there is none beside You   Righteous Ruler of the earth   Nations will come and bow down   Name above all names   I sing Your praises   And all that I can say to You is      I love You, I love You, I love You   I love You, I love You, I love You   I love You, I love You, I love You   And my heart will follow wholly after You      I love You, I love You, I love You   I love You, I love You, I love You   I love You, I love You, I love You   And my heart will follow wholly after You      I love You, I love You, I love You   I love You, I love You, I love You   I love You, I love You, I love You   And my heart will follow wholly after You   And my heart will follow wholly after You (wholly after You)   And my heart will follow wholly after You.Isn't it a pity that this magic city   Turned suddenly cold?.Maybe it's not over yet   Somewhere inside him there must be some   New dream awaiting to topple the rest   When he finds himself   Feeling alive yet alone   Maybe the best he can get is still out of his reach      Ran from the life that he hates   Hoping to find some new beginning   Abandoned the future they gave and   Took away knowing what they would say      Destined to rise above all of the   Simplified answers they gave him   Back there when surrounded by   Love he could not make sense   Of feeling alive yet alone   Maybe the best he can get is   Simply burned by fate      Yet he knows he's the champion of the planet   But he's told he was wrong for somehow deciding to....Awwooooooooo.........

" In third grade one day it was one of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world..Palm trees in black and white   Last thing I saw before I died   Palm trees in black and white   Was the last thing I saw before I died   Right line, right man   Right mixture of cocaine an heroin      Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?.Tell me what's making you sad, Li?.Its hard to imagine that nothing at all   Could be so exciting, and so much fun..Well fuck it then, I've got nothin' but time- I'll wait..Right there it is!.[Russel:] ""No!"".You tell me not to worry   Because you're the boss..Wee-ooo, wee-dle, e-de-oh..We are the wreckin' crew..I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,   I have to turn my head until my darkness goes..And now the time has come,   And so, my love, I must go..You were born to privilege   Licking on a silver spoon   Think you gotta buy all your friends   Just so you can tear up the room   Your kind is a dime a dozen   I've seen it all before   A parasite in a good disguise   Just another wolf at the door      [Chorus]   The wolf   Prowling in the nighttime   The wolf   Howling in the moonshine   The wolf   Gives you what you want but he ain't no friend of mine      You lay it on oh, so sweet   Just like that bad cologne   Just smiling tooth and nail   You gotta make your presence known   But you are only a lonely hunter   Some things you can't disguise   Just to look in the hallway mirror   Now it's howling in your eyes      [Chorus]      Silent, slick and stealthy   Slinking through your evils nights   You can see in the dark they tell me   The daylight burns your eyes   I know you're trying to track me down now   You're right on my trail   Your think you're going for the big big game   But you're chasing your own tail      [Chorus]"
"A A time when I was patience is when our family goes to @CAPS1 point. My family and I go to @CAPS1 point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds)  A couple years later the new ride The @CAPS4 opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didn’t. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we go to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing.I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines..So open your mouth   One more time   And my foot is goin' down   In one ear   Out the other   A waste of time   Don't even bother   I hate bein' here      Think I know   How ya got this far   Think I know   Got where we are   Think I'll hate you   Where you'll be dead   I know it, I hate you   Smile to my face   Know to die   Says the problems   Ask your self way   Hate the games   Hate the rules   You're gonna loose   Say I'm hostile   Gotta relax   Better get a grip   Here's the fact   Not much more of you.Well   Sit right back..Your ooowwwnnn......I feel free""   Huhh...

"Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. There were flys everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” @CAPS1 quickly replied. “@CAPS5! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “well I don’t wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might!” by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didn’t get front cart the wait wasn’t even that bad..Closer than I've ever been   With you..I've heard how some people, have said   That I've changed   That I'm not what I was   How it really is a shame   The thoughts in their heads,   Manifest on their brow   Like bad scars from ill feelings   They themselves arouse   So hateful of anyone that is happy   Or 'free'   They live all their lives,   Without looking to see   The light that has lighted the world   It's funny how people, just won't   Accept change   As if nature itself - they'd prefer   Re-arranged   So hard to move on   When you're down in a hole   Where there's so little chance,   To experience soul   I'm grateful to anyone,   That is happy or 'free'   For giving me hope   While I'm looking to see   The light that has lighted the world.Where do I belong forever,   In whose arms, the time and place?.Let the birds sing,   Dilly dilly,   Let the lambs play..I opened up the letter that the   Postman gave to me this morning   Had to stop myself from shouting out   ""I love this world""   When I'm in your arms   Is this heaven?.Music is a mirror   Near around my soul   Music is the spirit   Come on let it roll   Music is my nature   People have you heard   Music is my future   Music is the world   Let it all be music   People sing a song   Let it all be music   Let us sing it on and on and on   Let's play the music   My kind of music   Let's play the music   Play it on and on and on and on   Music isn't somewhere   Music turns you right   Music is a fever   Leads you day and night   Music is like heaven   Where you wanna be   Music is religion   Music set's you free   Let it all be music   People sing a song   Let it all be music   Let us sing it on and on and on   Let's play the music   My kind of music   Let's play the music   Play it on and on and on and on   Music is tomorrow   Music is today   Music is forever   Music is the way   Music is for women   Music is for men   Music is for children   Sing it all again   Let it all be music   People sing a song   Let it all be music   Let us sing it on and on and on   Let's play the music   My kind of music   Let's play the music   Play it on and on and on and on.I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees..Chorus:   Why you plan, girl?.I cried out but no one could hear me..Yeah I don't want no bald headed woman   It'll make me mean yeah lord it'll make me mean   Yeah I don't want no bald headed woman   It'll make me mean yeah lord it'll make me mean      Yeah I don't want no sugar in my coffee   It'll make me mean yeah lord it'll make me mean   Yeah I don't want no sugar in my coffee   It'll make me mean yeah lord it'll make me mean      Yeah I'm traveling on a bald headed mountain   I've done my time, I've done my time   Yeah I've been traveling them bald headed mountains   I've done my time, I've done my time   I said I've done my time, I done my time   I said I've done my time now yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah   I've done my time yeah, I've done my time yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah      Don't want no bald headed woman baby   Yeah gonna make me mean, make me mean   I don't want no bald headed woman   That's gonna gonna make me mean make me mean now      Don't want no sugar in my coffee   Gonna make me mean, make me mean   Don't want no sugar in my coffee   Gonna make me mean, make me mean.It's hard to imagine that nothing at all   Could be so exciting, could be so much fun..[Kalan]   Oh no I won't ever leave you now   Or never I promise."
"Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacher’s help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient..Have I gone crazy   Is there someone new   Something strange is going on   Between me and you   But tell me baby   Tell me it's not true   'Cause I've been hearing things about you      Are you unhappy   Are you lonely too   Won't you tell me face to face   What you're gonna do   Well I still love you   But I'm nobody's fool   I've been hearing things about you      Yeah I heard I've been dancin'   When you're out there runnin' 'round   And I heard you've been seein'   Some stranger you have found   And I heard you've been thinkin'   About tellin' me we're through   Yeah I've been hearing things about you      Yeah I heard you've been thinkin'   About tellin' me we're through   I've been hearing things, oh I ain't naming names   I've been hearing things about you.When I look up from my pillow   I dream you are there with me   Though you are far away   I know you always be near to me      [Chorus]   I go to sleep, sleep   And imagine that you're there with me   I go to sleep, sleep   And imagine that you're there with me      I look around me and feel   That you are ever so close to me   Those tears that fall from my eyes   Bring back memories of you and me      [Chorus]      I was wrong, I was right   I will love you till the day I die   You alone, you alone and no one else   You were meant for me      When morning comes once more   I have the loneliness you left me   Each day drags by until night   Finally descends on me      [Chorus].If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain   Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again   Out there is a fortune waiting to be had   If you think I'll let it go you're mad   You've got another thing comin'   You've got another thing comin'   You've

"My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight eclips, me and my mom were heading to the movie theature and I wouldent stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, “@CAPS1’s one mom” “sweet,” she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours strate. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin.

"I am never patient. Weather its waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend I am never patient. The only time I can be patient is when im waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if im waiting for school to start. Then also the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I will run around the house for hours until a friend calls. ?? when they do call I rush right to the phone and answer it right away. I will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room.

"My cousin was patient when we were waiting in line for the top l will @CAPS1 at (cedar point. The line almost took @NUM1 hours. My cousin was just simpily silent cvery unasul) and just waiting .I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet running around etc. I was about to die of boredom .My legs hurt, I was hungry, I was too hot. I just couldn’t stanistrn. She was just standing there not talking. When we started to move I got a little happier but still impatient. After @NUM1 hours we finally got into the ride. After the ride I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said for every word one of us said we have a minute of homework when we come back to @LOCATION1. I was stuck doing homework the next whole week. Thats how I learned my lesson to be patient.Oh love, oh love, oh careless love,   Now now don't you see what your careless love has done..I bet you thought you were really good   You've come to this as someone told   I bet you'd never knew you would   Gonna bring   Green hell.[Chorus x2].Surrender to the sound   Of nothing else around?.Until the dawn is, breaking through..You never want to feel so sad and lost again   One day you could be looking   Through an old book in rainy weather   You see a picture of her smiling at you   When you were still together   You could be walking down the street   And who should you chance to meet   But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?.Will you be everything I need?.I see the Rings around the Sun, I know their Names I see the   Colors turn and run, I stay the Same..Hey you guys look who's waiting outside She got style you can see it in her feline eyes Well she may be flashin' like a neon sign But you can't touch her 'cause she's mine all mine..- a son   How can we see that far?.And love did come   But in such disguise -   That I could   Hardly recognise!.(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)"
"Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don’t. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn’t stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over “stiff upper lip.” I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn’t work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. “I want to go home” I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said “@CAPS2” all grouchy. I had sniffled and said “I want to come home, I miss you.” and sniffled more. “Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.” @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1’s car. “@CAPS4 didn’t you want to stay?” @PERSON5 asked calmly. “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks..I'm never gonna let you down,   Never make you wear no frown..This song in my heart, this song in my soul   This song I was born to sing   It's Your song of freedom, now I'm free to dance again      I'll sing in the darkness, I'll laugh in the rain   Rejoice in Your love again   It's Your song of freedom, now I'm free to dance again      Your Spirit brings me liberty   Your breath of life has set me free      Chorus:   Jesus, Your love, it lifts me high   Gives me reason to run the race with joy   This song within me, Lord, will bless Your Holy name   Jesus, I'll dance before Your throne   Bring this heavenly sound to You alone   This song within me..You throw shade, I throw it too, more than you can   chew....I'll be the summer breeze that never ends..Don't leave me cause of some   Stupid things we said..[Xzibit]   (Yeah) I can drink a whole Henessey fifth   Some call that a problem but I call it a gift   Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah)   Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory   A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct   Bitch niggaz continue to floss and lip-sync   And I'ma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat   Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope   Don't make my desert eagle barrel touch the back of your throat   Always approach niggaz that's known for killin your folks   Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all   Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall   Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags   No retaliation you basically runnin with fags   In these streets, you only good as your last transaction   Funny style, and these niggaz ain't laughin   y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero   Think life is a video for ""Last Action Heroes""   Face the price you pay for the games you play   When it's all said and done at the end of the day, you gotta      [Chorus - repeat 2X]   Get your walk on, get your head right   I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right   Get your bounce on, back dat ass up   Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up      [Xzibit]   Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed   When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift   Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock   Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop   It's the best thing crackin my nigga   Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver   From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags   earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas   Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah)   You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah)   Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket   Melt your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid   Drastic measures we take just to get by   for all the shit you gotta go through to get high   Stand by, do or die for the West coast   want to fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers      [Chorus - repeat 2X]   Get your walk on, get your head tight   I know you feelin the shit, the shit is dead right   Get your bounce on, back dat ass up   Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up      [Xzibit]   Tell y'all people to call my people   Recognize all men are not created equal   I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through   Only the kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!).(Jimmy Cliff)      Sitting here in Limbo   Waiting for the tide turn..Tell me what you need?.You and me always together..Into this world we're thrown   A lifeform without a home   Clowns in a circus called the material world   Gods without immortality, nothing to lose   Nothing to gain, nothing to keep   Shepherds of dreams, we are what we are      Lovers, losers, loners, leapers, liars   The meaning of life and I want to touch   Your astral body !!!.Dig your nails in..We are sailing away on a river to the sea."
"Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That on main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is @CAPS1 mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull.??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check up. The @CAPS6 said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side I t means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her and she screamed ”@CAPS3 is going to have babies”then I scremed with her. We went and got dixixe and then we took her to the bark play and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now @CAPS1 was get bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be six months atleast until she has the puppies it`s aready been five and half, mom said, that she has milk now’ I told my sister, @DATE1 . “I wouldn`t doubt it,’ said @DATE1 then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today” then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now. “then we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said “oh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babies” we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright.” I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier. Tinker, bella, harmony and melony. I love my dogs!.But I keep on singing my songs and I still got some soul..Ooh!.Could it be I like you,   It's so shameful of me,   I like you      You're not right in the head and nor am I,   And this

"I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient..Cyanide a suicide   No thoughts of pain   Genocide a crucified martyr's laid   Down to the dust there to fade away..Even though you find it hard   To catch your breath, much less smile      Take heart....Any time you're feeling low   Is there anywhere that love cannot reach?.Revelation, unknowing has been taken..Dozens of ways   Dozens of reasons   Shielding our hearts from pain   Riddles of romance   That distance may yet explain..Natalie Portmanika   It's time to celebrate Chanukah,   I hope I get an Abtronica   On this joyful, joyful Chanukah,   So get a high colonika   And soil your long-johnnakahs   If you really, really wannakah,   Have a happy, happy, happy, happy,   Happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah!

" Being patient isn’t that hard if you try. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for ???. Five minutes past and they still weren’t don so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still weren’t done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done ??? was only two minutes. ??? well I guess I give it another try and if I still don’t get I’ll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasn’t making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said that we didn’t have to do that one and I laughed and told her ??? figure it out all yesterday.

"I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while..Recorded by Hank Snow   Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain   Every dream has only brought me pain   All my life I've always been so blue   Born to lose and now I'm losing you..Enough to make my systems blow..Well they been so long on lonely street   They ain't ever gonna look back..Hey!.What's good enough for you   Is good enough for me   It's good enough   It's good enough for me   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah      Now you'll say   You're startin' to feel the push and pull   Of what could be and never can   You mirror me stumblin' through those      Old fashioned superstitions   I find too hard to break   Oh maybe you're out of place      What's good enough for you   Is good enough for me   It's good enough   It's good enough for me   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah      (good enough) for you   Is good enough for me   It's good, it's good enough   It's good enough for me   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah      Old fashioned superstitions   I find too hard to break   Oh maybe you're out of place      What's good enough for you   Is good enough for me   It's good enough   It's good enough for me   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah      (good enough) for you   Is good enough for me   It's good, it's good enough   It's good enough for me   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah      (scat).And then we lie, beneath a shady tree,   I love her and she's loving me..Whatever you've got..I've got ten thousand troubles, a million woes   Got grief in my soul nobody knows   I've got heartaches, I got stingin' water fallin' out of the sky   I've got heartbreaks, I got a long lost lover, got a reason to die   I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes   I got grief in my soul nobody knows   I got sorrow, I'm in a storm that'll spare no travelin' man   I fear tomorrow, got a love that died long before it began   I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes   Got grief in my soul nobody knows   I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes   Got grief in my soul nobody knows   I've got a cold chain, I got rain fallin' on my head from above   I've got a bad pain, I got a gal don't know the meaning of love   I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes   I got grief in my soul nobody knows   I've got heartaches, I got stingin' water fallin' out of the sky   I've got heartbreaks, I got a long lost lover, got a reason to die   I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes   I got grief in my soul nobody knows.What are these friends for?.I'm about to bon bon   Chicky bon bon bon me..Bestow upon me knowledge   Wizard, all-knowing, all-wise   I want to rule my kingdom   Make sweet the breeze, not once defiled   Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists in velvet gloves of sin   Parade the grey-robed monks, the vestal virgins   And wheel the wyvern's in   Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage   Let me be the protege of five magics      Give me alchemy!.What a swell party this is   What frails, what frocks   What furs, what rocks   What gaiety!"

"Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4’t have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but here’s a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like there’s no tomorrow. To bad I couldn’t play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience..” @CAPS1” ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face. “ @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing “he added. “@CAPS4’t get to happy , there’s still plenty of time left.” I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I ‘d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, “who is the loser now, huh?” wow all it took was patient, and hope” I told myself. Patient can mean a lot.

"Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experience difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do @CAPS11 I did it before. “@CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2, this isn’t even moving.” @CAPS3 brother and @CAPS3 broter obvousilly wasn’t being patient. Hello, @CAPS13 me mame, I mean man, can you walk any shower? “@CAPS4, I can if you want me to.” A nice man said in a kind friendly voice to @CAPS5.” @CAPS6, are you that dumb, I wasn’t for real. I m cut you just because of your stupuidity .” @CAPS5 said, trying to act all tough. @CAPS5 was only a year older than me (@NUM1) and he thinks he’s all big and can di anything he wants. “@CAPS8, little man you can’t cut me, I was waiting in line forever.: that nice man said to @CAPS5. “ well , too bad .” while @CAPS3 brother was  making eniesnes, was waiting patiently in line even though the line wasn’t really moving, inside I wanted to out every one @CAPS11 not like some people I have patients and can wait. After @CAPS3 brother cut that man and didn’t get punished he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very very mad at @CAPS5 @CAPS11 not one did anything besides say,” @CAPS8 don’t cut me.” @CAPS11 that didn’t’ really help. Intill @CAPS5 cutted the @CAPS15 person. That person was a young pretty body with beautiful blue eyes and has such pretty blond hair, her name was @PERSON1  “@CAPS13 me police man, this  young , little boy just cutter we and every one else. “@PERSON1 said. While I was waiting there patiently, @CAPS5 got kicked out of the whole park’ @CAPS15 in line please, “  “ @CAPS1 that’s me …. Won.Were “was the best roller coaster I had ever been on.

"Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, it’ll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have..How many lives have been shaken   'cause a few simple actions were not taken   There will be a time, time for the next world   Can't let the feelings be left unsaid   Chorus   Will you still be there when the night comes   The glory's over and the chill comes   When the night comes, will you still be there   Will you still be there when the night comes   Will you still be there?.His needs are more, so he gives less..Nowadays people want more, more and so do I   My brother told me once   You always wnat what you don't have   But take a look at all the things you do have   So the reason why I wrote this song   Was to express what I think is wrong   I'd like to be just a little bit taller   I'd like to be just a little bit prettier   I'd like to be just a little bit stronger   But hey whatever   Chorus:   Don't always want what you don't have   But be grateful for what you have   Don't always want what you don't have   But be grateful for what you have   Well you can call me the consumator   'Cause I never stop   Feeding myself with all these obstacles untill I drop   I want a house, a fat cat, my own sauna and a pool   Have a yacht, my own piano and finally be cool   I'm like that kid screaming to his mama ""I want that toy""   'Cause my filled room at home no longer gives me that joy   And I don't recommend myself as someone to employ   'Cause I want it all   Chorus   I want the world just to leave me alone   Wanna move to New York and learn the saxophone   I wanna jam with Miles Davis and John Coltran   I've got so many wishes I think I'm going insane   But what the hell am I supposed to do   'Cause I'm trying real hard to undo all the emptiness inside me   Which is why I want so much   Chorus.Hold me my daddy,   It hurts me to see grown men fighting this way..With no kind of chance for the flag or the Liberty Bell   Wish a Ford and a Chevy could still last ten years, like they should   Is the best of the free life behind us now   Are the good times really over for good?.You don't wanna be the little woman I love, I love..You know that I love You   You know that I want to know You so much more   More than I have before      These words are from my heart   These words are not made up   I will live for you, I am devoted to You      King of Majesty, I have one desire   Just to be with You, my Lord   Just to be with You, my Lord      Jesus, You are the Saviour of my soul   And forever and ever, I'll give my praises to You      You know that I love You   You know that I want to know You so much more   More than I have before      These words are from my heart   These words are not made up   I will live for You, I am devoted to You      King of Majesty, I have one desire   Just to be with You, my Lord   Just to be with You, my Lord      Jesus, You are the Saviour of my soul   And forever and ever, I'll give my praises to You   Jesus, You are the Saviour of my soul   And forever and ever, I'll give my praises to You      King of Majesty, I have one desire   Just to be with You, my Lord   Just to be with You, my Lord      Jesus, You are the Saviour of my soul   And forever and ever, I'll give my praises to You   Jesus, You are the Saviour of my soul   And forever and ever, I'll give my praises to You.I'm Henry VIII, I had six sorry wives..Or am I all alone?.Zero in on my full of intentions,   I think you got it because you pulled up and stopped..Jesus cleanse me now.Now we stand in a special place   What will you do here?"

"Frezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk with themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and @CAPS7 hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tooth time. “@CAPS4, I got it!” @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say joining them into my pockets. “@CAPS6, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said, “@CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”.When you hear that I'm a cowboy   And I work the cattle trail   You probably assume I'm big and tough (big and tough)   But the trail's worn me down   I don't wanna hang around   I've just about had enough (had enough)   Ya see, I like a nice cup of Espresso   And I like to read my People magazine   I co-ordinate my chaps   But everybody laughs   And say they don't like that shade of green   Oh no, it's true   I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do   Oh no, it's kinda strange   I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range   Well I try to eat a healthy balanced diet   But they all eat their brown beans from the can   They all have to smoke about 6 packs a day   You'd think they was the Marlboro man   And they don't like to go to see the opera   On Friday nights when they get paid   And they don't help me bring in the hanging plants   Every time there's a Native American raid   Oh no, it's true   I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do   Oh no, it's kinda strange   I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range   Cowboy life sure is different these days..

"A time I was patient was when I had to baby sit little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else..[Chorus: x2]   I am hungry   I am hungry   Give me something   I am hungry   Feed me   Give me something   Street crazy      I am nobody, I am nobody, I am nobody      [Chorus]      Yes, they're cropping up now with alarming frequency   These little group eyes   Wasted people standing around   Those who've been kicked ass backwards   Hard out of our society   As we try for the better,   For the higher in man   They may as well be apes, you know   Trying to comprehend the way of death      [Chorus]      Shovel it up the street, shovel it up the street, shovel it up the street   And it gets me down   And it gets me down   This is the vision I see   Street crazy.Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,   None but ourselves can free our minds..Les love (Les lo), les sex (Les lo), les lo oh, we could call it,   Les love (Les lo), les sex (Les lo), les lo oh, we could, we could call it,   Les love (Les lo), les sex (Les lo), les lo oh, we could call it,   Les love (Les lo), les sex (Les lo), we could call it love..It's a mighty world we live in   But the truth is we're only passin' thru      I have stood up on the mountain   I have seen the other side   I have wrestled with the devil   I have wrestled with my pride      I have been down in the valley   Stood out in the rain   I have seen my love forsaken   Felt the pleasure and the pain      If there's one thing that's for certain   Yes, one chord that rings true   It's a mighty world we live in   But the truth is we're only passin' thru      I have cried in tears of sadness   Cried in tears of joy   I have found a life worth livin'   From the peace within the noise      I have turned my back on hatred   Lyin', prejudice and greed   Found the future in the present   Found hope within a seed      If there's one thing that's for certain   There's one chord that rings true   It's a mighty world we live in   But the truth is we're only passin' thru      Passin' thru, passin' thru   It's a mighty world we live in   But the truth is we're only passin' thru      I have seen my bucket empty   Seen my well run dry   But there's water down the road   And I'm only goin' by      If I'm settin' on dead ready   When my chances come to knock   I'll make it where I'm going   Standin' tall just like a rock      If there's one thing that's for certain   There's one chord that rings true   It's a wicked world we live in   But the truth is we're only passin' thru      Passin' thru, passin' thru   It's a mighty world we live in   But the truth is we're only passin' thru   Yeah, it's a mighty world we live in   But the truth is we're only passin' thru      I have stood up on the mountain   I have seen the other side   I have wrestled with the devil   I have wrestled with my pride      I have been down in the valley   I have stood out in the rain   I have seen my love forsaken   Felt the pleasure and the pain      I have cried in tears of sadness   I have cried in tears of joy   I have found a life worth livin'   From the peace within the noise      I have turned my back on hatred   Lyin', prejudice and greed   Found the future in the present   Found hope within a seed      I have seen my bucket empty   I have seen my well run dry   But there's water down the road   And I'm only goin' by      If I'm settin' on dead ready   When my chances come to knock   I'll make it where I'm going   Standin' tall just like a rock      Passin' thru, passin' thru   It's a mighty world we live in   But the truth is we're only passin' thru   Passin' thru, passin' thru.Up on the white veranda   She wears a necktie and a Panama hat..Drink with me!.Para de jugar con mi corazon..It was back in '32 when times were hard   He had a colt..My man is the best in the world,   He's got the sun in his heart and the moon in his soul..Only in dreams   We see what it means   Reach out our hands   Hold on to hers   But when we wake   It's all been erased   And so it seems   Only in dreams.Just an echo?.Or should I just keep singing right here by myself?"
"There haven’t been many times were I was patient but I’m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that!.If it weren't for kids have you ever thought   There wouldn't be no Santa Clause   Look what the store just brought   Thank God for Kids      We'd all live in a quiet house   Without Big Bird or a Mickey Mouse   And cool-aid on the couch   Thank God for Kids      Thank God for kids there's magic for a while   A special kind of sunshine in a smile   Do you ever stop to think?.Said, ""Ooh ooh, how did this become?.How they usually stay      Beating on a drum   Did they tell them 'take it in'   Got the (???).Who let you go?.And I can't hide from the feeling cause it's right..No scientist or biology   It's obvious when he's holding me   It's only natural that I'm so affected      And my heart won't beat again   If I can't feel him in my veins   No need to question, I already know      It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA   It's in his DNA   And he just takes my breath away   B-b-b-breath away   I feel it every day   And that's what makes a man   Not hard to understand   Perfect in every way   I see it in his face   Nothing more to say   It's in his D-D-D-DNA      It's the blue in his eyes that helps me see the future   Fingerprints that leave me covered for days, yeah, hey, yeah   Now I don't have any first degree   But I know, what he does to me   No need to work it out, it's so familiar, oh, oh, oh      And my heart won't beat again   If I can't feel him in my veins   No need to question, I already know      It's in his DNA D-D-D-DNA   It's in his DNA   And he just takes my breath away   B-b-b-breath away   I feel it every day   And that's what makes a man   Not hard to understand   Perfect in every way   I see it in his face   Nothing more to say   It's in his D-D-D-DNA      It's all about his kiss   Contaminates my lips   Our energy connects   It's simple genetics   I'm the X to his Y   It's the color of his eyes   He can do no wrong   No, he don't need to try   Made from the best   He passes all the tests   Got my heart beating fast   It's cardiac arrest   He's from a different strain   That science can't explain   I guess that's how he's made   In his D-D-D-DNA      It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA   It's in his DNA   And he just takes my breath away   B-b-b-breath away   I feel it every day   And that's what makes a man (what makes a man)   Not hard to understand (to understand)   Perfect in every way (in every way)   I see it in his face (in his face)   Nothing more to say (nothing more to say)   It's in his D-D-D-DNA.It's like a dream, no end and no beginning..The things that I did wrong,   I'll bet you've got a list..Yeah, I'ma lean low nigga, to the flo' nigga   Can you pay what you weight gimme mo'?.I didn't even say that you died   But it wouldn't have been such a lie   'Cause then I started to cry      How the hell does a broken heart   Get back together when it's torn apart?.Where's the woman you love?.Let It Snow!"
"I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it..I wanna turn the clock, yeah, right back to where it was..Call me an animal,   And I wont deny..And I love your eyes..Winter has come for me, can't carry on   The chains to my life are strong   But soon they'll be gone   I'll spread my wings one more time      Is it a dream?.There is a light that hits the gloom around   Shows the footprints round this grave   Dried up roses scattered on the mound   Honoring the one engraved      Will ever the morning   Carry away   The souls of those for whom we cry?.Field and glade wait only for rain   Grain after grain love erodes my   High weathered walls which fend off the tide   Cradle the wind   To my island..As I lay me down   Heaven hear me now   I'm lost without a cause   After giving it my all      Winter storms have come   And darkened my sun   After all that I've been through   Who on earth can I turn to?.When we were running in and out of time,   But all the time we still believed in life..Well, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world   Do you remember t   The face of a pretty girl   The face of a pretty girl      Looking back so long ago   You had a knack, a knack of making women know   Ooh there wasn't the time   And i knew you'd nver be mine      Well, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world   Do you remember   The face of a pretty girl   The face of a pretty girl   The face of a pretty girl      Isn't it midnight on the other side of the world   Do you remember   The face of a pretty girl   The face of a pretty girl   The face of a pretty girl.You pick me up when   I am down and on my own   You hold my hand and lead me on   Into Your plans      Whenever I cry out You hear me   Whenever I fall down You hold me      I want to live for You   My God You are my all   God help me stand for   You each day and be Your voice      Whenever I cry out You hear me   Whenever I fall down You hold me   Whenever I stand up You're with me   I know Your Spirit's living in me      Hold me, never let me go   Change me, I want the world to know   You are living in me   God I know You'll never let me go      You'll never let me go   You'll never let me go      Hold me, Hold me   Hold me, Jesus never let me go      You'll never let me go.It's a measure of people who don't understand,   The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band..Girl, I can tell by the look in your eyes   And the way that you back it up   I can tell that you like it rough rough - oh yes it's obvious!"
"ON @DATE2 I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldn’t get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasn’t doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her I’m fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn’t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids but her self and @NUM2 of them is hises.  But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. But beening @CAPS1 I didn’t want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all here stuff she looked pretty everything went while but know on on we still cry in think about her. Then that was a time I didn’t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she’s in a better place with some of her love ones. But into this day I can’t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone.

" In this narrative essay I will write about @NUM1 different times when I was out had to be patient. Such on the waiting to get out of school on a holiday. And when I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so I could get my game. Another thing I had to wait for was to get my final so as in the ??? all these times I had to be understanding. One day  I was very anxious to get out of school on a firday. And to make it I bad the clack was drare and I had  a planned schedule of my think day. When one thought passed by there like another set  in thinking for way I can stare at the abat and it would change. I was about to get a call home but the @CAPS1.A saved me. And I had to be understanding about that moment. Another time I had to be understanding about was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See what had happened was I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it. My mom was asleep it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before.

"Being patient is a valve. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient..Everytime she's close to me,   My heart is filled with ecstasy,   And like a dope, I let the chance slip by..And people are real people, not just playing..Not me, no..If you gotta, go down!.Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off   With a skirt of green net sewed over   With flat metallic circles which dazzled and flashed   The lights were violet and [Incomprehensible] white   I had an ornamental veil, I can't bear to use it      With the way my hair was cropped, I craved, craved covering   But now that my hair itself is a veil   And the scalp inside is a scalp of a crazy   And a sleepy Comanche lies beneath this netting of skin      I wake up, I am lying peacefully   I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun   I desire him and he is absolutely ready to seize me   In, in, in, in, in heart, I am a Muslim, in heart, I am an American   In heart, I am Muslim, in heart, I'm an American artist and I have no guilt      I seek pleasure, I seek the nerves under your skin   The narrow archway, the layers, the scroll of ancient lettuce   We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly   The mole on the belly of an exquisite whore   He spared the child and spoiled the rod   I have not sold myself to God.To keep our cities safe from criminal scum..It was 9-29, 9-29 back street big city..No good, papa's no good, sister's no good and that's a drag   Sometimes you feel like your heads on the ceiling   When you scream your mama rag   When your daddy come home with an old soup bone   And take all your money away   And your mama's in the kitchen on the phone she be bitchin'   And your girlfriend who called to say      [Chorus]      High school lover with ya cops undercover and gettin' high, drank Lebanese   Hey mama choose that you been through   And it's right between your knees   Hair case, shotgun, rock on, chewing gum, take it to the dance tonight....Hundreds of believers,   Lured into a doomsday cult..And it's hard to make up lines for things you don't do..The day you're mine this world will be in tune,   Let's make that day come soon..Et les vents do nord, les emportant   Dans la nuit blanche de n'oubli   Que moi, je n'ai pas oublie   La chanson que tu me chantais   The falling leaves drift by the window   The autumn leaves of red and gold      I see your lips, the summer kisses   The sun-burned hands I used to hold   Since you went away the days grow long   And soon I'll hear old winter song   But I miss you most of all, my darling   When the autumn leaves start to fall"
"Who likes being patient it’s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they’re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it just be patient and it will pay off..Always the same dreams yeah yeah   Always the same (yes you're movin' up)      You're beautiful, you are, and you know it   You're wasted here, you're a star   In this small town of hand-me-downs who don't even know it      Sometimes it brings you down   Sometimes it eats you up   Sometimes you think that your head's going to blow   It doesn't get better..This is your final fling      But then applause ran high   But for the patience of the ones behind you   As a verse drags on like a month drags on   It's very short, but it seems very long      And the song that you just sang   It sounds exactly like the last one   And the next one   I bet you it will sound   Like this one      So, get off the stage   Oh, get off the stage   And when we get down off of the stage   Please stay off the stage - ALL DAY !.Shake it up, shake it up   Move it up, move it up      Brother   Who, who?.Once again you're gone   Somewhere in the night   Disappearing   Leaving me alone   The lure of city streets   The pull of unknown souls   The overpowering draw   Of the unknown   You've been stealing   That's so unkind   Stealing   A heart, a mind   I'm appealing   Stay with me tonight   Cruel young lover   Hit the action   Can you live on your attraction   Time may take your cruel power away   Cruel young lover   Try to stand out   Will it always pay   To bland out?.I got stuck in a traffic jam,   My major meeting didn't go as I planned..Man tells me: ""Son, that ain't the way,   Gonna make a deal with you child,   Gonna live another day..how we turned into a joke   And it's truth IMd give anything to hold   Tonight, tonight I stay   But you, you slip away      Where you goin   As fast as you can run   And where you goin   You hide behind the sun   Stay down low   Stay down where you are   And where you goin   Don't let them come after you      I trip trip trip in vain   I like to get a away   You like it like you do   I like to be with you   I like to live up there   But I wake up and I   I wake up and I   I wake up and I'm here   Tonight I am stuck here   And tomorrow I,   I disappear      And where you goin   As fast as you can run   And where you goin   You hide behind the sun   Stay down low   And stay down where you are   Cause it's better there   And it's better than we thought.(parsons, bairnson, elliott)      There must be a thousand ways   Holding us within this maze   Every path we take leads us astray   Comfort me my only son   Till the day my work is done   There's no earthly reason we should stay      And when the wind gets under these wings   You will feel what freedom brings   Stay right by me, walk don't run   I don't want you flying too close to the sun      Turn your eyes towards the light   Steal away in silent flight   The skies are calling out to you and me   Over sea and over land   God protect us with your hand   Bring us safely to our destiny      And now the wind is under our wings   We can taste what freedom brings   Stay right by me, walk don't run   I don't want you flying too close to the sun      God forgive his fall from grace   The sea conceals his resting place   Can we learn to stay behind the line   If we have the means to fly   Some of us will surely die   Being reckless was his only crime      And now the wind is under our wings   We can taste what freedom brings   Stay right by me, walk don't run   I don't want you flying too close to the sun      Vocal niel lockwood   Guitars ian bairnson   Drums stuart elliott   Bass john giblin   Keyboards gary sanctuary, richard cottle and alan parsons   Saxophone richard cottle.(Hello, hello, hello)      Yoko's cutting keys in Soho   I've been there and I should know oh face it   I'll stick up for Aunty Sally   Worzel's just a dirty scally fragrant   Mia Farrow's patching marrows down at the place where all the face fit   Robin Cousins doing dozens on a little pudding so he rakes it      I'm the reserection   I may steal your soul   I am fairly evil   I live for rock and roll      Shirley Bassey's playing Lassie up a pole in Tallahassee hates it   Norris Mcwhirter's doing furters in a little place how's he fake it   It's another appetiser I can go and buy a Tizer laced fit   I don't know where I've been but I know where I've been is near a lake      I am an erection   I may steal your soul   I am fairly evil   I live for rock and roll      (Sock it to me daddy)      I am an erection   I may steal your soul   I am fairly evil   Only for rock and roll      (Dance dance)   (yeah yeah)      (Hello, hello).Can't let it go!.Maybe baby, I'll have you   Maybe baby, you'll be true   Maybe baby, I'll have you for me   It's funny Honey, you don't care      You never listen to my prayers   Maybe baby, you will love me someday   Well, you are the one that makes glad   Any other woman just makes me sad      When someday you want me, well,   I'll be there, wait and see   Repeat Verse 1   Repeat Bridge   Repeat Verse 1   Maybe baby, I'll have you for me.Trust me, P is no pimp   See I got heavy pockets, so I walk with a limp   One night with he, and I'll make ya scream   You'll wake up, like it's a dream   Call downstairs, tell em to make us pjs   Right after that, dry cycle our pjs   Right after that, book us a pj   What you mean how?"
"A time that I showed patience is when my sister broke my futon. It was the day that I had gotten it and I was in the living room watching a movie when all of a suddent I heard ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!"" I ran upstairs to find out what happend and I saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost.  I showed patience by not yelling at them. I soon got another futon that isn't broken and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break!

"I’m going to tell you a time when I was patient. a time I was patient was when I had to save up my money to get the new game halo reach. I had to pre order it with my money, so I did a bunch of work so I cut the lawn at my house then I cut other peoples lawn for two dollars so I did that for about two months at the end. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks so I did just that. I waited and bought some other stuff with the left over money and the game finaly came in the mail. that’s a time I use patients to wait for something..All of these promises   Were only made to break..Don't you wanna see how it ends?.[Chorus]   Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel   Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so   Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you   Can't help it if there's no one else      I can't help myself if you look like an angel   Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so   Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you   Can't help it if there's no one else   Mmm I can't help myself   Myself   Mm   I can't help myself   I can't help myself   Oh, Oh,   Mm   Mm.Well, a travelin' man's affliction makes it hard to settle down   But I'm stuck here in the flatlands while my heart is homeward bound   Goin' back, I'm too tired to roam, Loma Prieta my mountain home   On the hills above Santa Cruz, in the place where I spent my youth   Well it was Neal Cassady that started me to travelin'   All the stories that were told, I believed them every one   And it's a windin' road I'm on you understand   And no time to worry 'bout tomorrow when you're followin' the sun      Papa don't you worry now and mama don't you cry   Sweet woman don't forsake me, I'll be comin' by and by      Goin' back, I'm too tired to roam, Loma Prieta my mountain home   On the hills above Santa Cruz, in the place where I spent my youth.First met you in a southern town   On a warm November day   You made me smoke like a whirlwind   I knew we had nothing to say   Love me but don't try and make me stay      Southern woman   Take my soul but don't you take my life   Southern woman   Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife      Once again in the early spring   I touched your raven's crown   Your wild eyed stories of rare delight   Like to knock me down   It's getting so damn hard to put you down      Southern woman   Take my soul but don't you take my life   Southern woman   Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife      Southern woman   Take my soul but don't you take my life   Southern woman   Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife      Southern woman   Take my soul but don't you take my life   Southern woman   Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife      Southern woman   Yeah.Three, cause you look so good..We are the crowd   We're c-coming out   Got my flash on it's true   Need that picture of you   It's so magical   We'd be so fantastical      Leather and jeans   We're rock glamorous   Not sure what it means   But this photo of us   It don't have a price   Ready for those flashing lights   Cause you know that baby I      [Chorus]   I'm your biggest fan   I'll follow you until you love me   Papa-paparazzi   Baby there's no other superstar   You know that I'll be   Your papa-paparazzi   Promise I'll be kind   But I won't stop until that boy is mine   Baby you'll be famous   Chase you down until you love me   Papa-paparazzi      I'll be a girl backstage at your show   Velvet ropes and guitars   Yeah 'cause you're my   Rockstar in between the sets   Eyeliner and cigarettes      Shadow is burnt   Yellow dance and we turn   My lashes are dry   Purple teardrops I cry it don't have a price   Loving you is cherry pie   Cause you know that baby I      [Chorus]      Real good   (We're dancing in the studio)   Snap snap to   (That shit on the radio)   Don't stop   (For anyone)   We're plastic but we still have fun!.Do it in the name of love..But from her pale face and her pale skin, a moonlight shined..The longer I look at you   The fairer you become   Every time I hear your voice   Sweeter is the song      Each glanced borrowed from your eyes   Deeper is the story   Wind burns your sleeping breath   And waters become one..What happened?.On days when the weather was fine   And while we were running around   You were nowhere to be found      You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed   Well you were made to play games with your soul instead   The child inside you died"
"Have you ever had enough patients to deal with @NUM1 screaming  kids. I,can proudly say that i can. It all started when my uncle steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed alot of help so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem was there where @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But,it didnt take long  for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. So all of the @NUM1 kids start fighting. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was atleast a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn’@CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @NUM1 hours I’d had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about @NUM7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patients I had.

Every day  is  patient sometimes I can’t wait to  get  out  of  school so  I can  play. I’m always trying to be patient because it’s one holiday after another each one gets more exiting.  Every kid tries but being patient is one of the most hard thing to do.

"One time there were two twin chipmunks, there names were @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 always had patience A.J not so much. One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed up there camping gear and headed farther into the woods it was around dusk when they reached were they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire, @LOCATION1 started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how there mom and dad had taught them. As l said in the first part @LOCATION1 has no patience so he kept on trying but after awile he stopped he would hit the rocks together once and it wouldn’t start so @PERSON1 tried in @NUM1 minute he got it started. A.J. didn’t care he got the acorns and started cookin. But every time he’d only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds so he tried and tried finally he just stopped well it @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes, @LOCATION1 was really mad now so they went to bed.

" One day I was being really patient. I was baby sitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or you’ll go to your room. So he stoped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home now that a whole different story. So thats the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters..""Hey man, you pissed in your pants""   ""I know""   ""So did I""   ""I guess that makes us piss pals""   Ha ha ha!.I take from my loved ones   To gamble on my friends,   I take the long way home   And the fun never ends,   Woke up blurry-eyed   Wonderin' where I've been,   I've wrestled with my conscience,   But my conscience never wins..I never knew love could be this way, baby   If you knew she didn't love you, why didn't you resist?.Everybody loves it, football..Do I sit here and try to stand it?.Etc!.[All] Someone call the doctor, nan geunyeoga pilyohae   Harudonan beotil su eobseo (beotiji mothae)   Beoseonago sipji anheun jeongeok gateun neo   Gin gini deocheun areumdawo Eh-oh      Too much, neoya, your love, igeon Overdose   Too much, neoya, your love, igeon Overdose.Oh the mad dog days   I say oh they're just mad dog days   In them mad dog days   I don't care if it's true   Between me and you   Can't see it through   Please, let me say goodbye..Now your free,can't you see?yeah this time I won't be led by you, Yeah!.We can      [Repeat: x2]   Do it, do it, do it..This bad-ass bitch creeping up on me   She had the look that could get the ice cooked up in a second   I pictured her undressing and gettin' butt-naked   She walked up to me and said her name was mary jane   Ain't no shame in my game, Down to do anything   Took me by the hand, Ask me if i'd like to fly   You know I like to fly   [Chorus]   [Verse 3]   Now here's a zig zag story that I'm havin' right now   Gotta get myself together, Cause some shit is goin' down   Hit you people off with my new cd   Hard to swallow, Like saying ""fuck the industry!"".Why don't you call me, miss o'dell?"
"Patience is about whaiting and having what for staff you want like if I wont anything Patience is that you have to what before you get it.

" Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone..So high   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh   Can we get much higher?.See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met   If you're desperate ask Yvette, cause she'll say ""Bet""..Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo..Until it's cold,   Slowing you down until you can't go..Let's swim to the moon, ah ha   Let's climb through the tide   Penetrate the evenin' that the   City sleeps to hide   Let's swim out tonight, love   It's our turn to try   Parked beside the ocean   On our moonlight drive      Let's swim to the moon, ah ha   Let's climb through the tide   Penetrate the evenin' that the   City sleeps to hide      Let's swim out tonight, love   It's our turn to try   Parked beside the ocean   On our moonlight drive      Let's swim to the moon   Let's climb through the tide   You reach your hand to hold me   But I can't be your guide      Easy, I to love you   As I watch you glide   Falling through wet forests   On our moonlight drive   Moonlight drive   Moonlight drive      Come on, baby, gonna take a little ride   Goin' down by the ocean side   Get real close   Get real tight   Baby gonna drown tonight   Goin' down, down, down, down   Goin' down   Goin' down, way down   Down, down, down, down, down   Down, baby low   Children of the caves will let the   Secret fires glow      When the still sea conspires an armor   And her sullen and aborted   Currents breed tiny monsters,   True sailing is dead..Boy says, ""man are you crazy?"".""Go talk to him."".Yes, it's the lovin' things   That keeps us wandering....I just wouldn't be living at all....Perfect crime   God dammit it's a a perfect crime   Mother fucker it's a perfect crime   Don't ya know   It's a perfect crime.It's just another sad song."
"It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. So we sat around till all of they were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said “why did you get of line?” “I am scaryed.” “ I want to go on it though.” “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 said” @CAPS1 we go on the ride?” “@CAPS2 we @CAPS1” my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when @CAPS4 said “I @CAPS1 wait.” “@CAPS3 lets get it over with.” @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now..We've been down, we've been out, we've been hanging round..(We've been waiting.).A simple man in a complex world got the means,   But the know how escapes me....Fragile seams   I opened my too quick and all my dreams   Were walking out I'd slowly   Lost my fire   With every single man a river cried      I had no sensation   Completely numb, left with no satisfaction   I thought no-one could ever get me high again   I swear, I was not looked      Oh, waited so long   I thought the real thing was a fake   I thought it was a tool to break me down   You proved me wrong again      If love were liquid it would drown me   In a place less place would find me   In a heart shape come around me and then   Melt me slowly down   If love were a human it would know me   In a lost space come and show me   Hold me and control me and then   Melt me slowly down   Like chocolate      Tastes so good   My heart's been mended who'd have thought it would   An empty bet and still I won the cash   A man who I love and who   Loves me back      Oh, waited so long   For love to heal me so I'd feel it   Thought it wasn't breathing then you came   You proved me wrong again      If love were liquid it would drown me   In a place less place would find me   In a heart shape come around me and then   Melt me slowly down   If love were a human it would know me   In a

broken dreams   He's the open door   People need the Lord   People need the Lord   When will they realize   People need the Lord   We are called to take His light   To a world where wrong seems right   What could be too great a cost for   Sharing life with one who's lost   Through His love our hearts can feel   All the grief they bear   They must hear the words of life   Only we can share   People need the Lord   People need the Lord   At the end of broken dreams   He's the open door   People need the Lord   When will they realize   That we must give our lives   For people need the Lord

" Pg @NUM1: @CAPS1 her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were @NUM2 of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! So we couldnt even more our arms I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was @NUM3 oclock in the morning and I saw a big sign that read welcome to @CAPS2. So at that point we only had a hour or so left I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination key wrap. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tryed my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didnt are and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @NUM4°@CAPS3 degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didnt even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But how I know I have the patients to go home!.What?.Let me in, let me in,   Let me in your heart..Me recuerda tiempo atras   Estrellas y una noche alla   En la lumbre azul Fernando   Tarareabas tu cancion   Con ese suave guitarrear   Yo podia escuchar   Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar      Se acercaban mas fernando   Y el momento que pasaba   Parecia eternidad   Y senti temor Fernando   Por la vida y juventud   Nadie pensaba en morir   Y no siento hoy verguenza al   Confesar que tuve   Ganas de llorar      Algo habia alrededor quiza   De claridad Fernando   Que brillaba por nosotros dos   En proteccion Fernando   No pensabamos jamas perder   Ni echar atras   Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer   Lo haria ya Fernando   Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer   Lo haria ya Fernando      La vejez llego Fernando   Y con ella una paz   Que hoy logramos disfrutar   Se durmio el tambor Fernando   Paraciera que fue ayer   Que lo vivimos tu y yo   Y en tus ojos veo aun   Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor..Do we not love her I think we all tell you about   Do we have to roam the world to prove how much it hurts?.Like the heavenly spirit resting from above..I would've slipped off my jeans   And slipped on my heels   If I knew that I would see you   Yeah, this diamond ring, gets kinda loose   Gotta watch myself around you   Glad you finally said something   Cause it's been weighin' on my mind

feel guilty   But it's getting awfully hard to believe      I'd never ask you   Would you leave the one you love   I'd never tell you   I want you so bad it hurts   I like the way you make me feel   Baby can we make it real   If we don?t make it real   Then we aint' doin' nothin' wrong.I only wanna get up there   A bad bitch rollin' up some good   Light it up and hand me it   All I wanna do,

before the bitter words come crashing down   Let's leave what's left, and the lights go out      And fade to blue   We didn't make it through   There won't be a curtain call   Just fade to blue      Almost happy endings have no way of coming true   Once the feelings starts to fade to blue   We didn't make it through   So let the curtain fall   Just fade to blue   And fade to blue"
"Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4’d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didn’t belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “@CAPS3!” I shouted, “I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop” I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  “@NUM1 minets till midnight” @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me “That’s impossible” I told her. “You can make it.” @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. “@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen” how is it going to end” @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. “@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad” @CAPS10 asked. “I guess not” I answerd sheepishly. “Being patient payed off’ @CAPS10 lectured. I didn’t reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that I’m a little better at being patient things will be a lot better..      Ain't had no fun      all the time jacking around      ain't had no fun      all the time messin mind      I kick it around      but if it's alright with you      if it's alright yes I will      aw c'mon babe      go ahead to the kill      I ain't no kid Chicago      I ain't no Al Capone      but there's a windy city      in my bedroom alone      I said I don't live in Chicago      I don't know no Al Capone      that bitch took my money      and went to Chicago      if I ain't already enough      sick and alone      wher's it at      it's down down it's downtown.If you try to divide and conquer   We'll rise up against you   We know, only the strong will survive   But the meek will inherit   So if you got a coat of arms   Oh friend   I suggest, we wear it      We are the people   And we live forever   We are the people   And our future is written in the wind   On the wind.But I couldn't do it all alone, we!.I don't care if you don't   I don't care if you don't   I don't care if you don't care   I don't care if you don't care   I don't care if you don't care   I don't care if you don't care   I don't care   Everyone's so full of shit   Born and raised by hypocrites   Hearts recycled but never saved   From the cradle to the grave   We are the kids of war and peace   From Anaheim to the Middle East   We are the stories and disciples of   The Jesus of Suburbia   Land of make believe   And it don't believe in me   Land of make believe   And I don't believe   And I don't care   I don't care   I don't care   I don't care   I don't care.there, OK, OK   I'm so cold, just hold me.Do it in the name of love..Just dance?.Every single thing's your fault   With you it's always something   When everyone's the same   Don't you try to blame me.Three more days and I'm home..Just not your kind..Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa   I think you could make me girl   Could make me take my life   I know you can break me girl   Take all of me   All of me, yeah hey      Wake up   My love   Never thought you'd make me, break me   Now I'm up from below   Such a brilliant star you are.Does it feel the same?"

It has everything I love, a spote park mony and tree stuff. I went there with my mom I told her she doesn’t have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stared well I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me cheered me and even got me a new board.

"@PERSON1 is a young boy with a bladder of a squirrel and his waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited for his turn. @PERSON1 was in the middle of the line behind five people. @PERSON1 was a head of six people that were all doin the pee-pee dance. He learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it. @PERSON1 learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes..Everybody else is busy doing better than me   And I can see why it is   They got someone setting them free   Someone breaking the chains   Someone letting them be      Could you be that person for me?.[Chorus]   AYYY, I'm the clean up man!.Save our city..Girl: No!.You sound demented   Is it because someone talked and she told me?.I ran into your best friend today   Twelve nights since you ran away   I asked about you and she said, can't say, can't say   I'm feeling lonely and it seems to stay   It's been a while since I felt that way   Well, I can tell you there's no room to play this game      All I know is what I'm missing   What I'm missing is your kissing   Are you listening?.On top of Jim   Newspaper says: We support the Prez   The war on terror   Bombs away   How much is life?.(It's In His Kiss, Shoop Shoop Song - Betty Everett)      Is he drug-free?.The teenage queen, the loaded gun   The drop dead dream, the Chosen One   A southern drawl, the world unseen   A city wall and a trampoline      Oh well, I don't mind, you don't mind   'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine   Before you jump   Tell me what you find   When you read my mind      Slipping in my faith until I fall   He never returned that call   Woman, open the door, don't let it sting   I wanna breathe that fire again      She said, I don't mind, you don't mind   Cause I don't shine if you don't shine   Put your back on me   Put your back on me   Put your back on me      The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun   When you read my mind.Ooh, on the beach at cartegena   She, salty baby with the name-a   Oh, chiquita   Oh, love chiquita      She, takes to walkin' in the sunshine   She, she'll be lovin' till the moon shine   Love chiquita   Oh, love chiquita      She, got the poppy-eyed desire   Tease, till the boys put out the fire   Love chiquita   Oh, love chiquita      Oh no no, now don't you wake me up I'm dreaming   No no no, if you shake me I'll be screaming   Love chiquita   Oh love chiquita.You think you ball, well I palm it..Take me back to his door."
"That's gotta hurt! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang.

"Here I was on @CAPS1 third day of volley ball tryouts. I was sure I was going to be on the A team. I tossed the ball up and let @CAPS3 drop back down. The toss was no good. I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. “@CAPS1 last serve” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didn’t make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word “congradulations.” @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldn’t of had @CAPS3 any other way..It's about time!.Dressed in purple velvets   With a flower in her hair   Feel her gentle spirit   As the champa fills the air      She wears rubys on her fingers   Tiny bells upon her toes   She's the finest thing   I've ever seen   Love that ring inside her nose      Flower Child yeah   Flower Child yeah      She's a psychedelic princess   On a magic carpet ride   And where her trip will carry you   Is somewhere you can't find      She's on a plane of higher consciousness   Meditation is the key   She's got her shit together   'Cause her soul and mind are free      Flower Child yeah   Flower Child yeah      She's a child of Martin Luther   As a freedom fighter she   Speaks of liberation on the land   And on the sea   Her eyes are made of sunshine   And her lips are jelly sweet      Flower Child yeah   Flower Child yeah.?.Long was our wait   Our meeting with Fate is tonight..There was love,   On the other   Side of the world..Lovin'   Baby, you're lookin' fine and mama, I can read your mind   Come on anytime, little Miss..Come baby, rock me, come baby, locl me into the shadows of your heart   Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start   I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for   And I will always be emotionally yours..Now you're probably wondering by now   Just what this song is all about   What's probably got you baffled more   Is what this thing here is for..All I have is yours,   All you see is mine   And I'm glad to have you in my arms,   I'd have you any time..Whoa      [Chorus].I'ma hit you up later      2 up 2 down I see you (haha)   Lets go   Yes sir (peace)   And now you know   I'm out   (Peace).Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?"
"Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you..Faithless heart      Oh, faithless heart   Be far away from me..She's got a date with another man..Yeah live and let live motherfuckers,   I'm a do me you do you..I'm trying to explain to myself   I can have both   I'm trying to explain to the voice inside   I can have both   I can have both   There's nobody around to say no   Who've brain-washed the small shy boy inside   He doesn't know he can have both      I can have both   There's no need to choose   Because   I can have both   There's no need to choose   I can have both   There's no need to choose   Because   I can have both   There's no need to choose   I can have both   There's no need to choose.(nevermore)   You sent me to the path of nevermore   When you say you didn't love me anymore   Ah ah nevermore nevermore.To save the pain   Of once my flame, and twice my burn..It's been   thought before..All those little times you said that   I'm your girl   You make me feel   Like your whole world      [Pre-Chorus]   I'll wait for you babe,   That's all I do babe,   Don't come through babe,   You never do..Mimi!.I love ya and I need you, by my side..I'm not the way you think I am   The only girl who ever gave me the time   Was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine   Knocking boots in the back, how degrading is that?.It is now 1831, and as always I am   absorbed with a delicate thought."
"Everyone has to have patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say “Patience is vertile.” @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”.At first just a rustle of canvas   And the gentlest breath on my face   But a galloping line of white horses   Said that soon we were in for a race      The gentle sigh turned to a howling   And the grey sky she angered to black   And my anxious eyes searched the horizon   With the gathering sea at my back      Did I see the shade of a sailor   On the bridge through the wheelhouse pane   Held fast to the wheel of the rocking ship   As I squinted my eyes in the rain      For the ship had turned into the wind   Against the storm to brace   And underneath the sailor's hat   I saw my father's face      If a prayer today is spoken   Please offer it for me   When the bridge to heaven is broken   And you're lost on the wild wild sea   Lost on the wild wild sea....There's you walking down the street,   Children running 'round your feet..Let's take a ride   Out in the cold air   I know the way, why don't you go there with me?.Our life could be...   Are you satisfied?.Yeah   You're my Creator King, You're my Creator King   You're my Creator King, You're my Creator King.I was born country and this country's what I love..She put me in shame and in sorrow and I come home tomorrow   Oh, Louisiana   Oh, Louisiana, yea, yea, Creole baby, Cajun queens   Quaint porches and windows, filet de gumbo, the Basin beans   Your beautiful Delta and bayous in greens   Oh, Louisiana   Oh, Louisiana, yea-e-e, yea, I'm flyin' on Delta Nine-o-three   Right over St. Louis, high over Memphis, Tennessee   On southward to the sea, where I long to be   Oh, Louisiana   Oh, o, Louisiana, yea, yea, them Yankee nights are cold and long   Oh, Louisiana, she broke my heart and wrecked my home   She shamed me in sorrow, to face my tomorrow   Oh, take me back, oh, Louisiana.You stand face to face and your heart gathers place   For the answer to a question a prize   If only you had known to be honest was wrong   For the work that you've done you will pay with your eyes      [Chorus]   Into the black where the night   Never ends and the light   Leaves a scar on your soul   Where your heart used to hold   Your love here!.Don't take it away from me..Chorus      Bridge --   You'll Always be in my Life,   And if I'm not your Life   You're in my Memory..Whose heart is the biggest?.Would you let me live?"
"My neighbor was very patient when he killed that @NUM1 point buck for the first time! He was??? and proud that he caught this beautiful white tail deer!. He said he`d never been this proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered my neighbors’ face when he told me, I was so happy for him. If I had the money I would have got something for @NUM1-point buck. When I got to sec the head my jaw dropped it was the most beautiful deer I’ve ever seen..'Cause when a Bible's well used,   The devil's not amused..You walk down the street   And all the young punks whistle at you..Give me an old fashioned Christmas, an old fashioned Christmas   Family faces, wide open spaces, covered with snow   Right now my mom there in the kitchen, basting the Christmas bird   You'll have to take my word, you can't find that at the automat   An old fashioned fireplace, give me an old fashioned fireplace   My heart remembers smoldering embers, warming your glow   I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline, the shimmering steel and chrome   For one old fashioned Christmas back home.All you really need is a pyramid and just a little luck..Get back Loretta..Here we are,   Back in the sunshine again   No more worries,   No more pain      Well we're leaving behind, all our trouble and strife   That's the way it's gonna be, oh, the rest of my life      Well here we are, here we are, back in the sunshine again   No more worries, no more worries, no more pain, no more pain      Life's too short to spend it lonely, you only throw it away   Listen to your voice of reason, yeah call it a day, ay, ay, ay      Take a ride, take a ride, out to the land of the free   Don't hurry, take your time, take your time   Come spend it with me, ooooh   Back in the sunshine (2X)      Here we are, back in the sunshine again   No more worries, no more worries, no more worries   And no more pain      Life's too short to spend it lonely, you only throw it away   Listen to your voice of reason, you call it a day, ay, ay, ay      Here we are, back in the sunshine again   No more worries, no more worries, and no more pain      Here we are, here we are, yeah we're back in the sunshine again   No more worries, oh no and no more pain      Why, why, we're back in the sunshine again   No more worry or pain   Yeah we're back in the sunshine again.I saw you coming   With that poison in your hand   Now you're acting kind of funny   Like you don't seem to understand      Stop complaining   You've been caught fair and square   I saw you coming   I was guarding you that day      I saw you coming   Golden rule, you disobeyed   You were too busy showing off   How you gave yourself away      Stop complaining   You've been caught fair and square   I saw you coming   I was guarding you that day   I saw you coming.You're looking at foreclosure   And doing time,   And it don't sound good this time..The pages of the history books can tell you of his fame   And the fear that struck the settlers at the mention of his name   And in Mexico they won't forget the vengence of this man   Who blazed a bloody battle trail and terrorized their land..It's our lives, it's our lives!.Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey?.Well I'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout the world and it's hang ups   Gonna get myself together, take a ride downtown   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see him, see him today   He's gonna blow me away      He makes me happy when I'm feeling down   Take away my worry takes away my frown   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see him, see him today   He gonna blow me away      If you wanna feel groovy, give the doctor a call, yeah   Doctor rock will help you anytime at all   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor   Gotta see him, see him today   He gonna blow me away   Oh, right away"
" Once when me my dad were supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait until my dad and he said he was getting of work at @NUM1 oclock and that’s the time the races starts. It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasn’t going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in there cars. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. @CAPS1 they did figure eight boat race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said “no w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.” @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2..(Inside the mind of a car jacker)   And that bitch is slippin'..Gonna pick you up tonight at one..I will remember you..!.Look him in the eye   Look him in the eye, and tell him..He just holds his breath..We should give all our love to each other..I'm always looking for a minute that we can steal   Cause I need more of how you make me feel   I used to be the king of wasted time   Cause it made no difference till I made you mine      Now I wake up in the morning with a smile on my face   Can't get enough of the human race   Ain't loved like this since I can't remember when   Baby you made life good again oh yeah darlin you made life good again      I like the way you talk and the way you look when it comes to loving you wrote the book   Cause when you kiss me ..Ignorance!.If you want   Dance!.Had to have it your way, had to play games,   Now you're begging me to stay..Night in the city, oh oh oh,   Madness at midnight,   Night in the city   Drivin' you insane."
"On a super hot summers day, me, my mother and @CAPS1 all went to best western. The reason is that we don’t have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasn’t worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe..My love, my love, where did you go?.Don't give a damm   If we were in love   I'll fall in your arms   I love it when you talk to me      (Courus)      Take it slow, takin it slow   Babu it's besy if you   Talk that talk to me   I'll love it when   You talk that love      Don't forget me at all   Your in my heart   So when were old and gone   You'll be wiv me all de time.[Chorus].I'm your midnight man, if you don't know by now, somehow I'm gonna make you understand,   I'm your midnight man and I love you till the daylight babe..I just didn't know... Hmmmm      I left fifty kids standin' in line, they were whining, they were crying   and their mothers they were screaming in hysterics and I swear   I never heard such profanity      I dropped my suit on the floor   they were trying to block the door   They were calling her a whore   They were driven to nativities insanity   We drove away in her Mercedes Benz, dirty blond split ends in the breeze   She said ""I want to put you under my tree   You're just a little gift from me to me""      Cause I'm in no man's land   Can't seem to find a real man   You know I'm lookin' for a steel man   She said I'm in no man's land   You know I'm ready for a real good time   I'd gladly pay you double overtime      She had money all her life   She wasn't lookin' to become my wife   She said, ""I hope you understand   I just want a nightful of man, Sonny""      She didn't notice I was thin with a delicate chin   Nor the softness of my skin, nor the scent of my other personalities   She didn't see through my disguise - didn't see it in my eyes   She was in for a surprise when she discovered my emotional plurality      She said ""Come and lay down on the floor with me   It's warmer here by the fire""   She didn't know that there was more of me   She'd have to learn to love all four of me      Cause I'm in no man's land   I'm lookin' for the real me, If only I could feel me   You know I'm in no man's land   Sometimes I gotta play me, It's really hard to stay me   Hey, I'm in no mans land   I'm looking for the real me, If only I could feel me   You know I'm in no man's land   Sometimes I gotta play me, It's really hard to stay me   Oh, I'm in no man's land   I'm looking for the real me, If only I could feel me.So what are we going to do now   On heaven and earth   What are we going to do now   Tell me what is worth to you...   Doctors try to save them   Priests don't know how to tell them   There's nothing you can do but repent   You might think that he's a hero   But like Nixon Mao or Nero   All you know is that they came...

She says I'm ok..Hold your glock your whole goal is props   You'll never get 'em   My rhythm just fluctuates   You can't o.d..Since you left me girl, it's broken down."

" When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen..Don't you know?.Check my custom machine      Well she's metal flake blue with a corvette mill   (Check my custom machine)   And they say it looks better when she's standin' still   (Check my custom machine)   When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa   I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine      Well with naugahyde bucket seats in front and back   (Check my custom machine)   Everything is chrome, man, even my jack   (Check my custom machine)   When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa   I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine      A stereophonic speaker set with vibrasonic sound   (Check my custom machine)   Magnesium spokes, it stands an inch off the ground   (Check my custom machine)   When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa   I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine      Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo.Are you happy?.You're already falling it's calling you back to face the music   And the song that is coming through   You're already falling the one that it's calling is you      My a promise take a vow   And trust your feelings it easy now   Understand the voice within   And feel a change already beginning      Oh, won't you tell me again?.Can't you feel the change   aka People Oh People   People Oh People   There are mountains in our way   We got brother against brother   How will we stand on judgment day?.I am not a lucky man...

"Patience is having control over yourself write you wait. In order to be patient you have  to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. @CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. Fon example if you go to the doctor office for a yearly check up , you have to sit in the waiting room for at reast one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an @CAPS1 is ,is something someone mode up.

"I’m going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. When you we’re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it’s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, but now, I’m done. (yes!).C'mon baby, let the good times roll   C'mon baby, let me thrill your soul   C'mon baby you're the best there is,   Roll all night long..And yet I tolerate you..Never a blemish on your face   Skinniest guy I could never replace..Worn with pride, into battle I'd ride at a warrior's side..Did you ever want to just lose touch with everybody you know?.But I can't find my way home..Or did you take a u-haul?.You walk into the room   Without a broom   To sweep away time lost   At all cost   Wallace hears everything   Wallace hits everything   Wallace hunts everything   Wallace hurts everything   Wallace hates everything.Oh God my brain is racing   (I love you!).Those other guys will put you down, As soon as they succeed..She was just fifteen years..Save me!"
"One time I was patient. I don’t want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves.

"“Patience is a virtue.” I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did.

"I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when she couldn’t find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat was on the on phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isn’t that patient and I learned I’m not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn’t. That’s  the time of when I know  someone was patient..(It was) Three feet high and a hundred long..(and wear a Ninja suit?).Watched the moon pass by my window,   The stars faded out of sight..I know this pain   Why do lock yourself up in these chains?.This big ocean liner took her so far away..Stir them in my witches' brew..We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,   Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,      Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,   We saw ourselves now as we never had seen..All these feelings   I'm tired of them   Ruined all of my life again   Emotions aren't my friend   I gave keep ordered as best I can      [Chorus:]   I can, you can   We can, who can   Keep it all together   Hit man, burn man   His man, her man   How about the weather?.Cause one little Christmas tree   Can light up the world   So those who are lost may find their way..Always screwing with my mind, a thorn in my spine   Oh Sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time   In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine   Wait!.Aha   Aha   Aha   Aha..Father's hands are lined with dirt   From long days in the field   Mother's hands are serving meals   In a cafe on Main Street   With mouths to feed   Just trying to keep clothing on our backs   And all I hear about   Is how it's so bad, it's so bad      It's too bad it's too bad   Too late, so wrong, so long   It's too bad we had no time to rewind   Let's walk, let's talk   Let's talk      You left without saying goodbye   Although I'm sure you tried   You'd call the house from time to time   To make sure we're alive   But you weren't there   Right when I needed you the most   And now I dream about it   And how it's so bad, it's so bad      It's too bad it's too bad   Too late, so wrong, so long   It's too bad we had no time to rewind   Let's walk, let's talk   It's so bad   It's too bad it's too bad   It's too late, so wrong, so long   It's too bad we had no time to rewind   Let's walk, let's talk   (Let's talk)      Father's hands are lined with guilt   For tearing us apart   Guess it turned out in the end   Just look at where we are   We made it out   We still got clothing on our backs   And now I scream about it   And how it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad      It's too bad it's too bad   Too late, so wrong, so long   It's too bad we had no time to rewind   Let's walk, let's talk   It's so bad   It's too bad it's too bad   It's too late, so wrong, so long   It's too bad we had no time to rewind   Let's walk, let's talk      No time   Let's walk   Let's talk"

"Book @CAPS1 ‘And the characters lived happily ever after……..for now!’ @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages we’re left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results we’re very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “@CAPS3’s wrong!” @CAPS11 her mom. “@CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish.” “@CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience” said mom. “Patience? @CAPS3’s that?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don’t complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient.” “@CAPS6 I’m waiting” said @CAPS7 “@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot.” The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. “@CAPS9” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS3’s this?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “@CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12’s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.” “@CAPS13 you” said @LOCATION1. She couldn’t belive @CAPS12! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait..Yo, they still be grindin', and runnin'   Tryin' to get into somethin' or nothin'   I remember them days, when the block got hot,

" Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient..Don't go away..although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time..You got a dream, you've got it bad   But it's just another one of those fads   Just a joke, gone up in smoke   Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope   Lost your money in a parking lot   It was funny but it's all you've got   You're walking home, with sticky clothes   And a very healthy overdose   Oh Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Oh Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Ain't got no shoes   Ain't got no job   Ain't got no decent banks to rob   Ain't got no rent   You pitch a tent   But the parking meter money's spent   You need a girlfriend like a kick in the head   Sleeping all night solo with the grateful dead   Yeah you know it ain't easy   Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Chorus repeats   You've got a dream, you've got it bad   But it's just another one of those fads   It's just a joke, gone up in smoke   Leaves you dangling on the end of a rope   You're walking home, with stiky clothes   And a very healthy overdose   Yeah you know it ain't easy   Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child   Oh Johnny it's you yeah Johnny it's you and you're a love child.Whoa, hear me now..You could still come, bring me those fancy pastries..Yes, you are, yes you are      You are my heat   You are my fire   You make me weak with strong desire   To love you child my whole life long   Be it right, or be it wrong      I just want to satisfy you   Though you're not mine   I can't deny you   Don't you hear me talking baby   Love me now or I'll go crazy      You're the heat, you are the fire   You're not mine, I can't deny ya   Don't you hear me talking, baby?.I need your love, I need your love, God speed your love to me!.My baby, there's something you should know   About me, before you propose   Although we have known each other for quite a while   Whenever you need me   I'm gonna try to make it through to you   But I'm not always ready to   When you are not watching   I prepare myself for you   But I worry that I might have been misunderstood      [Chorus:]   I gotta tell you, I want to tell you   I can be lazy but I'll try not to   Maybe I'm not a very honest person   Right now you're sure that you love me   But are you really sure that you know all about me   Up and down and down down down down we go      My baby, a lot could happen before tomorrow   Think about the pain before you take another dose   Who knows if it could be good for you after all   Whatever you give me   I'm gonna try and give you something new   Not something you've already chewed   When you are not watching   I prepare myself for you   Because this could be good   What's buggin' you      [Chorus]   I gotta tell you, I want to tell you   I can be crazy when I don't want to   Maybe I'm not a very honest person   What if I don't want a baby yet   Is it okay if I'm not cute and naive   Up and down and down down down we go      This could be good   So I gotta tell you, I want to tell you   You can be shady...

"Last year t went to @LOCATION1 city with @CAPS1 mom, @CAPS1 step-dad, @NUM1 of   @CAPS1 brothers, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and, @CAPS1 her @NUM2 kids @PERSON1 and sack. The first place we went was he state of liberty. We got in live for the ferry that takes you to the island where the statue of liberty is. We got in the line for the ferry that toves you to the island where the statue of liberty is. The line was hug antic. I thought, ""@CAPS4 great"" because it was neatly @DATE1 outside and we were going to the waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the live goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty. It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. @CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of way self for not complaining. Apparently @CAPS1 mom was to because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me a side and thanked we for being so patient.I've got to move on and be who I am   I just don't belong here   I hope you understand   We might find our place in this   World someday   But at least for now   I gotta go my own way      Don't wanna leave it all behind   But I get my hopes up   And I watch them fall everytime   Another colour turns to grey   And it's just too hard to watch it all   Slowly fade away   I'm leaving today 'cause I've   Gotta do what's best for me   You'll be ok....Sort of trust that you'll get..Somebody gonna love me..Yeeeaaahhh...

"Two summers ago I went to @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1. We had to drive for @NUM1 hours straight. I mostly just sat in the back seat and listened to my @NUM2 player. @CAPS1 was a very boring car ride. On the way I looked for licence plates with different states on them. We were half way there so we stopped at a dunkin donuts, @CAPS1 was early in the @TIME1, my sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate. Then we got to a whole bunch of little booths were you have to show your passport to got in. And finally we were in @LOCATION2. We stayed there for @NUM3 or @NUM4 nights. Then we were on the rode again for @NUM5 hours. to go to @LOCATION1. When we got there, all the patience paid off.

"On a morning @DATE1 when every one of my family members wake up at @NUM1 or @NUM2 o’clock am. Me my brother and my sisters told my mom “can @CAPS4 play the @CAPS1 and the labtop.’ @CAPS2 said sure but you guys have to wait until each other’s turn” and @CAPS4 said “ok.” @CAPS3 the @CAPS4 played it.

" The word patience means a lot of things. It can mean waiting and something and much more. It also talks a lot ??? It takes time and effort. I’@CAPS1 the type who complain a lot and I don’t have patience. Other people they don’t complain they an it. A lot of teenagers have no patience. As you get older you develop patience some adults don’t have patience it depends on if you work at it. It also depends on whether the person has gone through in life..Waoh Oh Oh Oh!.Repeat chorus      When the angel on the treetop requested a song..Oh, tell me where, the answer lies   Is it in her kiss or in her eyes   It's a lover's question I'd like to know..You aint' the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got..I don't want to but I'm losing you.The world, it only seems to change from where you look much different   Than the pictures that they took it's nothing like they said it would be.No, I can't      I can't be your only one   No, I can't be your only one   'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met   And your love is three times better, how could anyone forget?.Come on everybody, we're gonna' have a good time, yeah,   Gimmie' all the love that's in ya', I'm gonna' give ya' mine..Vet?.(Do you love me?.Now Mari and her mother are an awful lot together   In fact you hardly see the one without the other   And people often wonder if it's Mari or her mother   Or both of them together I'm courting      [Chorus]      Well up among the heather in the hills of Benafee   Well I had a Bonnie lass sittin' on my knee   A bumble bee stung me right above the knee   Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee      [Chorus]   Well I said to bonnie lass how we gonna pass the day   She said among the heather in the hills of Benafee   Where all the boys and girls are making out so free   Up among the heather in the hills of Benafee      [Chorus]      Wedding's on a Wednesday, everything's arranged   Soon you'll never change your mind unless your mind is changed   Of making the arrangements and feelings lots of rage   Marriage is an awful undertaking      [Chorus]      Sure to be a grand for grand of that a fair   Gonna be a fork and plate for every man that's there   And I'll be a bugger if I don't get my share   Although I may be very much mistaken      [Chorus]      There's a neat little lass and her name is Mari Mac   Make no mistake, she's the girl I'm gonna track   Lots of other fellas try to get her on her back   But I'm thinkin' that they'll have to get up early      [Chorus].Every day I sit and wonder how my life it used to be   Now I feel like going under, now my life is hard to see   So tell me people, am I going insane?"
"My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill it’s over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn’t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave..I saw your friend 1st   That's who I danced with   All the time I was watchin' you      The music rocked us   Our eyes locked-thus   Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo      If a man is considered guilty   For what goes on in his mind   Then give me the electric chair   For all my future crimes-oh!.Such a rush x15   Look at all the people going after money..All of the wolves gather 'round..In the dance halls   Can't you feel the shame?.Ridin' on a greyhound, countin' those white lines   Destination I don't know and I'm feelin' like I'm dyin'   Well ten years on this road, my its took its toll   But the man with the plan says the band has got to go   I said roll gypsy roll   Lord just pick up your bags and go      Met many a woman on my way down the line   Every woman that I met I left satisfied   I made lots of money, just how much I don't know   But most of the money I done stuck up my nose   I said roll gypsy roll   Lord just pick up your bags and go      Gypsy's life's a story and its one that's never told   He's always hungry, he's always on the go   With no tomorrow, its how it seems to be   When you're moving around from town to town      Made lots of money just how much I don't know   But most of the money I done stuck up my nose   And maybe that's the reason I don't know where I'm going   I don't know.Come home, come home   Ye who are weary, come home   Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling   Calling, Oh sinners come home..Yet I still wait for it's return,   Just like I still wait for you..You and your pussycat nose !.'cause I been tryin' to, tryin' to get away, yeah..I won't share you, no   I won't share you   With the drive   And ambition   The zeal I feel   This is my time      The note I wrote   As she read, she said   ""Has the Perrier gone   Straight to my head   Or is life sick and cruel, instead?"".Please don't make any sudden moves,   You don't know the half of the abuse..When Cupid knocks at your door   You can't ignore me!"
"We all don`t like waiting like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. @DATE1 @DATE1 @DATE1 when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. While still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for you flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have. To be patient in waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don’t like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do..Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,   Family values are contradicted..My Western world gives out her hand,   A victor's help to your fallen land..Continue hopefully?.My pulse was as high on my very first date!.Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?.If I did not have you?.Blues   Escape those weary   Twentieth century blues..So, she died...

"One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said “@CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later?” I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didn’t seem like much. When we got into the store that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said “@CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?” “I’ll try”. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said “@CAPS4 you for your patients”. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said “Do you see what happens if you be patient?” I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient..A warm dry wind is all that breaks the silence,   The highways quiet scars across the land..Oh baby I love you..Dreams, beautiful dreams   Dreaming of two   I used to never have these kind of dreams till you   You came along   And painted my nights, with all your love..I dream of heaven   I dream of heaven   I dream of heaven, yeah      High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man   And the love train rides from coast to coast   D.J..You said that you'd be true   Baby said that you'd be true   I don't care, I don't care   I don't care, I don't care   I don't want you   Don't want you   I don't want you anymore   You said that you'd be mine   Baby said that you'd be mine   I don't care, I don't care   I don't care, I don't care   I don't want you....I know all about you, your childhood days,   Your mom and dad, your pretty face..London with it's river and it's bridges?.(by Oasis)      Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday   I've got a lot of things to learn   Said I would and I believe in one day   Before my heart starts to burn..Black as your soul..And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much..I see your face,   And when you walk my way,   The violins   Always start to play,   And when you talk,   I don't care what you say,   It comes out I love you so,   Anyway, you should know   You make me   Think I'm listenin' to a symphony,   You make me   Hear the beauty of your poetry!.You are like the water."
" My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept haveiry mastakes with it like they spelled her last name wrong so it had to be called back and retiped everytime they retipped it they would make a mastakes five times in a row and it takes a long time to prosses and we needed to pay our pills so we wouldn’t get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow. When my grandma finally got her check we went strait out and got a brand new car. and clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to re do it over five time I know it wouldn’t be able to be that patient without loseing  it..I don't need to fight,   To prove I'm right,   I don't need to be forgiven..Looking up to the sky,   Made me realize,   Made me want to fly..Each of us is chosen   There's a mission just for you   Just look inside   You'll be surprised   What you can do      The power of one!.Yeah   Do you wanna touch?.I heard the news,   There's good rockin' tonight..Yeah what?.[Chorus: x2].Down in Mississippi where the sun beats down from the sky   They give it up and they give it up and they give it up   But they never ask why   Daddy was a rollin', rollin' stone   He rolled away one day and he never came home      It ain't hard to understand   This ain't Hitler's master plan   What it takes to be a man   In my mind, in my brain   I roll it over like a steamin' freight train   It ain't hard to ascertain      You only see what you want to believe   When you light up in the back with those tricks up your sleeve   That don't mean I can't hang   But the day that I die   Will be the day that I shut my mouth and put down my guitar   Sunday morning hold church down at the bar   Get down on your knees and start to pray   Pray my itchy rash will go away      Back up y'all it ain't me   Kentucky Fried Chicken is all I see   It's a hellified way to start your day   If I make you cry all night   Me and daddy gonna have a fist fight   It ain't personal, it ain't me      I only hear what you told me to be   I'm a backward-ass hillbilly   I'm Dick Butkiss   You know I lie   I get mean, I'm a thief in the dark   I'm a ragin' machine   I'm a triple rectified ass son of a bitch   Rec-tite(tm) on my ass and it makes me itch   I can see for miles and miles and miles   My broken heart makes me smile      In my mind, in my brain   I go back and go completely insane   It ain't personal, it ain't me   If I make you cry I might   Be your daddy at the end of the night   Take a load from my big gun      You only see what you want to believe   When you creep from the back   I got tricks up my sleeve   Twenty four seven the devil's best friend   It makes no difference   It's all the same in the end.It's the one thing you can choose, oh!.The classroom cheat..Part of me believes in you,   You're someone I'm not sure of..I Feel Like Dancing The Night Away."
" Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that’s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else..One day I'm a mother   (One day I'm a mother)   One day I'm a lover   (One day I'm a lover)   What am I supposed to do?.(in foreign lands.).[?.I might be over my head   A little over my head but I kinda like it   This is not what I expected   A little over my head (over my head)but I kinda like it   Kinda like it      I might be over my head (hey hey)   A little over my head but I kinda like it   This is not what I expected   A little over my head but I kinda like it   Kinda like it      Oh   A little over my head   A little over my head, my head   A little over my head   Oh...

"My brother matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long.   We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matt’s girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those  couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matt’s girlfriend two dollars..Almighty God, my Redeemer,   My Hiding Place, my Safe Refugee,   No other name like Jesus,   No power can stand against You..I just want to see you a little more..If I'm that easy to forget..Sometimes I'm right then I can be wrong   My own beliefs are in my songs   A butcher, a banker, Jack Irons on drums   Makes no difference what group I'm in   I am everyday people      Then it's the blue ones who can't accept   The green ones for living with   The black ones tryin' to be a skinny one   Different strokes for different folks   And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby      Ooh sha sha   We gotta live together      I am no better and neither are you   We're all the same whatever we do   You love me you hate me   You know me and then   Still can't figure out the scene I'm in   I am everyday people      Then it's the new man   That doesn't like the short man   For being such a rich one   That will not help the poor one   Different strokes for different folks   And so on and so on scooby dooby dooby      Ooh sha sha   We got to live together      There is a yellow one that won't   Accept the black one   That won't accept the red one   That won't accept the white one      Different strokes for different folks   And so on and so on and   Scooby dooby dooby   Ooh sha sha   I am everyday people.Layin' in the after glow   I only

He was not, but I had remembered at that moment that he was a slow typer. He finished the next day. In had no problem with it because I had lots of time to type my paper.

"One time I was patient when I went to the dentist. When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got their we got checked in and there was alot of people there so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting I was sitting on the ground being really board. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn’t know. Finally the doctor called my name. So I went in then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor, then when she was done I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was working with a different patient but then he finally came then I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient..The doors are swinging wide open,   A positive attitude and the ilk in my pocket   Had a lot to do with my new found friend,   The Hilikus..We could be like two strings beating,   Speaking in sympathy...   What would we do without you?.Don'tcha think my love is true?.Oh, I never believed I'd be lonely like me....I had a run-in   Run around and run down   Run around a corner   Run smack into a tree      I had to move   Really had to move   That's why if you please   I am on my bended knees   Bertha don't you come around here anymore      Dressed myself in green   I went down to the sea   Try to see what's going down   Maybe read between the lines   Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling      Turned around to see   Heard a voice calling, calling, calling   You was comin after me   Back to me      I had to move   Really had to move   That's why if you please   I am on my bended knees   Bertha don't you come around here anymore      Ran into a rainstorm   Ducked into a bar door   It was all night pouring, pouring rain   But not a drop on me      Test me, test me   Why don't you arrest me?.Lo, true      Hold up, I can get your funnel   Pull your trigger, go and get your gun off   Gonna tie my hair up top   Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock   Keep it number 1, that's easy mathematics   Keep it number 1, baby, ain't no static   Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs   No brakes, go green, no red   If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head   Put it on you, I'm a need about 4-5 beds   Cause I love my papi      I didn't see it   But I see it now   I think I love you   And I need you now   Ain't had none like you in a while      I luh ya papi   I luh ya papi,   I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi   I luh ya luh papi,   I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi   I luh ya papi,   I luh ya papi, I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi   Yeah that my papi   I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi      I put it down for a brother like you   Give it to you right in the car, that's you   We can first give you some of this, that's you   And you're all that loving that J..Coming back home was like going to jail..Well you fight like the devil to just keep your head above water   Chained to whatever you got that you can't throw away   And you're shootin' through space on this river of life that you're ridin'   And it's whirling and sucking you deeper on down every day   So you turn to your trusty old partner to share some old feelings   And you find to your shock that your faithful companion is gone   And the truth slowly dawns that you're lost and alone in deep water   And you don't even know how much longer there is to go on   [ harmonica ]   Like an old Holy Bible you clung to through so many seasons   With the rules of survival in words you could still understand   When they prove something wrong you believed in so long you go crazy   And you're so close to folding the cards that you hold in your hand   Singing Holy Toledo I can't see the light anymore   All those horizon that I used to guide me are gone   And the darkness is driving me farther away from the shore   Throw me a rhyme or a reason to try to go on.What better measure of what you were doing here   Than what you can leave behind..KNIFE GRINDER      Knives!.Coz as anyone can see..      You are my saving grace (oo my saving grace)   You put me in my place (you put me in my place)   I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)   The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space   You are my saving grace   You are my saving grace      You are my saving grace   You put me in my place   I see your smiling face (I see your smiling face)   The clouds disappear, and blue skies fill the space   You are my saving grace   You are my saving grace   You are my saving grace.Forgetting me   I'd be good for them, I really would   They'd have someone who understood   Who'd always be around   And never let them down, I never could."
"Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4’s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!.Wish everybody would leave me alone, yeah   They're always calling on my telephone   When I pick it up there's no one there   So I walk outside just to take the air      Come on with me cruising down the street   Who knows what you'll see, who you might meet   This brave new world's not like yesterday   It can take you higher than the milky way      Now I'm blinded I can't really see, yeah   No more bright lights confusing me, no   Don't ask me why I'm feeling blue   Cause loving you is all I can do      Hey good-looking boys, gather around   The sidewalk papers gutter-press you down   All those lies can be so unkind,   They can make you feel like you're losing your mind      Street life   Street life   Street life   What a life      Back to nature boys, Vasser girls too   Watch what you say, or think, or do   Continental-style strasse girls might   But you know exactly if it's wrong or right      Education is an important key, yes   But the good life's never won by degrees, no   Pointless passing through Harvard or Yale   Only window shopping, it's strictly no sale      Week end starts Friday soon after eight   Your jet black magic helps you celebrate   You may be stranded if you stick around   And that's really something.Grab a banana   And a sultana   Rip them to pieces   With sticky fingers   Split the banana   Crush the sultana      All emotion   And with devotion   You put your hands in   What ya thinking?.It's all a game,   'Cause inside I'm just the same,   My fried egg makes me sick   First thing in the morning..Yesterday love was such an easy game to play..Have you seen this face?.What a joyous day      Silent night, holy night..A little bit louder   (Can I get a witness?).I'm putting down roots, I want to soak up sun and stay right here until my days are done..If you think that Hollywood   Didn't get what he deserved,   Call 808 kit to get served      (Scarface)   How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy, man?.We was so happy..I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home   Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City   And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home   I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother   I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long   I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home   Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City   From the letters that I write they think I'm fine   But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars   If only they could read between the lines   Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City   And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time   So I just think I'll take my foolish pride   And put it on a Southbound freight and ride   And go on back to the loved ones the ones that I left waitin' so far behind   I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home.(Niggas!!)"""

When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say ""stop your being patient.

"At time I wsa very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of a seven. I worked harder then @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept braking my wonderful creation.

She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""@CAPS1 be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy.

Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said “what kind do you want?” @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all. Then my said “stop listing to that music” @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched tv and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed.

"I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life..If I Can't Love Her      Beast:   And in my twisted face   There's not the slightest trace   Of anything that even hints of kindness   And from my tortured shape   No comfort, no escape   I see, but deep within is utter blindness      Hopeless   As my dream dies   As the time flies   Love a lost illusion   Helpless   Unforgiven   Cold and driven   To this sad conclusion      No beauty could move me   No goodness improve me   No power on earth, if I can't love her   No passion could reach me   No lesson could teach me   How I could have loved her and make her love me too   If I can't love her, then who?.[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]   Here we go again, it's the game we love   Sheets all over the floor and they laced

"It was the @DATE1 and I, @PERSON1, had applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I had applied in @DATE2 and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION2. From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day.  Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day.""

And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldn’t wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldn’t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, if its along time, but its also a good thing to do because it pays with every time..I've been catchin' a glance, do you like what you see?.Delirium      So she thinks she's got a new boyfriend   But the two of them have never met   She's already got his name tattooed   In a heart across her chest   With his pictures plastered on her wall   But he has never called   And even all her friends they say:   'You're living in delirium'      Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you live in delirium   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da      Secretly she's stalking him on the streets   Making sure she's one step behind   They even went to the movies together   Or at least they stood in the same line   She tells everyone he sends her flowers   And love letters he sends her too   And they talk on the phone for hours   It's obvious she's come on blue      Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you live in deliri   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you're livin' in delirium   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da      Every night you find her all alone   Fantasising about the brand new home   And she's waiting for the bells the ring a ding-a-ling   Oh, God, she's lost her mind   And her friends tell her all the time   That it's make-believe   This guy she sees it's her disease   She's living in delirium      She's so happy that she found someone   But she's still living in delirium   She's so happy that she found someone   But she's still living in delirium      Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you're livin' in delirium   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you're livin' in delirium   (She's so happy that she found someone   But she's still living in delirium)   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you're livin' in delirium   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you're livin' in delirium   (She's so happy that she found someone   But she's still living in delirium)   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you're livin' in delirium   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you're livin' in delirium   Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da   Babe, you're livin' in delirium.Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy   Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie   Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy   Shake the boogie said up jump the boogie.As I look at the letters   That you wrote to me   It's you that I am thinking of   As I read the lines   That to me were so dear   I remember our faded love      I miss you darlin' more and more everyday   As Heaven would miss the stars above   With every heartbeat I still think of you   And remember our faded love      As I think of the past   And all the pleasures we had   As I watch the mating of the doves   It was in the springtime   That you said good-bye   And I remember our faded love      I miss you darlin' more and more every day   As Heaven would miss the stars above   With every heartbeat I still think of you   And remember our faded love      And remember our faded love.Put on the red shoes that you like..My baby even left me, never said a word..You..Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?.The more that you see,   The less that you know..I stood inside Egyptian temples,   I looked into eternal gardens,   Lay on the shores of distant islands,   Listening to the sea birds song of joy..yeah!.Ho, ho, ho..."
"Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every mustle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crows. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And than I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stoped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn’t just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening..The neighbors came out   And they gathered about   Saying ""hey!.A glass of wine, a fast embrace..Do you feel alright?.Butterflies and zebras, fairy tales,   That's all she ever thinks about..Oh I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny   Who has gone far away now from me   Oh.I'm thinking tonight of my Jenny   And I wonder if she ever thinks of me?.Shadow face, Oh they say you're of his (grace)?,   With your hair and beard and singin' strange new songs..Well I'm ordinarily very shy   But I grinned at her as I ate my pie   Baby, you look good to me tonight   I thought I must be in a dream   When she asked me if I wanted cream   Baby, you look good to me tonight      All in all you know   It's not a bad life on the road   If you've got wheels to roll   And lucky stars above   Your destiny's your own   You go as far as you can go   And if there's time to sleep   There's time to make love      I came, I saw, I conquered   But I rode off in the sun   But I know the look she left with me   Keeps telling me she won   Her face is the only thing I see   Whispering those words of prophesy      I may come easy, but I don't come free   You're never gonna see the last of me   Baby, you look good to me tonight   I was born to love you now can't you see   Baby, you look good to me tonight   I'm ordinarily very shy   But I take the time to satisfy   Baby, you look good to me tonight.There are three things I do when my life falls apart   Number one I cry my eyes out and I dry up my heart   Not until I do this will my new life start   So that's the first thing that I do when my life falls apart..Sometimes I feel wherever I go, I leave no man's land behind   And God is a pet and the devil's a toy, and I'm a danger in your paradise   Here I go   Here I go   Sometimes I feel wherever I go, I leave crimson roses behind   With a toy in my hand and a pet at my side, I spread roses,   Roses in your paradise      Here I go, with a toy in my hand and a pet at my side, here I go   Here I go, I'm a danger in your paradise      And life is a pretty, impolite bastard   I spit at you, I spit at you, I spit at you, bastard   I want to cut out your chameleon tongue   I'm a danger in your paradise      Here I go....A thorn in my side   A chip on my shoulder   A lump in my throat   The size of a boulder   The chill up my spine   Can't get any colder   And you wonder why I can't smile      A knot in my gut   An ape on my back   In the heat of the moment   I'm knocked off the track   You drop the ball   I pick up the slack   And you ask me why my hair's gray      Twisting, turning   Losing all sense of yearning   Living and learning   The pressure keeps on   Burning my soul (burning my soul)   Burning my soul (burning my soul)   Burning my soul (burning my soul)      I say it's green   And then you tell me it's red   Keep your thoughts and ideas   Locked inside of your head   We've got someone   Who can think for you instead   And he sounds just like the last one      Twisting, turning   Losing all sense of yearning   Living and learning   The pressure keeps on   Burning my soul (burning my soul)   Burning my soul (burning my soul)   Burning my soul (burning my soul)   Burning my soul (burning my soul)   Burning my soul         Responsible thinkers   Throw caution to the wind   But I find myself   Speaking from within   I can't live my life   Walking on eggshells   To stay on your good side      Using your words   Controlling my life   Can't you see it's my words   That gives you your life   So I hurt your feelings   Well I'm really sorry   But I don't give a shit, no      Twisting, turning   Losing all sense of yearning   Living and learning   The pressure keeps on   Burning my soul (burning my soul) [Repeat: x7].The

"At one @CAPS2 in left you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient..Look at the size of my ears, pour it on..Nah, bitch, not even close!.Yea..Well, did you ever wake up in the morning?.Rip the core of your, world apart..To be the last to leave....This is just a nightmare   Soon I'm gonna wake up   Someone's gonna bring me 'round      Running from the bombers   Hiding in the forest   Running through the fields   Laying flat on the ground      Just like everybody   Stepping over hills   Running from the underground      This is your warning   4 minute warning      I don't wanna hear it   I don't wanna know   I just wanna run and hide      This is just a nightmare   But soon I'm gonna wake up   Someone's gonna bring me 'round      This is our warning   4 minute warning.So it made no sense why she did that for the hell of it   We did it on the wall, me and my dogg   And I met her at the mall   Lakewood, so good, when I be inside of you   I'm just tryna freak it, make it fly for you   Make you want to come back and get another piece   And share with your peoples and tell your little niece   My khackis every crease with the rubber in my pocket   Ride it, divide it, and please don't knock it til you tried it      [Chorus:]   A brother sayin hi to you   I want to be inside of you   I know I'm lookin fly to you   I wouldn't lie to you, what'cha tryna do   A brother sayin hi to you   You know I wouldn't lie to you   I want to be inside of you   And after I do, goodbye to you      [Verse 2:]   Ay ay, baby who with cause your thang like tendin girl   Get it wit your fit in, and welcome to my world   Fancy cars, yachts n pools, basketball courts that's made for high schools   Backyard full of dogs, got a pawn full of fish   But a bad girl, I think that's all that's missin from my list   Unless you want to be the girl that fill that void-acap.Does anybody know bout love   Does anybody care bout God   If you're with me sing sorrow      Penny for your thoughts I fear   we need a little help round here   If you're with me sing sorrow      I don't understand here   Why God would do me this way..Cavaradossi   Brava!....Ghost rider motorcyle hero   Baby baby baby baby he's a screamin' away   Like the star star stars in the universe..And I'm so sick of sickness yeah   Why do I write the songs so dickless yeah."
" In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time..You got into my life   I don't know how you found me, but you did   It stopped me heading someplace else      Took me a while to say   Wish you belong to me   But now I'm saddened like I've never been   Regretting that we'll leave      And for a while you could comfort me   And hold me for some time   I need you now to be beside me   While all my world is so untidy      Loneliness (oh-o-oh)   Empty faces (oh-o-oh)   Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)   In someplace else      (Someplace else)      I hope you won't let go   Maybe you'll let me know   That you'll be saddened like you've never been   Regretting that we'll leave      And for a while I could comfort you   And hold you in my mind   I need you now to be beside me   While all my world is sad and crazy      Loneliness (oh-o-oh)   Empty faces (oh-o-oh)   Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)   In someplace else      And for a while you could comfort me   And hold me for some time   I need you now to be beside me   While all my world is so untidy      Loneliness (oh-o-oh)   Empty faces (oh-o-oh)   Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)   In someplace else      Loneliness (oh-o-oh)   Empty faces (oh-o-oh)   Wish I could leave them all (o-oh)   In someplace else      (Someplace else)      I think I'm gonna leave them all   In someplace else.I am a chorus of

"One time I had to use patience when we were driving to @CAPS1. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (@NUM1 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @NUM4 ocklock @CAPS2 time and,in @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am.  I was very tired of being patient, I’m not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!.Another bridge I have burned   A lesson I learned   One more mistake to my cause   One more hand got lost   In a game   So I was up for awhile   Livin' in style   Feelin' high on the hog      I was down      [Chorus]   Now some say I lost   His other soul   How barely a young man   Can sink so low   And I don't know, don't care at all      I had a similar dream   Of my dreams while   I thought I had wandered a mile   I was wrong      Now I'm on the way up   When you reach the top   No way to go   And people just don't want to know   When you're down.I got what you need, read between the lines girl you know what I mean..Hey!.You fell into our arms..[Chorus]   Was a sunny day   Not a cloud was in the sky   Not a negative word was heard   From the people passing by   Was a sunny day   All the birdies in the trees   And the radio's singing song   All the favorite melodies      He was a navy man   Stationed in Newport news   She was a high school queen   With nothing left to lose      [Chorus]      Her name was Lorelei   She was his only girl   She called him Speedoo   But his christian name   Was Mr. Earl      [Chorus].[Chorus: x2]   It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)   I'm up all night but everything is alright (It's alright)   It's a rough week and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)   It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)      One day I plan to be a family man happily married   I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried   'Til I'm glad to be buried   And leave this crazy world      And have at least a half a million for my baby girl   It may be early to be planning this stuff   'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough   'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough      I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed   My hands have been cuffed   But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff   Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts      I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough   And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see   My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased   With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese      I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call   Way before my baby is able to crawl   I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates   To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades      I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth   Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Kyu      [Chorus: x2]      I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps   Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep   Praying for sleep   Dreaming with a watering mouth      Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse   In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts   With the root of all evil   I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful      And make them do shit illegal   For these Grant's and Jackson's   These transactions explain a man's actions   But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity      Through God and there's a wish he granted me   He showed me how to cope with the stress   And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed   Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest      To selling dope with the rest   I quit smoking cess to open my chest   Life is stressful inside this cesspool   Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel      My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics   He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts   Kids attract static, children with automatics   Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets      I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum   I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum   It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth   But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth      [Chorus: x2]      Uh, it's OK, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep   Uh yeah, it's OK, it's alright, I can't sleep.Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true   When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?.(The new number two)

"Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who “claims” to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times.

"One time when I was patient was when I was fishing. We where fishing on a cold night and no fish where bighting,. I was just @CAPS1 ther being patient caling sun flower  seeds. My dad was getting mad and I was still @CAPS1 listning  to the backeasard  celtcs  games.  We where only catching little fish that night nuthing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didn’t have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear.

"Patience is a hard thing to have, but there is rewards to having it. I had a teacher that no one could remember to gave us our report card in band class. So after a few weeks I made a bet with him that if he didn’t bring us our report card the next day he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally. It was the end of the year. And he still didn’t have them. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said?? yes are only suppose to give me and  he told me “ the second one is ? being to patient.”.The disappointed   Will bear me on their shoulders   To a

"Patience is a valuable thing. Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do @CAPS1 practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It take patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn’t when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting..Oh, smokin',   Oh, baby, you're burnin'   Oh, baby, it's boilin', ah..Simple Obsession   (What about us)   (What about us)   (What about us)   (What about us)   (What about us)      What about us   Let's think about tomorrow   With you not in my life   What about love   As I try to make it every day   I live even for the day   Out of what you go   For it's hard to say goodbye      My simple obsession   (What about us)   (What about us)   (What about us)   I don't know what I'm gonna do without you   (What about us)   (What about us)   What about it   (What about us)   My simple obsession      What about love   Everyday I'm fighting from this pain   I'm doin' everything to be alright   What about love   As my beating heart keeps tellin' me   I don't want nobody in live but you   I don't want to go   For it's hard to say goodbye      My simple obsession   (What about us)   (What about us)   (What about us)   I don't know what I'm gonna do without you   (What about us)   (What about us)   What about love   (What about us)   My simple obsession      (What about us)   (What about us)   (What about us)   (What about us)   My simple simple simple obsession   My simple simple simple obsession   My simple simple simple obsession   My simple simple my simple obsession   (What about us)   What about love   What about live   I don't know what I'm gonna do without you   (What about us)   What about it   What about it   What about love   What about live   What about pain   What about love   (What about us)   (What about us)   Oh my simple obsession   (What about us).Black hope shot down   There's a gun in his hand   That souls divine   There's a hole in his head..Where the good times gone?.I'm asking once again..She has her eyes on medallion men   Who get her home on the dot at ten,   She combs her hair when she gets excused   The deal she wants always ends up screwed..Master!....It's here the family's broken   And it's here the lonely say   That the heart has got to open   In a fundamental way,   Democracy is coming to the U.S.A..And I do   The realest in my age group, no shit   Soho, cosmo, bob mar blow fish?.We were strangers, for way too long..To stay alive   She taught me to survive   In the face of every trial..Hey, we make the beat go   All night, all night, all night   Hey, I might be crazy but I'm   All right, all right      Work our toosh way to the front of the line (the line)   Bouncers gonna let us in 'cause we're fine (so fine)      Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey (hey), hey (hey), hey (hey), hey   I wanna see the bottles poppin'   Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey (hey), hey   I wanna see, I wanna see, I wanna see the bottles poppin'      I wanna see the bottles poppin'"
"When I was about seven And my mom was pregnant with my @NUM1 sister. It was the night before she had her. We were all asleep. When my mom started to scream we all went into her room my dad asked her what was going on she said “she coming” my dad raced to the car put it in to gear and left without us and my mom who was about to have a baby. Then when my dad relized he forgot us. So when he got home to pick us up. It was already morning they took us to a room. They prepared my mom up. Me amd my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the deveiring room we were so paitient it took over an hour to get her out. when they were stiching my mom up the brought my little sister to get all cleand up. When we could see her through the window. I had to see her get her first bath, shots And when the put those patches on her I had thought she was an @CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. And we all liked that name. I was so @CAPS3 that day..Waterfall   Nothing can harm me at all   My worries seem so very small   With my waterfall      I can see   My rainbow calling me   Through the misty breeze   Of my waterfall      Some people say   Daydreaming's for all the   Lazy minded fools   With nothin' else to do   So let them laugh, laugh at me   So just as long as I have you   To see me through   As long as I have you      Waterfall   Don't ever change your ways   Fall with me for a million days   Oh, my waterfall.Stretch your arms across the storm..It's who we are..I mean can you imagine?.I don't know why she's ridin' so high,   She ought to think twice,   She ought to do right by me..We go!.[Chorus:]   As long as Niagara falls,   As long as Gibraltar stands,   'Til Hell freezes over   I'll always be your man..I never knew of heartache   'Til I messed with you   I sure do sitting here   And feeling all the pain   I just can't sleep now   'Cause I'm hoping that you'll keep   Another heartache for my heart again      My mama taught me   How to read from the good book   My papa taught me   How to win and lose a game   They went down smiling   'cause they left me all they had   Plus another heartache for my heart again      [Chorus:]   But now it's fine, fine, fine   'Cause you're with me all the time   There to care and share the things I do   And now it's fine, fine, fine   'Cause you're with me all the time   Everywhere and even nowhere too      I use to make the late nights   On a cheap weekend   But all the women there were   Just a crying shame   I heard them saying   That they didn't think I'd stop   For another heartache for my heart again      [Chorus]   But now it's fine, fine, fine   'Cause you're with me all the time   There to care and share the things I do   And now it's fine, fine, fine   'Cause you're with me all the time   Everywhere and even nowhere too.I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm..Move your whole body and let's start the party   As soon as my album goes number one   Mr. Lim I'd like a Rolex with forty diamonds, ha ha ha.Or maybe one of those new digital frames   What does he want?.(spoken)   Uh, that hurt man   Alright   Perfect"
"Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!.Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker,   But I gives a fuck, cause I'm going deep cover..Fishing for salmon   Losing at backgammon..All days come from one day   That much you must know,   You cannot change what's over   But only where you go      One way leads to diamonds,   One way leads to gold,   Another leads you only   To everything you're told..You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt   You'll drink as slow, love twice and you'll get fucked..What if there's always cups in the sink?.I ask you, do you want to come and play?.you think you know just what it means to be alone you think you've suffered for your cause you're wrong i don't really need to know what makes you tick or what you think is right i don't want to know the reason you believe right now you're like the others your thoughts are not your own try thinking for yourself and act on what you know still you try to defend these things you were taught you've got to try to change the way you learn sometimes it feels just like i've burned every single bridge that i have ever crossed i always try to learn from all of these mistakes mistakes that i have made but pride is a worthy adversary in the struggle for yourself.We're off to see the Wizard,   The wonderful Wizard of Oz..Saigon, it was all gone   The same Coke machines   As the streets I grew on   Down in a mesquite canyon   We come walking along the ridge   Me and the brothers under the bridge      Campsite's an hour's walk from the nearest road to town   Up here there's too much brush and canyon   For the CHP choppers to touch down   Ain't lookin' for nothin', just want to live   Me and the brothers under the bridge   Come the Santa Ana's, man, that dry brush'll light   Billy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night   We buried his body in the white stone high up along the ridge   Me and the brothers under the bridge      Had enough of town and the street life   Over nothing you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife   Now I don't want no trouble   And I ain't got none to give   Me and the brothers under the bridge      I come home in '72   You were just a beautiul light   In your mama's dark eyes of blue   I stood down on the tarmac, I was just a kid   Me and the brothers under the bridge      Come Veterans' Day I sat in the stands in my dress blues   I held your mother's hand   When they passed with the red, white and blue   One minute you're right there ... and something slips...      msa.Feeling the pressure from all the things I gotta face today..Lets go boys..I thought I'd give my love to anyone today   But when it came to you one thing was for sure   Well I know your little games and I don't want to play   It's like takin' sick when nobody knows the cure   You come on like the princess of the junior prom   Always part of everything that's going down   Just looking for another fool to lean upon   In the center ring and everyone's your clown      Can't you see I've lost my nerve   I just can't face you   Perhaps I'll let the time erase you   Can't you see I've lost my nerve   I just can't face you   Perhaps I'll let the time erase you      I thought I'd give my love to anyone today   But when it came to you one thing was for sure   Well I know your little games and I don't want to play   It's like takin' sick when nobody knows the cure"
"A time I was patient! Being patient is all about being tolerant and under standing. Sometimes when @CAPS6 in a bad mood I have @CAPS9 be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset it was buring @DATE1 vacation and my little sister @ORGANIZATION1 wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream tank that rade by every twenty minuts frome the ice-cream shop which was about seven @CAPS9 ten block away. I was bund @CAPS3 in my blanket when she jumped @CAPS3 on @CAPS9 my bed. “@CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I want @CAPS9 go get ice-cream. @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!!!” @CAPS5 I said in a mean voice. @ORGANIZATION1 you little hob –goblen get off my bed OR @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 YOU @CAPS9 A @CAPS10!!! I was younger and in a terrible mood that crying is sound so sill and stuped. Tears came @CAPS9 her eyes and I didn’t realize at that moment that she was little (fore years old) and didn’t quite understand that I didn’t fell good. I apologized and explained that I was sick. Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said “I made mama make you some tea”. That was hart warming @CAPS9 me. After I drank it @ORGANIZATION1 asked if I felt better. I said a little then @ORGANIZATION1 got @CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and new that she didn’t fully understand yet. So I got @CAPS3 and took her @CAPS9 the ice-cream shop @CAPS9 get some ice-cream. @ORGANIZATION1 was happe ans that made me happe. I fell extremely proud that I was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 eve whe she got on me nerves. I know I was n’t patient with @ORGANIZATION1 at the “beginning” but at the end I was..Cette nuit      Glory Glory Alleluia   Glory Glory Alleluia   Glory Glory Alleluia   Chantons chantons No?.You say you want everything good for me,   But I know so well, I can tell when you're lying..Green sleeves, you're all alone      Green sleeves, you're all alone,   The leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home..I.O.I.I.I.I.I.O.I.O..Long ago we were strollin' together   All the shores and the drive-in's we did see   Now she spends all her time with another   But I wonder if she ever thinks of me?.If you gave me nine lives like a tommy cat   I'd give 'em all to you and never take one back      Ain't that loving you baby?.Over the line can't define what I'm after   I always turn the car around   Give me a break let me make my own pattern   All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered   I always turn the car around      Give it up, give it up, baby   Give it up, give it up, now   Now      How many times can I break till I shatter?.O come let us adore Him..Wasn't I the one,   Love never came to?.Ecco ora mai, il momento temuto da tempo, sai   Gia so quello che mi dirai, e la fine di noi..(Yeah, uh) Don't leave your girl around me   True playa fo' real, ask my nigga Pharrell uh   (Let 'em know)      Situations, will arise   In our lives   But U gotta to be smart about it   Cele-brations with the guys   I sacrificed   'Cause I knew U could not sleep without it   Meanwhile I, I   I loved U   U were my girl   U see I, I,   Thought the world of U   But you're still steady leavin' baby      U don't have to call   It's okay girl   'Cause I'mma be alright tonight      U don't have to call   It's okay girl   'Cause I'mma be alright tonight      Aw girl your face is   Sayin' why   Tears in eyes   Should've been more smart about it   Should've cherished me   Listenin' to friends, now it's the end   Then again, no story can end without it   Damn right,   I loved U   You were my girl   U see I, I,   Thought the world of U   But you're still steady leavin' baby yeah yeah      U don't have to call   It's okay girl   'Cause I'mma be alright tonight      U don't have to call   It's okay girl   'Cause I'mma be alright tonight      Gonna boogie tonight   'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy   To stay home   Waitin' for love   So tonight   I'm gonna do what a single man does   And that's party!.for you girls and boys   want to be a member, want to have some fame   Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game   Combat authority but don't get out of line   Or they'll put you in the slammer you'll be doing some time   714 tattooed on my head   I find myself labeled that I'm a victim instead   I fight all the rules I don't see the way   I'd rather be dead then pay the price that they say   'cause O.C."
"The time I was patient was whene I went to the @CAPS1.B.I @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of training, he was there for like @NUM1 months. At the end if they made  it through they got a award. So there was kind of a lot of  people. We had to dress really nice. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didnt even know. The worst part was they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave.

"This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me..Flies are buzzing round my head   Vultures circling the dead   Picking up every last crumb   The big fish eat the little ones   The big fish eat the little ones   Not my problem, give me some      You can try the best you can   If you try the best you can   The best you can is good enough   If you try the best you can   If you try the best you can   The best you can is good enough      This one's optimistic   This one went to market   This one just came out of the swamp   This one dropped a payload   Fodder for the animals   Living on animal farm      If you try the best you can   If you try the best you can   The best you can is good enough   If you try the best you can   If you try the best you can   The best you can is good enough      I'd really like to help you, man   I'd really like to help you, man   Nervous messed up marionettes   Floating around on a prison ship      If you try the best you can   If you try the best you can   The best you can is good enough   If you can try the best you can   If you try the best you can   Dinosaurs roaming the earth   Dinosaurs roaming the earth   Dinosaurs roaming the earth.So we meet again, my long lost friend   Once again, we get to start anew,   And it feels like a thousand years,   I've been loving you..Oh, there's gotta be a better way..Come on rainy Jane,   It's up to you to make your own sweet sunshine..Au revior, fare-thee-well and goodbye..""Aba, daba, daba, daba, daba, daba, dab,""   Means ""Monk, I love but you."".The happier you fly   The sadder you fall   The laughter in your eyes   Is never all..I've felt this pain before..I hide behind these words,   And think of all the places   Where you've been lost,   And found out..It says   'I live in nightmares   I'm the new god of panic   And I'm waiting for you to come home to me..Now we've just begun..I got a agent in Cologne."
"Patience, whats the first word that comes to your mind when you hear that word? Waiting? I know that’s the main word in my mind. Here is a story when I was very patient. Every kid dreads meap testing it was @DATE1 and we have to be completely silent. It’s hard enough to be quite. But it’s harder when your next to your friends, and your a girl. We had to do meap writing, writing is the most wrost for me. But when I was done I felt really good and quiet for everyone else. That’s the story when I had to be patient..I, I long for the moment   When I see you again   I long to touch and stroke your hair again   Though my heart goes on beating not knowing when      I, I wait for the time   I feel your hair once more through these hands of mine   My heart will sing, you know I will soar   Just like before, just like before      Chorus:   Until then   All I'll have is just a memory of you   That I could hold on to   Until then   All I'll have is just this space and time   To wait and think of you   Coz you'll be on my mind   Until then (until then)      I, I wait for the time   I feel your hair once more through these hands of mine   I know that someday, you'll come back and stay      We'll be together once more   Just like before      Until then   All I'll have is just a memory of you   That I could hold on to   Until then   All I'll have is just this space and time   To wait and think of you   Coz you'll be on my mind   Until then...      Bridge:   I long for the moment   I long for the time   I'll take all my chances   Until you are mine      All I'll have is just a memory   That I could hold on to   Until then   All I'll have is just this space and time   To wait and think of you   Coz you'll be on my mind...

"There is many ways to be patient like while your wating in the lunch line to pat or when you line up to leav the room. Heres a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was talking to some and I wanted to go right away but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient..Can the child within my heart rise above?.But longer be - be - be bound   Here we go!.Nobody else to be this hard   Go this!.Get off of that couch   Turn off that M.T.V....Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue..I hear the beast a-coming   To get another load   Of fire and brimstone   Do you wanna go?.Who'll come and get me when I have fallen through the cracks?.Do you remember me?).I just can't fit   Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit   When we meet again, introduced as friends   Please don't let on that you knew me when   I was hungry and it was your world      Oh, she takes just like a woman   Yes she does   And she makes love just like a woman   She aches just like a woman   Yeah, takes just like a woman   Yeah, makes love just like a woman.One thing, I have learned through   these years,   Is that no man, should be stricken   with fear   It should be that he walks with no   care in the world..Get a gay?"
"To me,  patient is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. “Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?” I asked wondering if it would easy to get it. “@CAPS2 buddy we just ran out.” @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess I’ll have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didn’t grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort..Gang   There were only your friends who died, yeah?.I only miss you every now and then,   Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean..Riding on a humming bird's wing,   Caravans fleeing from the east..I'd like to think so   Standards of living   They're rising daily   But home oh sweet home   It's only a saying   From bell push to faucet   In smart town apartment   The cottage is pretty   The main house a palace   Penthouse perfection   But what goes on   What to do there   Better pray there      Open plan living   Bungalow ranch style   All of it's comforts   Seem so essential   I bought you mail order   My plain wrapper baby   Your skin is like vinyl   The perfect companion   You float my new pool   De luxe and delightful   Inflatable doll   My role is to serve you   Disposable darling   Can't throw you away now   Immortal and life size   My breath is inside you   I'll dress you up daily   And keep you till death sighs      Inflatable doll   Lover ungrateful   I blew up your body   But you blew my mind      Oh those heartaches   Dreamhome heartaches.Why do you always make a fool out of me?.Noon by the clock and so still by the dock   You can hear a foghorn miles away   And in that quiet of death, I'll say, ""Right now, right now!"".While my friends around me were calling, ""today, today, today, today."".Stick with us weirdos....Ha!.With his big brown eyes he came my way   I didn't know then what he had to say   I could tell that he felt bad   By the way he looked that he felt sad, oh yeah      Sometimes you hurt me baby, I don't know why   I'll always love you baby till the day I die   But when you look at fellas   Baby I get jealous   I only live my life for you   Anything you say I'll do   I'll live for you, I'll die for you   I'll even climb the mountains high for you      Thought right then he'd break my heart   I could feel the teardrops start   Why didn't he know I love him so   I could never let him go, oh no      I'd never hurt you baby, tell you why   I'm gonna love you till the day I die   When I look at fellas   Baby don't get jealous   I only live my life for you, anything you say I'll do   I'll live for you, I'll die for you   I'll even climb the mountains high for you      I love you, just you, nobody else but you   I love you, only you,every day, every day, just you.Can you feel my   Dirty desire?"
" Patients  to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @NUM1 then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid.  But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time..Could this be magic,   Or could this be love?.Temples of greed   In ruins on the river bed   Wastelands that lived before the snow   Time stands still   As we race through the universe   On our way to the sun   And as we arrive at the house   Of the water sign   We're living in strange times   Strange times   Strange times   It's you and I forever   We won't be afraid   Even if the stars are falling down   Down, down, down, down   Falling down   Time stands still   As we race through the universe   On our way to the sun   And as we arrive at the house   Of the water sign   We're living in strange times   Strange times, strange times   Strange times, strange times   Strange times, strange times   Strange times, strange times   Strange times, strange times   Strange times, strange times.Let it blow, welcome home, welcome home..'Cause soon tha money left, she was fucking niggas daily???.If that's all there is, my friends,   Then let's keep dancing..Enough with the talk yeah, let's end this now,   I can sum it all up in just one word...      Owww!.Missed it by that much!.But if you'll really hold me tight   All the way home I'll be warm      The fire is slowly dying   And, my dear, we're still goodbying   But as long as you love me so   Let it snow!.I could feel the nearness of her warm, sweet kisses,   When you rolled into Alberta westward bound..When will I feel all soft on the inside?.And it's ""how are you kid?.Confusion,I leave it all up to you."
"Today was the first day I was patient. I couldn’t believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said “@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you don’t get this line moving then I’m going to have to talk to the waiterger. All the guy said “I’m so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before you”. “@CAPS2 are you kidding me” she yelled as she stopped way and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I’m inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said “Do deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be inpatient again..It felt so bad that I'm in pain   Then why don't I say no not again   Your love has failed and all's gone sour   You have to see her every hour   When you can't sleep your mind is blank   But you don't love no longer thinks   You lose the grip you thought you had   She smiles at you but you are sad   So if then heaven sees in you   Then suddenly its over, through   You take your life into your hands   Forgetting all your other plans      And your so sad you cut your wrists   And they can show you what they missed   You labor now a point in pain   But will your worst day ever end   When you lose or when you've gained   Don't give up, Don't start again   Your feelings burned like forest wood   You take you're life, you're gone for good   You'll miss her bed but not her brains   There is no need to mention names   My reasons strong that all has failed   Your face is blue you're looking pale   Love can kill you suck you down   Suicidal up -

"I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher’s or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I’d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one..They say you got in agony, the hand fits well into the glove..This is where they all   Throw me to the wolves   Dragged behind and trampled on   I can't keep clawing at the jaws of hell   The silence is killing me      Nothing to calm the nerve   Nothing to calm the nerve   Write down my thoughts   And read me my rights   Repeat, repeat, repent and repeat      The cycle never really ends   Till they admit that it's real   The cycle never really ends   Till they admit, they admit that it's real      Everything, everything is leaving me wondering   I hate that I'm questioning everything, everything      This is how it seems to me   I've drowned myself in self-regret   This is how I wanna be   This can't be how I wanna be      This is spinning perfect little circles   And that's all that they know   They just spin in perfect little circles   And that's all that they know, all that they know      [Repeat x3]   Nothing's right, just left alone   Sinking in will be just fine   None of them will ever know   None of them will ever know.Bury bones?.So, baby, come on in..Grain of sand in traffic jam, and I'm late..I get a little bitty tingle   Up and down my spine   My head gets dizzy   Every time you say you're mine..What makes you feel like doin' stuff like that?.But take the time, my memory fails,   And soak my eyes in the morning rain,   Like a sailor, sailing over Jordan,   On the road back home again..It's my girl   (My girl, my girl)   You know that I'm talkin' 'bout my girl   (My girl)      I've got so much honey, you know the bees envy me   Got a sweetest song that I can sing   The birds in the trees   Oh but I guess you'll say   What can make me feel this way?.They give us a room   with a view of the beautiful Rhine   They give us a room   with a view of the beautiful Rhine   Gimme a muddy old creek   in Texas any old time      I've got those hup, two, three, four   occupation G.I..You're in the past   We've all grown up   Without your help, though   I never would've thought   That I could be whatever,   Beyond my hopes and dreams   But you need to know   I'm gonna go my own way...      Can't believe what's happened   Through the years....Come back, baby."
"Patience is being able to wait for something. For some, patience is hard and for some its easy. For me, I'm ok at patience. Like I'm patiencet for this game I pre-ordered. It comes out @DATE1.

"I have exprienced patients when I went to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 hour strip, we were in a small car and we were a little caradable because we didn’t sleep very well last night even though I brought a book & my @ORGANIZATION1 game we were still pretty bored. All I did watch trees after my battery end on my @ORGANIZATION1. Dad was considtrated on the road, mom finally and license plates to see travelers. Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you could hear, mom, @CAPS1 and my stomagh growling, we didn’t stop. We had to get to @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotels front desk shut down. At @NUM3 we were crushing through the state of @LOCATION1 to then arive at @TIME1 at the hotel we were so excited that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes in the bed..arta-ma, iubeste-ma   Crede-ma,   Oricat vei iubi   Nu vei iubi ca mine!.sniffing the wind for something new..I try to reason and tell myself you'll return   But you are gone and I know, I know, I know you're gone   You were mine for only a minute   And if I hurt you I didn't intend it      You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind   You're not gonna stay   But I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby   I lost you, baby, you were gone      Forgive and forget it that's not what I'll ask you to do   'Cause I want you back, yeah   You know, you know I want you back   And in concluding my mental discussion   I found I lost my prized possession      You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind   You're not gonna stay   And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby   I lost you, baby, you were gone      You were mine for only a minute   And if I hurt you I didn't intend it      You are gone away, I keep tellin' my mind   You're not gonna stay   And I believe sometimes that I lost you, baby   I lost you, baby and you were gone      Lie, lies I told you baby   I never meant to say      But a desperate mind   Does a desperate thing baby   I can't loose you   I do whatever I got to do      I never loved like this before   I don't mean to be so silly   Such a little girl sometimes   I really want to be your woman   I just....I've been sittin' back quietly,   Watchin' as my spirit fades..Please dontcha do it to me, babe, no!.Chip it..I love you more each day!.[2x]      We get colder,   As we grow older..The girl from the canyon smiled a smile that brought me home   As sick and bleeding as I was she took me on her own   Brought me to the canyon where the sun poured down like rain   Her smiling eyes and the mountain light I thought myself insane   These hills have seen me runnin' till my horse could hardly stand   Hidin' by day in the mountains movin' with the moon on the land   I'm hoping to find my freedom in a world that wants me dead   The girl from the canyon took and healed my wounds instead   The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I had done   She laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun   The girl from the canyon the girl from the canyon she was the only one   An outlaw is a hunted one with aprice upon his head   We're all outlaws in a way that is what she said   And so I left the canyon when I was strong enough to ride   The girl from the canyon she was riding by my side   The girl from the canyon      She was the only one.When I cross that bridge,   It'll be as if this don't exist..A country girl in Paris, moonlight on the Seine   Memories of Tennessee, Nashville in the rain   It's such a contradiction, a heart that's filled with pain   A country girl in Paris, dreamin' Nashville in the rain      She walks along the boulevard, Champs Alysee   Thinks about a country boy three thousand miles away   Pride is such a hard thing, it's such a price to pay   To be all alone in Paris with true love so far away      Up upon Mont Martre when she stops to rest awhile   All the artists look at her and they long to paint her smile   For even in her sorrow there's something in her eyes   That makes the young men jealous, makes the old men sigh      They say the loss of innocence is always linked to pain   For once the heart is opened nothing ever is the same   And so the evening lends itself to lovers and romance   The way to heal a broken heart is to give true love   One more chance      A country girl in Paris, moonlight on the Seine   Memories of Tennessee, Nashville in the rain   It's such a contradiction, a heart that's filled with pain   A country girl in Paris, dreamin' Nashville in the rain   A country girl in Paris, longing for Nashville in the rain..I'll be home for christmas      I'll be home for christmas   You can count on me   Please have snow, and mistletoe   And presents, by the tree      Christmas Eve will find me   Where the love light, gleams   I'll be home for christmas   If only in my dreams      Christmas Eve will find me   Where the love light, gleams   I'll be home for christmas   If only in, if only in,      If only in my, Dreams"
"Being patient, what does it mean? It means that; “you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn’t complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn’t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn’t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn’t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!.I need to find a place to hide   You never know what could be   Waiting outside   The accidents you could find   It's like some kind of suicide      So what ails you is what impales you   I feel like I've been crucified to be satisfied      I'm a victim of my symptom   I am my own worst enemy   You're a victim of your symptom   You are your own worst enemy   Know your enemy      I'm elated   Medicated   I am my own worst enemy   So what ails you is what impales you   You are your own worst enemy   You're a victim of the system   You are your own worst enemy   You're a victim of the system   You are your own worst enemy.You are my love and earth to me..I'm coming to get you, oh yeah..Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna back up against the wall   Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna run till I have to crawl   Sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothin' at all   But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said   Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you..Do, do, do, do you even care,   Angel?.Making me blue      I'm afraid some day you're gonna leave me   Saying, why can't we still be friends?.Hold on to your love..Will it be the same   In a time in the future?.Now I know none of this was planned, it all just kinda happened   I got more than I wanted, but how is still a mystery   Obsessed with this feeling, I trusted it, so I followed it   I'm tripping and stumbling across the land, full of miracles   Into a world so far from home, miles and miles from nowhere   Rooms without doors open for me, oh no   Taking me miles and miles from nowhere   Oh (miles and miles), oh yeah   Lost in this pleasure dome, lost in my own pleasure dome   Oh man, I ain't got a clue, how you get out, or how to find this place   I want my control back, but I'm afraid, I'll lose that feeling   Lost in a world so far from home, I'm miles and miles from nowhere   Falling inside my own pleasure dome, I'm miles and miles from nowhere   Oh (miles and miles), oh yeah   Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome      Lost in a world, can't find my way home, miles and miles from nowhere   Falling inside my own pleasure dome, miles and miles from nowhere   Millions of miles, oh no, miles and miles and miles from nowhere   Miles and miles and miles and miles, oh   Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome, yeah   Lost, lost.You haven't changed a bit   Lovely as ever I must admit      Oh, what's new?.Who were you?.Do you remember   Standing on the shore,   Head in the clouds,   Your pockets filled with dreams   Bound for glory   On the seven seas of life,   But, the ocean is deeper than it seems      The wind was with you   When you left on the morning tide,   You set your sail for an island in the sun,   On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead,   For the storm has just begun      Take me with you,   Take me far away,   Lead me to the distant shore      Sail your ship across the water,   Spread your wings across the sky   Take the time to see   You're the one who holds the key,   Or sailing ships will pass you by      You cry for mercy,   When you think you've lost your way,   You drift alone, if all your hope is gone   So find the strength and you will see   You control, your destiny,   After all is said and done      So take me with you,   Take me far away,   An' lead me to the distant shore      Sail your ship across the water,   Spread your wings across the sky   Take the time to see   You're the one who holds the key,   Or sailing ships will pass,   Sailing ships will pass you,   Sailing ships will pass you by      Take me with you,   Take me far away,   We'll ride the wind across the sky   Spread your wings and you will see   You control, your destiny,   So sailing ships don't pass you by      So take me with you,   Take me far away,   We'll ride the wind across the sky   Spread your wings and you will see   You control, your destiny,   So sailing ships don't pass,   So sailing ships don't pass you,   So sailing ships don't pass you by      Baby, baby, baby, baby,   You'll find that you're the only one   Can sail your ship across the sky"
"A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins won’t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldn’t think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue.”.And don't you know that girls will be girls   And I just wanna live any way that I want to   From either side of the fence vive la difference   So help me boys will be boys   Got your voice buzzing in my head and a rollercoaster down my spine   Well don't you know that boys will be boys....(hey, yeah)   Put on your hi-heel sneakers,   Slap your wig hat on your head..I won't give less you need it, just a bit could be overhead   I won't wait for a minute, can't hesitate   I won't wait for a minute, can't hesitate      Trust me to fall apart, trust you to know   Just you and no-one else, just me alone   Why did it have to be?.Blues Run the Game Lyrics   Written by Jackson C.

"I know a time when I was patient. My friend @PERSON1 was coming back to the football field after we scored a grant @NUM1. We were gonna hang out. It was two and a half hours before he got their. When he was there we both were patient to play the game or do what others wanted to do. AS the day progressed the sun was like a tanning booth. The grass was also as dry as cactus, but the day moved on. Finally when we went are own way.

lost, our lives it cost   Humans head for the sea   The Mites have won, until the sun   Rises up over the east, no more feast, for the beasts have deceased      Now my son you know of the Mega-Mites   100 years they'll be back to live at night   Tell your son to pass on the holy word   Or human life will be gone, it must be heard   Man is not the only one to rule the earth   Like he was in the past from the day of birth   The Mega-Mites are always in victory   Man is not, he goes home, back to the sea   Back to the sea, back to the sea, back to the sea.2nd chorus   Theres no need for me, to even try,   Nothin will turn out right,   When I lost your love, I lost the will to live,   And I'm lost, like a stranger in the night      3rd chorus   Like a broken heart, that's lost on lifes sea,   Tho I pray with all my might,   I know I can't face, to - morrow alone,   And I'm lost, like a stranger in the night..If ya ain't I'll tell ya one more time   You bet ya last dime   In all of the world so far   I am the greatest, greatest   Star!"
" My at saying your patient is. Your patient when you wait in line for something is being patient. Waiting your turn is being patience one time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play but I didn`t get to play until the fourth queiter with @NUM1 to go but you know what I did had patience. A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient. Am not saying all popstars and movie stars don`t have patient when they were little they never act like that..Ready to go?.Oh yeah!.I must admit, just when I think I'm king,   (I just begin.).Chorus   I never trusted happiness, as far as I could throw it,   Always preparing for the worst, 'cause I would know it,   All of that hammering in the dark, like a new noah working on his ark,   On his ark..You've got me achin' more than I should   My heart is breakin', oh don't it feel good   'Cause I know for certain, we're magic in love   You've got me hurtin, 'cause I can't get enough      I just couldn't say no even though I should   Even if I did, wonder if you could   I just couldn't say no when your eyes say yes, yes   I just can't say no, I've tried my best      The way you tease me makes me want you more   You purr like a kitten but I hear you roar   Your body language is talkin' to me   Right here in the darkness, it's so plain to see      I just couldn't say no even though I should   Even if I did, wonder if you could   I just couldn't say no, no, when your eyes say yes, yes   I just can't say no, I've tried my best, I just couldn't say no      I just couldn't say no, no, when your eyes say yes, yes   I just can't say no, I've tried my best   I just couldn't say no, I've tried my best      I just couldn't say no.I'd advise you to fix your self, for real,   And do your shit wit' more zeal..Like a carrot darling!.We used to say ""Ah Hell, we're young""   But now we see that life is sad..Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.All of a sudden, now baby, it's love..(children power)      Earth is turning ev'ry day,   Rivers are flowing in every way..The unclean man from the unclean land   Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest   Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless   Put a price on things, that are priceless   The fierceness that meanness is stronger than the niceness   Who really has the power, is is theirs, is it ours?"
"I remember a time when I was patient. I was so patient that the doctor gave me a sucker. I was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. He told me to wait a second, but I wasn’t waiting a second I was waiting for hours. My mom couldn’t wait any longer she was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would fill like time is going faster .She said, she is going to try, but if it didn’t work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. Me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat..We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver..I want somebody tell me,   How do I tell her, girl?.How can you stand there and deny it?.Don't ask me!.This ain't   No morning after..Would your tongue slip past my lips?.How did you get so long?.Some freedom..As I watched my mother die, I lost my head..Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome aboard the starship Boney M   for our first passenger flight to Venus..Pancho, Oh!.With Precious and Grace ev'rything's all right."

"A time when I am patient is at gymnastics. There is multiple ways you have to be patient at gymnastics. Your mind, and body have to be patient, and sometimes you have to be patient with the coach your mind has to be patient when you wish you do things but you really can`t. your body has to be patient when it feels like your ready to do a skill but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping. So sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes until they can finally help you.

"Being patient means that you are understand and tolerant a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. I’m writing about a time when my friend @PERSON1 was patient. “@CAPS1” @PERSON1 said to @ORGANIZATION1 as he was leaving to spend his whole @DATE1 in the upper pininusula of @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 were dating since the beginning of the year. She was sad @CAPS2 weeks had passed and @CAPS4 was the beginning of a new school year .She had been patient all @DATE1 @CAPS3 to see him again. Finally the first day of school came she skipped up to him and he @CAPS3 called a way .Couple of confused weeks late she said to him are you jumping  me or ???He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient waiting for an answer @CAPS4 never came. Finally she decided to jump him but, she never did.

This will take forever!” complained the person in front. “@CAPS3,shut up,man. I dont like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining? “exclaimed @CAPS1. Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. This was not a good sign. @CAPS1 stopped talking and just waited in line . After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music at  his ipod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the  front of the line. Then something bad happened. “@CAPS3 this isn’t my schedule!” said a blonde girl. The person who was giving  out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule. So @NUM1 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If @CAPS1 hadn’t patience,he wouldn’t have standed the @NUM4 minutes in line!

The people that work in cedses was trying because there a lot of people and everybody was lewing. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about the pizza.

"Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don’t. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!.So I say it's up to us to straighten   Out this mess...   We got to go through hell...

" One day me and my friend @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 to alabama. It was the most boring thing @CAPS3! Imagine just driving in a car for @NUM1 hours just driving and stopping to use the bathroom.

"A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well I get out of school at @TIME1 my dad gets at @TIME2So,if  I wanted his  help , I would have to wait myself  but I didn’t understand it. Even with homework that needed help on back in my backpack until my dad got home I wished the homework that didn’t need help on. After my homework   that which I did all my @CAPS1, then it was time to eat, as I ate my dinner. By that time I was done waiting my dad me, more and really to help we as my dinner. It was last to go to wait over my dad to help understand it so much more..It's as good as mine, It's as good as mine   It's as good as mine      As good as mine, as good as mine,   As good as mine, as good as mine      Where do we go, nobody knows   Don't ever say you're on your way down when   God gave you style and gave you grace   And put a smile upon your face.My father was reading, the holy books in his room,   My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,   He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,   I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare..There is a place we'll go   Where there is mostly quiet   Flowers and butterflies   A rainbow lives beside it      And from a velvet sky   A summer storm   You can feel the coolness in the air   But you're still warm      And then a mighty roar   Will start the sky to cryin'   But not even light'ning   Will be frightening my lion      And with no fear inside   No need to run   No need to hide   You're standing strong and tall   You're the bravest of them all      If on courage you must call   Then just keep on tryin'   And tryin', and tryin'   You're a lion   In your own way, be a lion      Come on be a lion      I am standing strong and tall   You're the bravest of them all   If on courage you must call   Keep on tryin'   And tryin', and tryin'   I'm a lion   In my own way   I'm a lion   A lion   A lion   A lion.You have danced with him since the music began..(Take my hand..If you don't believe I love you, look what a fool I've been   If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in..The more I see you as years go by   I know the only one for me can only be you   My arms won't free you, my heart won't try      I know the only one for me can only be you   My arms won't free you, my heart won't try.Far away places with strange-sounding names   Far away over the sea   Those far away places with the strange-sounding names   Are callin', callin' me      Goin' to China or maybe Siam   I want to see for myself   Those far away places I've been readin' about   In a book that I took from the shelf      I start getting restless whenever I hear   The whistle of a train   I pray for the day I can get underway   And look for those castles in Spain      They call me a dreamer, well, maybe I am   But I know that I'm burnin' to see   Those far away places with the strange-sounding names   Callin', callin' me.On the Chisholm Trail it was midnight Carmela was strong on his mind   Because of the life he had chosen Carmela had left then behind   Too long he'd been a bandito Carmela had left him alone   But today someone brought a message she'd be seen in old San Antone   Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn   Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone      He glanced back over his shoulder the posse were nowhere in sight   He'd sent for Carmela to meet him at the banks of the Brazos tonight   She was waiting and he kept the promise he'd made such a long time ago   As he dropped the guns that she hated in the mighty Brazos below   Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn   Cross the Brazos at Waco I'll walk straight in old San Antone      Then the night came alight with gun fire he knew that at last he'd been found   As the ranger's band shoot brightly and bandito laid on the ground   Carmela knew he was dying that all of her dreams were in vain   As she kissed his lips for the last time she heard him whisper again   Cross the Brazos at Waco ride on and I make it by dawn   Cross the Brazos at Waco I'm safe when I reach San Antone      I'm safe when I reach San Antone.Beri hamba uang!!!!!!!!!!!!.What are we saying?.show      They're robbing the cradle of civilization   They're robbing the cradle of civilization   They're robbing the cradle of civilization      Suffer not The paralysis of your neighbor   Suffer not But extend your hand"
"On @DATE1 my friend @CAPS1 and I climbed on the bus headed for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together till @NUM1 am. We had been riding all diffrent rides all day and we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front said “wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours”, but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started a @NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnixous screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said “@CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6” all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did..'Cause this confusion always killing me   They all say that you're doing me bad   You're the best thing I've ever had   Somebody tell me, somebody tell me   Who to believe.Now I'm a man without a dream,   I've got a heart that has no hope,   All my senses are numb,   Losing you, I've become,   A man (I'm just a man) without a dream..Y que la vida nos vaya mejor   Que el a?.Oh I wish I'd never smoked so much   I wish I'd never felt the Devil's touch   All that passes through my eyes so fast..Old Woman on a train..Oh, who am I kidding?.youngbloodz lil jon (OKAAAAY!).Break another little bit of my heart, now darling, yeah, c'mon now..By the rivers of babylon, there we sat down   Ye-eah we wept, when we remembered zion..Some people say this town don't look   Good in snow   You don't care, I know      Ventura Highway in the sunshine   Where the days are longer   The nights are stronger   Than moonshine   You're gonna go I know      'Cause the free wind is blowin' through   Your hair   And the days surround your daylight   There   Seasons crying no despair   Alligator lizards in the air      Wishin' on a falling star   Watchin' for the early train   Sorry boy, but I've been hit by   Purple rain   Aw, come on Joe, you can always   Change your name   Thanks a lot son, just the same      Ventura Highway   In the sunshine   Where the days are longer   The nights are stronger   Than moonshine   You're gonna go I know      'Cause the free wind is blowin' through   Your hair   And the days surround you daylight   There   Seasons crying no despair   Alligator lizards in the air.Lord, cause I've a hunger for dreams I'll never see, yeah, babe..Caressing the marble and stone,   Love that was special for one,   The waste in the fever I heat,   How I wish you were here with me now."
"Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular.                My first one is when people don’t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don’t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesn’t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn’t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I’m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?

"“@CAPS1!” @CAPS2 whined, her voice escalating into a wail. “You can’t do this to me. I’m ten!” “@CAPS2, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I can’t leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work honey!” “@CAPS4 can’t you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year!” @CAPS2’s mother sighed. “I know you liked @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just wasn’t fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 “@CAPS7 if!”. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2’s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county’s only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. “@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment” @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother’s red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, “@CAPS12, why don’t you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting “little” @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2 we need to talk.” @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,” honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4.

"Patient people are the people that tolerate life. If you’re not patient you won’t get through to welI.I learned this when I was little. There was this thing I wanted and I was going to drive me, but just before I got out the door, the phone rang. My @CAPS2 picked up, “@CAPS1 oh hi @PERSON1 no not busy @CAPS6 did not! no!” and it went on for so long and every minute I kept getting less and less patient, I finally burst out. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “hold on @PERSON1 I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and walked away. That’@CAPS4 why patient is important.And if I can make that sacrifice, honey you can do it too..[I'm up the creek]   There more than one fish in the sea..[Now you know what to do when the day is through.].You will always know   That I'm looking for it with you      [Chorus:]   Is it in the sky?.Saturdays girls work in tescos and woolworths,   Wear cheap perfume cause its all they can afford,   Go to discos they drink baby cham talk to jan, in bingo   Accents..I know you're in there   Open up, open up!.Invasion..No good times, no bad times,   There's no times at all,   Just The New York Times,   Sitting on the windowsill   Near the flowers..Okay, Ring?.Don't raise your voice to me   And don't be unkind   I'm just a foolish man   Who doesn't know his mind   There is a reason   I don't love you like I should   And it's you   Yes, it's you   Oh it's you      Try understanding   I'm a simple man at heart   The way you carry on   I think we'll drift apart   I can't afford to live   The way you want us to   So, it's you   Yes, it's you   Oh, it's you      Why can't I love you   Why can't I love you   Cause I'm not the kind of man you are looking for      If everything is wrong   We'll go our separate way   You'll have to find a man   Who does just what you say   To break up is a shame   It spoils the chance we had   But it's you   Yes, it's you   Oh, it's you      Why can't I love you   Why can't I love you   Cause I'm not the kind of man you are looking for      If everything is wrong   We'll go our separate way   You'll have to find a man   Who does just what you say   To break up is a shame   It spoils the chance we had   But it's you   Yes, it's you   Oh, it's you.It's a shame you have a mind of your own now..Yeah well, he's underneath the window   Now she's singing ""hey-la, my boyfriend's back""   ""you shouldn't come around here   Singing up at people like that   Ah anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?"""
