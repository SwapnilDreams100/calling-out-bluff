"When I look into the mirror   Just can't believe, what do I see   There's no wakin' from this nightmare   And you're lost in your reality      So you tell me all your secrets   And you tell me that you're innocent   There's something in your eyes I can see   And my face keeps looking back at me      You Confess   You can't help yourself   This living lie that you can't go on   You're possessed   You can't fool yourself   You're the crime and you can't go on      Another day, another sorrow   No today and no tomorrow   Try and wash away the shame   And you smile in your picture frame      You had a charmed life, but you think from grace   And you're long gone without a trace   You're all alone and wonder why   And you laugh when you want to cry      You Confess   You can't help yourself   This living lie that you can't go on   You're possessed   You can't fool yourself   You're the crime and you can't go on      You Confess   You can't help yourself   This living lie that you can't go on   You're possessed   You can't fool yourself   You're the crime and it can't go on   It can't go on      God never spoke to me about your sin   So livin' in our lies will test the faith   So cut your straight lines on the mirror   And dip your hands in holy water   Try and wash away the shame   'cause all you've got is your father's name   (repeat choruses).No I never will no, no   And when this world is caught on fire   I wanna be caught in your will   I never will give up no, no,   No I never will, No, no, no, no, no      I'll always keep singin', ya, ya..There's gotta be somebody for me out there..And I cannot fail..And the sooner the better..Rachel: I'm limited,   Just look at me..A!.Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time   I just keep thinking and your memory is forever on my mind   You know I'll always love you and I can't forget the days when you were mine   Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time   The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy   Oh what a heartache but I forgive the things you said to me   Cause I believe forgiving is the only way that I'll find peace of mind   And forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time      The years have passed so quickly as once again fate steals a young man's dreams   Of all the golden years and growing old together you and me   You asked me to forgive you you said there was another on your mind   Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time   Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time.And who will aim the arrow   That men will follow through your grace   When I am lord of memory   And all your armour has turned to lace,   And all your armour has turned to lace?.[Chorus]   You can do ya thang shawty its okay   To floss but its still one rule player don't get caught..Gonna have a good time tonight..Yeah   Goin' to have some fun..I going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.” @CAPS1 get on another ride then”. We already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride."

"Did you ever really care?.A gift of love was given to   The world so long ago   Laying in a manger   He was wrapped in swadlin' clothes   And every year we celebrate   And thank the Lord above   And give to one another   Our little gifts of love..I-I-I'm ready for ya..!.Little pitchers have big ears,   Don't stop to count the years,   Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios..And now, the end is here   And so I face the final curtain   My friend, I'll say it clear   I'll state my case, of which I'm certain   I've lived a life that's full   I traveled each and ev'ry highway   And more, much more than this, I did it my way      Regrets, I've had a few   But then again, too few to mention   I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption   I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway   And more, much more than this, I did it my way      Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew   When I bit off more than I could chew   But through it all, when there was doubt   I ate it up and spit it out   I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way      I've loved, I've laughed and cried   I've had my fill, my share of losing   And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing   To think I did all that   And may I say, not in a shy way,   ""Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way""      For what is a man, what has he got?.(Violent J)   ""Detroit's in this bitch!!!!!"".I spit in his face... and I kicked him in the eye..You say this, you say that   Smart but in a way you're sad   Leave me alone right now   I used to be in love with this   Now I'm trying to get rid of all this human interest      Don't you dare to point your finger at me   Look at yourself   I'm not the one you want me to be   Look at yourself      Some say no, some say yes   Less or more or more or less   Leave me alone right now      I used to be adored each day   Now it's time for me to pay   The dreadful price of success      Don't you dare to point your finger at me   Look at yourself   I'm not the one you want me to be   Look at yourself      Some say no, some say yes      Don't you dare to point your finger at me   Look at yourself   I'm not the one you want me to be   Look at yourself      Don't you dare to point your finger at me   Look at yourself   I'm not the one you want me to be   Look at yourself.This is just to show my appreciation   For all of your love   For all of these years      [Chorus]   Your doin' the most (yeah, yeah)   I wanna learn (oh yeah, yeah)   To understand (oh baby, baby yeah)   And I like it babe (and I like babe)   Listen      You there for me   Everytime   You make sure that I'm   Alright      Down for me   With so much love   No matter what   I can't believe you deal with me      Even when I put you down   How can you keep giving?.Mean old Frisco   And that low down Santa Fe..And glover was a dancer,   Imitating eddie cochran by the jukebox..The time that I was patient was not long ago. It was a day of boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy some candy, I wanted a lorry pop. The man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy. It was @NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like that. It was at the cernical, I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the life gaurd instructer for not letting him on the ride. He was arguing for an half an hour. S was patient waiting for him to stop. I did not complane or argue about the man who was wasting our time."

It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the @LOCATION1 vs. the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the @LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again."
"Help us lose our minds   These slippery people   Help us understand      What's the matter with him?.All your life that's how it's been,   Looking out for number one,   Taking more than you leave,   Moving on when your done..Now that the past has ended   My life's an open door   I know that we could have been mended   Oh but I can't take the hurt anymore   Can't take the hurt anymore   Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore   The rainbow's over   But I've seen it leave before   A love that's been left in the corner   Ooh 'cause I can't take the hurt anymore   Can't take the hurt anymore   Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore   Lady of my lady's   Can't we find the right   And leave behind the sorrow   Lady of my lady's   Can't we find the light   Bright enough to guide us   Can't take the hurt anymore   Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore   This love grows older   But I've felt it all before   Yesterday's over my shoulder   Ooh 'cause I can't take the hurt anymore   Can't take the hurt anymore   Ah ah can't take the hurt anymore   My love I found has lost it's crown   But I just can't leave it die   I fool myself and no one else   'cause I would if I could and I try   Can't take the hurt anymore etc.....All the friends have died away, by a new law they abide   And all Gods' children, there they go, judgement on their side   Do you know a better way, to make it all good inside?.I love the way you undress now, baby begin   Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess   I love your blue-eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines through   How do you do!.No ?.Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?.Youll always be my sweet addiction   In this life my saving grace   Youre all that really matters   You know it's true   Aint no me without you..There's no way that you can win,   You must obey his every whim   Or else he's going to do you in..Red is a mother!.'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."".Said one day you'd be mine,   Your life you couldn't save it!!!.Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn’t know why she didn’t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but it didn’t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn’t hear her. @PERSON1 isn’t fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesn’t like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don’t know if they’ll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I’ve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad."

So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted. After those people were done he never call me up so he got on his phone and went outside.

Well, we went camping when I was one but I don’t remenber a lot. I was super excited! So, I’m sorry if I could’nt help but wonder @CAPS1 the ? are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasn’t really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said “daddy when are we gonna be there?” I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, I didn’t I took what I had learnt earier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every one in a while everyone is a little impatient."

We waited & waited for about an hour while my parent were discussing if we should or shouldn’t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad’s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn’t resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn’t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bring the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. He was surprised and over joyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. we all fell love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!"

But my sister was always calm and patient. Then the day they arrived we then got nervous except @PERSON1. The reason why she is patient is because she trys to keep off her mind by sleeping or reading. But back to report cards we opened them and then everyone was happy even @CAPS1 because we got good grades. Then after that my brothers and me learned from my sister and now we all have patience."

As I bent backwards again I slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then I pushed my shoulders forward and I did it! I finally did it by myself! Later that night I showed my mom I could do it. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom face could never be replaced @CAPS4 was so proud of me. Then I @CAPS4 ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said “thank you for being so patient.” @CAPS4 said “@CAPS5 for you baby.”"

Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at kings' island @NUM1 hours just to go on illegible. Socio. We waited about another @NUM2 minutes maybe @NUM3 minutes and yes! It started working again. So many people had left us was nicor because me line shortned some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting debating on wheiner or not. We wanted to stay or leave we ended up staying and waiting for which seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the space snottle. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally. The out was over! Using my patience and waiting inline forever really payed off in the end. It was a great ride."

A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shoping. My dad was at work and my mom took me and my older sisters shoping it was boring but it was kind of full because some of clothes in the store had boys on one side and girls on the other. One store only had girl       clothes which I hated. But I didn't say anything after that since I was so patient my my asked me where to you want to go? I said to best buy I got a game it was colloge football oq. When you have patient's it can pay off in the end and always have patiens where ever you go or are always have patients."

Something when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didn’t you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn’t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn’t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn’t have patience. But if they did that wouldn’t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not."

Because of @DATE2 physical coller coaster, I have missed three days @DATE1 and one day @DATE2 of school so far because I was gone visiting her. Now I'm back and trying to catch up with all my classes. So far I've achieved that goal with @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me and willing to hold off grading me until and the time catch up in their class I think I'll make it."

I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news. My friend went a few days before and said it was a good @ORGANIZATION1. When it was getting close to the end of the day the speaker in my classroom went “@CAPS1” then the lady and I had ?????????? for an early ?? mission I had been waiting for the moment! After I got picked up we went and picked my cousins up from school too! Then we went to there house got ready and we were off to a day we had all been waiting for…."

I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient."
"We only danced for a minute or two,   He stuck to me the whole night through..Blow up your tv, throw away your paper, go to the country, build you a home..Strangers in the dark..Well, deep in the

in the sky      And every moment extends endlessly   It feels as though time isn't moving   And every second, one breath not to breathe   I watch as he moves to the beat      Well, I'm on the floor   I watch from my seat   I watch as he sways with the trees   And slowly he moves, but so elegantly   I'm more on the edge of my seat      On the tightrope   Everything's bare   All that there is is

Sometimes I lose my patience when something take too long. In @ORGANIZATION1 seriously  there was an event called @CAPS1. It was raising and many people wanted to see if @CAPS2 would close down. The rain inocaculously did stop but I had to wait until @TIME1. It was only six for! So in other words my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was a unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally they let us in at @TIME2, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, I’m glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait."

A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words “practice makes perfect” she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me."

I timidly asked @PERSON1, ""would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?"" ""@CAPS16""I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day."

Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?’’ “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .” “Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn’t so patient , it might’ve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day."

Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours untill the plane came. Then we got off that plane we went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed to! So we had to wait a few hours again untill the plane came. Then we had to sit through another plane ride untill we finally got to @LOCATION1. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there."

This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the @NUM1 children. When we finaly took off we were in turbulence the whole @NUM2 hour flight. Which ment we couldn’t get up, @CAPS1 food, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the @CAPS4! Flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops till we got to the @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a : memory I will never forget. The stuborn little smerk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her “chicken little.”"

We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn’t put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didn’t know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasn’t patient in this game we wouldn’t have won and I wouldn’t have gotten the trophy to take home with me."

We sat for @NUM1 minutes band then we hear the doctor calling my name. We go inside the doctors room and I sit down he does all this things. Later he yells us that we have to meet one more doctor. We sat down again and we waited. Then we hear my name again so we go. The worst thing was that I saw a medicine on the table and I was really scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that she took the medicine and was going through it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she through the medicine in my eyes it burned a little. I didn`t want her to do the other. I wanted to just stand up and run outside, but I couldn`t she did the other eye and told me to now keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back she me that was it, and we were done there. I thought to myself, that wasn`t so bad."

It hard for me to get them to calm down. But , I noticed that if I was pacient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be pacient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being pacient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being  a lot when  I was babysitting them the next time too."

My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2’t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “ro” and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom."

I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually I’m not very patient usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that I’m really impatient. For some reason when I’m really excited I’m fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient."

a time I was patient for a whole day! It was @CAPS1 eve and it was about @NUM1, meaning I just woke up, I ate breakfast brush my teeth after I got out of the shower. By now I would have probably ask my mom @NUM2 times if I could open one present, but on this day I hadn’@CAPS6 ask he once yet. I was up string playing my play station when my mom called up @CAPS2!!!! I open my door and as usual my cat was right at my door I shut my door hop over my cat get to the stairs then yell food. He sewried down the stairs and right to the canter. As I start walking down the stairs I hear a @CAPS3!! So I start running down the stairs as fast as I could knowing my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They meet @CAPS7 at the counter and ask @CAPS7. “@CAPS4 many times have you ask to open a present?” “@CAPS5” I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2 about @NUM5 minutes later I was done watch @CAPS6.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day."

I am about to tell you and that time. Two years ago.  I worked at my @CAPS1’s home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ???  he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1 that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing. “I know but you deserve it.” I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off."

On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1’s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 said. “my name’s @CAPS4.” @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. “@CAPS2.” I said back. “I’m @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.” “@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1.” @CAPS4 replied. “@CAPS11 let me show you around.” “@CAPS12!” I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boy’s name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just woulden’t let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, “@CAPS13’s @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.” “@CAPS15?” @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 coulden’t do same thing. “@CAPS16 you just don’t have any patience!” I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 coulden’t understand. “@CAPS17 be that way  @CAPS1!” @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. “@CAPS4 wait!” I cried but I hat to run after her. “@CAPS20, please you don’t get @CAPS13. You can’t keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before?” I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. “@CAPS21.” @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again."

The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said “@CAPS6’re leaking trannie fluid.” @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). “@CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip” I said to @CAPS2, “@CAPS6 don’t know that for sure” he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didn’t help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 weren’t sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said “were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car."

My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m deticated, I’ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, I’ve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!"

Now Heads of state who ride and wrangle      Who look at your face from more than one angle      Can cut you from their bloated budgets      Like sharpening knives through Chicken McNuggets....I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my for-wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home exept for my grandma, my dad don’t want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not their. At that point I was inpatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. So I called my dad and he said it was @CAPS1 if my uncle @PERSON1 said it was fine with him. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore."

It must be that I did…, I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide still nothing. I just turned the t.v on. A @PERSON1 just ended. “@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1,” the @CAPS8 commercial said. “@CAPS10 see this,” I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought. It was a no color @PERSON1 that was about a police official and his son. After watching four hours of the @PERSON1, I heard the goings door open. I heard @CAPS1 come in and say, “@CAPS12 got it!” @CAPS13 then I said, “@CAPS14,” and then fell asleep. “@CAPS15 wake him up.” @CAPS1 whispered."

Eventually we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait now longer. This helped in my future."

In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient."
"To the warsaw pact and the nato pact..So you heard I got laid   And betrayed by a maid in a one night stand   And I'm caught in the middle of something I don't really understand..Wind in the willows, wild and warm,   Just like the woman lying here in my arms..Here I go again it's another messy morning   Walk around the clothes that are covering the floor and   Take my kiss and coffee to go   Then put on my mascara while I'm driving down the road   I thought that I could do it all   Turns out I was crazy   Man I need an iPhone and a cleaning lady   We haven't had a date night in what seems like forever   It might take a miracle to get myself together      Oh I wish that there were more than   24 hours in a day   I haven't found it yet but there's gotta be a way   And I keep praying that   I can get everything done   And still have time for love   And a load of laundry      I'd sure like to relax laying in a bubble bath   But then I'd have to clean the tub and really who's got time for that   There goes my day dream I'm just wishful thinking   Oh shoot I'm running late, I gotta make it to a meeting      I've been waiting for this moment all day, just you and me   The lights are low, next thing I know   We're both drifting off to sleep.It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque   It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque   All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it   Can you feel me, can you feel it?.Oh I don't understand at all, he-he-hey      She's got nothing on but the radio   She's a passion play   And like the break of day   She takes my breath away      She's got nothing on but the radio   It's a passion play   And like the break of day   She takes my breath away      She takes my breath away   She takes my breath away.(must take for my senior prom)   Won't you be my prom queen?.I'd give you my heart,   I'd give you my heart if I could!.I'm only flesh and blood (ooh)..The melody haunts my reverie..Ah, it's a happy time inside my mind   When a melody does find a rhyme   Says to me I'm comin' home to stay   Oh, Lord, home to stay   I'm comin' home to stay   Home to stay      Ah, lord, it's just the same old story   Something about love for glory   A nickel and a dime a dozen   Fame   Ah, it's such a shame   Ah, the way they use your name   Ah, you know it's such a shame   When it's only mine to sing a song   Hoping that you'd cross along my way   Before I have to move along   Ah, now move along   Ah, but I'll be back again   Ooh back again      Ah, it's a happy time inside my mind   When a melody does find a rhyme   Says to me I'm comin' home to stay   Oh, Lord, home to stay   I'm comin' home to stay   Home to stay      Sleep late now mama   Let the mornin' sun warm your bed   While I'm away   While I'm away.And if you don't start living well,   You're all gonna wind up scarecrow people too..Patience is the key to life some say. I don’t really know if it is or not. Patience is when your quite, you can wait for things. It is when you can do hardstuff with out feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties. Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. Patience does not lie, it makes things better when they are difficulty. It makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things."

It was @NUM1 my mom was on time prepare ???. I was in a hurry to get going. Today was the day that the x-box @NUM2 came out and I wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running arch I could get it. As an hour past we arrived at the grcery state. I darted inside and grabbed a cart. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any ginks of being impatient. After what see made like hours we were done and the next stop was the library. I couldn’t do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quickly. It was already dark when we finally went to best buy to buy the x-box @NUM2. We went and got it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day."

It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didn’t see anything but we weren’t going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn’t hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie."

I sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, @CAPS6 the food was at! I reached out and - wait @CAPS6's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza enticed my sense and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, ""@CAPS6 is the food?"" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. I bailed to the other line. I gripped tongs with disappointment and put chips and cheese on my plate. At least l had some food! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience ."" l got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometime you @MONTH1 get rewarded!"

I was waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be hard sometimes but everybody can have patients."

And yes @CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I had said “on what.” @CAPS1 he said “@CAPS2 math homework its just too long and I can’t do it.” @CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. @CAPS1 I helped him. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper."

They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn’t panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners."

  Echoes in my head   Make every whisper turn into a scream      I dreamed I could fly   Out in the blue   Over this town   Following you   Over the trees   Subways and cars   I'd try to find out   Who you really are      In the middle of the night   Cool sweatin' in my bed   Got the windows open wide   Thinkin' about all the things you said      I wish I could fly   Out in the blue   Over this town   Following you   I'd fly over rooftops   The great boulevards   To try to find out   Who you really are   Who you really are      I wish I could fly now   Wish I could fly now   Wish I could fly now      I wish I could fly   Around and around   Over this town   The dirt on the ground   I'd follow your course   Of doors left ajar   To try to find out   Who you really are      To try to find out   Who you really are.Treated us like plasticine town   They build us up and knocked us down..What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient."

My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors. It was a long day. At first we went in and it it took a hour just for her to get in. and she finally did get in and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I would see people come in and then go out. I see about @NUM1 people do that. I sat and read magazines why I was waiting she finally came out. When she was the day was pretty much over with then. And that was a very patient day."

Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life."

This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I’m empty on the inside, i goess. There’s gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He’s always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He’s useless now, but I’m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it’s not just @CAPS2 who I’m waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, sight. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he’d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn’t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. He’s gone hasn’t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. I’m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I’m still waiting for a hello."

I think everyone should show loyalty in your ??? because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the “aliens”. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesn’t cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, “I tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself."

If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn’t care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn’t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know.

We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1! It was a night more coming true. We got hungry. We really didn’t compliments. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were companing a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didn’t take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fum to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day. The end."

My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2.  My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned."

Patience is about waiting for some thing. Like we can say your new shoes will becoming in two weeks instead of paceing around worrying all the time. you just walk around like honnel. For example hunting you sit and wait for a deer to come. If your inpatient you would go look for some. Sometimes a lot of people can got inpatient about something and become mean. Being patient is understanding why it is taking a long time for something. You have to to herdteif it dont come the come the @DATE1 it supposed to.

It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs."

He was turning @NUM1 years old. So we played games played on the trampolenc. They we came inside to relax and watch some television. We played with there dog after a while. Then a lot of people came over. We went outside for a third time played. We had to come inside and @CAPS4 up for dinner. We all ate turkey, baked potatoes, cheese potatoes, squeen, beans. That was pretty good. Then they wanted us ??? project. It was a jon with a candle in it. We had to cover it in tisue paper and it uses lots of glue. I had to wait patiently I was the last one to domine. So I walled waited ??? then finally I got to do my project but I was ?? Only one there sitting at the table doing my project. It actually turned out pretty good after all. Being patient con get you very far in life. You have to be patient in a job, restraunt, and lots more. So remember just be patient and you'll be okay. Being patien will guide you through your hole life."

It was @DATE1. My sister was turning @NUM1 years old. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “You have wait”. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s @CAPS3 slow,” @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, “@CAPS4 up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. That’s my story I told in my own way."

A..Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it,  patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and @CAPS1 my patience was before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!”@CAPS1 your patience!”my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me."

The only reason why I didn’t complain was because most of the stuff and the bascket was mine. That was a time I was very patient"

The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me I’m not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient."

my dad before, @DATE1. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and did not get one. Some other guys shot one they all run way. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in we were all there from @TIME1 until @NUM1. I was patient the whole time."

Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was no where in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing. I stopped I felt my back pocket and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Any way, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stuned to see who it was. It was my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. Off to @CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: @CAPS6 I 'm at @CAPS4. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait. In conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient."

When I was sitting down at my desk quietly she (The teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page.

"Then they came on me   They dragged me from the bar   Still wet from sweat and beer      I bruise so prettily by men   Blinded by their fear, these men   Broke my back and made me lame      Then she said to me   ""I'd give you everything to make it like before   To make you love me like you used to""      Make you love me more   She said to me   ""Your life is large but your mind is lame""      I can't believe my eyes   When I see the truth   And all the things I've done      And every place, I'm queer   I never stay, I run   I know now why I live in shame      Lame   It's hard to sleep at night   I hardly ever sleep at night.AH-HAH-HAH-HAH-HAH..Heaven knows how long it will take..Gracious Good Shepherd   Will you answer when I call your name?.Ride with the idol,   Like a creature on display,   Tied to the bottom of a cage..O mothers let's go down,   Let's go down, don't you want to go down,   Come on mothers let's go down,   Down in the river to pray..Though you try you can't conceal it   Love has only brought us storms   I can see your eyes revealin'   Your a stranger in my arms   Say goodbye to our romancing   We have lost the flame that warms   Though I hold you while we're dancing   Your a stranger in my arms   Every story has an ending   This is where our story ends   Please don't hurt me by pretending   For lovers never can be friends   Through the years your love will haunt me   And I'll dream about your charms   Still I know you'll never want me   Your a stranger in my arms   Every story has an ending   This is where our story ends   Please don't hurt me by pretending   For lovers never can be friends   Through the years your love will haunt me   And I'll dream about your charms   Still I know you'll never want me   Your a stranger in my arms.Please tell me, 'cause I know how..The first one that came was a man of Kent,   And all that a man ought to be..Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind   Following them fairgrounds a-calling..Searching for the way,   Through all the doubt and sorrow..On sticks and sand, lost my money, lost my hands   Blood on my brain, too much salt in my veins      And I thought pain was clean   And I thought hearts were strong   But bones aren't sticks anymore   And a day is far too long      So many days never needing any grace   Live for kicks and danger, there'd be beauty anyway      And I thought pain was clean   And I thought hearts were strong   But bones aren't sticks anymore   And a day is far too long x3.Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have."

got beating   On a Sunday afternoon   I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses   And stars were still illumed   I have three hearts that I keep apart   Trying to relate   To normal feelings and the nighttime reeling   And some absinthe drunk so late      Small town girl   My small town girl      The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk   Onto the size of dessert plates   But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy   And some opium to set me straight   I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl   While my looks still hold me straight      Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion   Of reality mixed with drink   I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl   Looking at the Brandenburg Gate      Small town giving it a whirl   Brandenburg Gate   Small town girl   Small town girl.Ain't that tough enough?.I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you come rain or come shine   High as a mountain and deep as a river come rain or come shine   I guess when you met me it was just one of those things   But don't ever bet me cause I'm gonna be true if you let me      You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me come rain or come shine   Happy together unhappy together and won't it be fine?.Maybe we forced the deal, delivered some kind of blow   Maybe we broke the seal, cracks began to show   Maybe we crossed the line, got everything off the ground   Maybe we lit the fuse, a habit hard to lose      All I can remember, all I can recall is you   Telling me there's been an accident   Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do   Every day I miss your innocence      Maybe we ran the lights, somehow we caused the scene   Maybe we learned to fight, as part of a routine   Maybe we jumped the wall, suddenly tipped the scale   Maybe we tried too hard, so afraid to fail      All I can remember, all I can recall is you   Telling me there's been an accident   Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do   Every day I miss your innocence      Something's lost, for what it's worth   You and me, this is our church   There is still some love 'round here      All I can remember, all I can recall is you   Telling me there's been an accident   Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do   Every day I miss your innocence.And you know when I was in school,   We used to sing it something like this, listen here:      Oh beautiful, for spacious skies,   For amber waves of grain,   For purple mountain majesties,   Above the fruited plain,      But now wait a minute, I'm talking about   America, sweet America   You know, God done shed his grace on thee,   He crowned thy good, yes he did, in brotherhood,   From sea to shining sea..Iron winter, got me cold   Convicted like a criminal   Sharp and nimble, the wind unfold   Got me to my feet again   Past the mountain I hear a cry   Coming from the pinnacle   Oh, In the distance a city shines   Oh, what a welcoming      [Bridge]   Been to the black rock   Found my salvation   Rendered me patient   But wearing me thin   So I'm      [Chorus]   On the way back home   Seen the big show, thousand times   Got to get back what is mine   The only way I know   Feet been walking, thousand miles   Got to get back what is mine      Bless the evening, it's showed the way   Back to where it all began   Oh, undercover I made my case   I'm quietly a gentleman   Man, To be a fool is such a waste   He'll eat until he's sick of it   Why not stop when you find your place   And be happy that you made it in      [Bridge]      [Chorus]      What is mine   Fallen time      [Chorus]      On the way back home   I'm on my way   You know I'm on my way back   The only way I know      Getting what is mine   Gonna get it back, give it back now   I've come so far tonight.""Without my Uncle Rat's consent""   ""I wouldn't marry the pres-I-dent."".(Food processors are great!).Motor      Still can't believe it, can't stand to leave it   But I know the rules   We were doomed babe, too much too soon babe   Acting like fools      Tried to fly and climbed too high   We saw it all, we had to fall   But I swear it's true, was all for you   I swear it's true, was all for you      Making love all the time,   Never let the day go by, or a night   Sweet music in the dark   You always found the spark to light my light      [Chorus:]. Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short my family is really patient wether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient."

It was @NUM1 @CAPS1, my parents were just finishing the packing for @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. We're going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose  ternament in @LOCATION2. It is a terrifying thirteen hour. We started loding to a van with are soutcases. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the @DATE1. That even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in are van. I ran back in the house and unpluged my @ORGANIZATION1 gamecabe.  I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on are trip. As we're just leaving I start pluging in all the wire and game controlles. The we start off. For the first coaple hours we just liscened to the radio. Then came the affect of my brother and sister owe never get going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @NUM2 hours this out and we were in @LOCATION1. We started seing mountains. They were wonderful. @NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the???movie for the last hour. The hour went be like a flash. Finally done that is a time I was sort of patient."
"till the day you were born ?.Why should I be hypnotized,   By the promise of a long life?.I can hear it..""One of the things that's happened, is that this movement has acquired an air of inevitability"".Bought me a cat and the cat pleased me,   I fed my cat under yonder tree..There's room at the top they are telling you still,   But first you must learn how to smile as you kill,   If you want to be like the fool on the hill,   A working class hero is something to be..When it looked as though my life was wrong,   You took my love and gave it somewhere to belong..You're a perfect lover   Ain't it always that way   You feel a little twisted   You feel a little pain   You're a little hateful   Don't worry, you'll feel that way again   Cry, don't   Cry don't cry for me   You say that you're not beautiful   But you are in my eyes   You say my love's too heavy   Well that comes as no surprise   It's already over   There's nothing to say   It's already over   But you need to love to show you your way.I think I better   Better let it go   I better let him go..Someone else asked, ""What do you care?"".Deserted again..Is there something holding you back?.Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably could’ve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field."

In third grade one day it was one of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world."

My family and I go to @CAPS1 point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds)  A couple years later the new ride The @CAPS4 opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didn’t. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we go to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing.I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines."

I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. There were flys everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” @CAPS1 quickly replied. “@CAPS5! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “well I don’t wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might!” by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didn’t get front cart the wait wasn’t even that bad."

When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient."

Twilight eclips, me and my mom were heading to the movie theature and I wouldent stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, “@CAPS1’s one mom” “sweet,” she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours strate. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so exided, the movie was about to start. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got @CAPS1. This was the story when I used patience."

Weather its waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend I am never patient. The only time I can be patient is when im waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if im waiting for school to start. Then also the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I will run around the house for hours until a friend calls. ?? when they do call I rush right to the phone and answer it right away. I will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back til bed time so I will never have to clean my room."

The line almost took @NUM1 hours. My cousin was just simpily silent cvery unasul) and just waiting .I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet running around etc. I was about to die of boredom .My legs hurt, I was hungry, I was too hot. I just couldn’t stanistrn. She was just standing there not talking. When we started to move I got a little happier but still impatient. After @NUM1 hours we finally got into the ride. After the ride I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said for every word one of us said we have a minute of homework when we come back to @LOCATION1. I was stuck doing homework the next whole week. Thats how I learned my lesson to be patient"

It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don’t. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn’t stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over “stiff upper lip.” I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn’t work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. “I want to go home” I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said “@CAPS2” all grouchy. I had sniffled and said “I want to come home, I miss you.” and sniffled more. “Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.” @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1’s car. “@CAPS4 didn’t you want to stay?” @PERSON5 asked calmly. “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks."

I have, especially this one main time in my life. That on main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is @CAPS1 mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull.??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check up. The @CAPS6 said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side I t means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. I ran to her and she screamed ”@CAPS3 is going to have babies”then I scremed with her. We went and got dixixe and then we took her to the bark play and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now @CAPS1 was get bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be six months atleast until she has the puppies it`s aready been five and half, mom said, that she has milk now’ I told my sister, @DATE1 . “I wouldn`t doubt it,’ said @DATE1 then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today” then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now. “then we said our goodbyes and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said “oh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babies” we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright.” I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier. Tinker, bella, harmony and melony. I love my dogs!"

I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny.

Being patient isn’t that hard if you try. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for ???. Five minutes past and they still weren’t don so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still weren’t done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done ??? was only two minutes. ??? well I guess I give it another try and if I still don’t get I’ll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasn’t making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said that we didn’t have to do that one and I laughed and told her ??? figure it out all yesterday. That is an example of bein patient"

Tell her you love her, its added protection   That's why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot..It's sucha shame, but I'm leaving,   can't take the way you mis treated me..Your tender lips that brought me pleasure..Let me tell you a story   About a woman and a man   Maybe you will find familiar   Maybe you won't understand   The man's name I don't remember   He was always Joe to me   But I can't forget the woman   She was always Christie Lee   He was working in a night club   That's where he played the saxophone   He used to fake to stock arrangements   He left the customers alone   But one night before the last song   About a quarter after three   He saw her standing at the coat check   And made his move on Christie Lee   Christie Lee, Christie Lee   Christie Lee, Christie Lee   She was a nice piece of music   She had a rhythm all her own   He blew a solo like a blind man   She really dug his saxophone   She wanted more than just an encore   And he could play in every key   He left the stage and packed his alto   And took it home with Christie Lee   Oh I heard the man knew ""the Bird"" like the Bible   You know the man could blow an educated axe   He couldn't see that Christie Lee was a woman   Who didn't need another lover   All she wanted was the sax   It took a while for him to notice   It took a while for him to see   He was never in control here   It was always Christie Lee   Christie Lee, Christie Lee   Christie Lee, Christie Lee   Oh the man took a calculated gamble   Yes the man had the power to perform   But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle   She didn't need him as a man   All she wanted was the horn   They say that Joe became a wino   They say he always drinks alone   They say he stumbles like a blind man   They say he sold his saxophone   Even the band must face the music   That's what the moral is to me   The only time you hit the high note   Is when you play for Christie Lee   Christie Lee, Christie Lee   Christie Lee, Christie Lee.I'm a boogie man      We're the boogie girls, oh yes we are   We're the boogie girls, oh yes we are   Boooo... !.Soon they escaped, spreading their seed,   Preparing for an

When the doctor ask my brothers questions when he says then I am already coming up with my answer and then its my turn, but before my turn @NUM4 sce the doctor I was ireally patient. Then it took the doctor @NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with. Then he has to talk to my mom that comes my time with lls. When we do to the doctor or dentist we and really patient but it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do."

One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while."

The time I was patient is when it wast the first week of football. We went town to subway before the game and got a cub. I was the first one in line but then I was folowed by other people olny one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I was up next I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana, pepper, cucumbers and great frech spinach.   It rearned something in that line being patient realy pays off and by the time in at back. It had over been @NUM1 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first games we played starta we tied it though but that was still a great day!"

Many people @CAPS4’t have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but here’s a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like there’s no tomorrow. To bad I couldn’t play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience..” @CAPS1” ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face. “ @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser , lions are winning and steelers are loosing “he added. “@CAPS4’t get to happy , there’s still plenty of time left.” I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I ‘d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. It was the being of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, “who is the loser now, huh?” wow all it took was patient, and hope” I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate what’s happening around you, you’ll end up getting rewarded!."

A patient person experience difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do @CAPS11 I did it before. “@CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS2, this isn’t even moving.” @CAPS3 brother and @CAPS3 broter obvousilly wasn’t being patient. Hello, @CAPS13 me mame, I mean man, can you walk any shower? “@CAPS4, I can if you want me to.” A nice man said in a kind friendly voice to @CAPS5.” @CAPS6, are you that dumb, I wasn’t for real. I m cut you just because of your stupuidity .” @CAPS5 said, trying to act all tough. @CAPS5 was only a year older than me (@NUM1) and he thinks he’s all big and can di anything he wants. “@CAPS8, little man you can’t cut me, I was waiting in line forever.: that nice man said to @CAPS5. “ well , too bad .” while @CAPS3 brother was  making eniesnes, was waiting patiently in line even though the line wasn’t really moving, inside I wanted to out every one @CAPS11 not like some people I have patients and can wait. After @CAPS3 brother cut that man and didn’t get punished he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very very mad at @CAPS5 @CAPS11 not one did anything besides say,” @CAPS8 don’t cut me.” @CAPS11 that didn’t’ really help. Intill @CAPS5 cutted the @CAPS15 person. That person was a young pretty body with beautiful blue eyes and has such pretty blond hair, her name was @PERSON1  “@CAPS13 me police man, this  young , little boy just cutter we and every one else. “@PERSON1 said. While I was waiting there patiently, @CAPS5 got kicked out of the whole park’ @CAPS15 in line please, “  “ @CAPS1 that’s me …. Won.Were “was the best roller coaster I had ever been on. Being patient is hard @CAPS11 can be rewarding. I also learned to be patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerant. Now, @CAPS16 know you get the best when your patient. And the worst when your not."

It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, it’ll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have."

I must be most patient when I am playing or watching sports. Every weaken my brother play in a play football league and it can bewaring. I have to bit almost two hours for the games to be over and my parents make me wat in the game. My favorite speed is football and since I am a first base man and an eat fields; I have to wait of the ball to ??? so that  I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the meap because it is a long so and I must wait until people are we done. As you can see, I am very patient are have to be in many situations."

What I was waiting for was the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk with themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and @CAPS7 hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tooth time. “@CAPS4, I got it!” @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say joining them into my pockets. “@CAPS6, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said, “@CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the specker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”"

He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else."

One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that!"

For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it."

She told @CAPS1 she couldn’t get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasn’t doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her I’m fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn’t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids but her self and @NUM2 of them is hises.  But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. But beening @CAPS1 I didn’t want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. My mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all here stuff she looked pretty everything went while but know on on we still cry in think about her. Then that was a time I didn’t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she’s in a better place with some of her love ones. But into this day I can’t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 forgotten."

In this narrative essay I will write about @NUM1 different times when I was out had to be patient. Such on the waiting to get out of school on a holiday. And when I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so I could get my game. Another thing I had to wait for was to get my final so as in the ??? all these times I had to be understanding. One day  I was very anxious to get out of school on a firday. And to make it I bad the clack was drare and I had  a planned schedule of my think day. When one thought passed by there like another set  in thinking for way I can stare at the abat and it would change. I was about to get a call home but the @CAPS1.A saved me. And I had to be understanding about that moment. Another time I had to be understanding about was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See what had happened was I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it.

Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient."

Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they’re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it just be patient and it will pay off."

I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks so I did just that. I waited and bought some other stuff with the left over money and the game finaly came in the mail. that’s a time I use patients to wait for something."

I,can proudly say that i can. It all started when my uncle steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed alot of help so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem was there where @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But,it didnt take long  for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. So all of the @NUM1 kids start fighting. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was atleast a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn’@CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @NUM1 hours I’d had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about @NUM7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patients I had. After that I dont think that I want to go on a roadtrip again."

But every time he’d only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds so he tried and tried finally he just stopped well it @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes, @LOCATION1 was really mad now so they went to bed. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning he found @LOCATION1 cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient."
"Cause when I'm in the club every thing goes down..I don't know when but we'll get together then, Dad   You know we'll have a good time then      Now I've retired, my son's moved away   I called him up just the other day   I said, ""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""   He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time   My new job's a hassle and the kids got the flu   But it's nice talkin' to you Dad, it's sure nice talkin' to you""      As I hung up the phone it occurred to me   He'd grown up just like me   My boy was just like me      And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon   Little boy blue and the man on the moon   When you comin' home, Son?.I'll take all the smog in California   'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,   'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines..We're on our way (X15)      You tell me not to worry   Because you're the boss..One day, without no warning,   Things start jumping up from the ground..This lonely spiral I've been in   Hey monkey, when can we begin?.Broad old woman   And how many times   Have you done to same to theirs?.Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,   Don't stop, it'll soon be here,   It'll be, better than before,   Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone..Hold on tight, call my name,   Don't get caught in the midnight rain..I saw you yesterday with another girl   When you looked my way   I just pretended I didn't see you   What else can I do      Chorus   You were all I've wanted   'Cause you just don't seem to care   You took me for granted   And I don't think it is fair   But my heart keeps telling me   That you'd be there for me   And I'll just wait and understand      When you looked my way   I just pretended I didn't see you   What else can I do      Repeat Chorus      But my heart keeps telling me   That you'd be there for me   So I'll just wait and understand      Ooh....But some where's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while,   You'll find the broken-hearted when you're travelling jungle-style..Birds fly over the rainbow,   Why then, oh, why can't I?. One day I was being really patient. I was baby sitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or you’ll go to your room. So he stoped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home now that a whole different story. So thats the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters."

Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone."

My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. So we sat around till all of they were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said “why did you get of line?” “I am scaryed.” “ I want to go on it though.” “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 said” @CAPS1 we go on the ride?” “@CAPS2 we @CAPS1” my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when @CAPS4 said “I @CAPS1 wait.” “@CAPS3 lets get it over with.” @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now."

But this didn’t stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said “no!” @CAPS2 time went on @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing @NUM1 mph fasiball at a cetcher. On day’s that he’s unaccurate he doesn’t gave he keeps trying and doesn’t wine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to some seltons patience."

So at that point we only had a hour or so left I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination key wrap. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tryed my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didnt are and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @NUM4°@CAPS3 degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didnt even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But how I know I have the patients to go home!"

spring-time   Still green   Lying there by the road      He told her, ""love demanded space""   So they roamed from place to place   Although she realized she'd sinned   She grew caution to the wind   As she followed him around   While he slowly dragged her down      So overpowering was her love   The it had made a captive of   The young girl's heart and soul and mind   In other words: love drove her blind      Oh, young girl   Oh, young girl of sixteen   Child of spring-time   Still green   Laying there by the road      Too much emotion for a girl   She let her heart become her world   What

the clue.As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically   the bud unfolds, the bloom is dead,   all space is living history..This emptiness I feel without you   Close to my heart   (Close to my heart)      Don't ever, ever say goodbye   (Say goodbye)   Unless you wanna see, wanna see me cry      (Baby don't you know?).If you say so long, if this is goodbye..You're goin' away, away from me   But here in my heart is a memory   The way we met, the way we kissed   The way we fell in love   Oh, the little secrets that we shared   When I was sad, the way you cared   To let me know you'd understand   The way you'd hold my hand   Cherished memories, the things that a fellow can't forget   Cherished memories, you're leaving but I love you yet   And now you say that we must part   And even though it breaks my heart   There's one thing you can't take from me   That's my cherished memories.Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4’d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didn’t belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “@CAPS3!” I shouted, “I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop” I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  “@NUM1 minets till midnight” @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me “That’s impossible” I told her. “You can make it.” @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. “@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen” how is it going to end” @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. “@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad” @CAPS10 asked. “I guess not” I answerd sheepishly. “Being patient payed off’ @CAPS10 lectured. I didn’t reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that I’m a little better at being patient things will be a lot better."

He learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it. @PERSON1 learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes."

After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game."

I was sure I was going to be on the A team. I tossed the ball up and let @CAPS3 drop back down. The toss was no good. I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. “@CAPS1 last serve” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didn’t make @CAPS3 over. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervos by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3. I felt a ruch of relief and excitment when I saw the sight of the word “congradulations.” @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldn’t of had @CAPS3 any other way."

Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you."

Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say “Patience is vertile.” @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”"

Once when me my dad were supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait until my dad and he said he was getting of work at @NUM1 oclock and that’s the time the races starts. It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasn’t going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in there cars. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. @CAPS1 they did figure eight boat race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said “no w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.” @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2."

The reason is that we don’t have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and got changed into our bathing suits, we went down to the pool, found a spot, and put our towels there. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds. And finally a buzzing noise ringed in y ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it get my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasn’t worth it, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time ill try to be less agervated and more happy, maybe."

Every day you'll see the dust (Too much, Magic Bus)   As I drive my baby in my Magic Bus (Too much, Magic Bus).The wedding took place and people came from many miles around   There was plenty merriment, cider and wine abound   But out of all that I recall I remembered the girl I met   'Cause she had given me something that my hear could not forget..Somewhere a red-eyes waitress glances at another movie magazine   Down on the corner there's a grocery boy stuffin' boxes fulla hungry dreams   Someone's cleanin' up the offices, one window burnin' in the dark   Somebody's cryin' is there any way in hell   To light a comet from a single spark   Workin' so hard I can't remember much about the freedom I been workin' for   Felt like a prisoner 'til I looked in your eyes   And saw a million wide open doors   Ya tell me put a little money away, well every dog will have his day in time   Well I been slavin' like a dog and I got nothin' to show ya   But a collar and a fist fulla nickels and dimes   Chorus:   I want a piece, a piece of the action, give me a shot at the real thing   I want a piece of the action, a piece of the action   Gonna turn on the master, gonna cut these strings   Gonna turn on the master, gonna cut these strings   Been livin' just like my old man did and neither once of us could get it right   Punchin' in when the day begins and punchin' out the local boys at night   There's someone leanin' on a peelin' porch   And someone leavin' on a silver plane   And I finally know the man I'd rather be   Girl I won't be back to getcha 'til they know my name   [Chorus:]   They hand you a paycheck every week and steal a piece of your soul every day   An' I don't need no gold watch in fifty years, baby let's be golden today   (chorus repeats 2x...)   (Solo)   [Chorus:]   Somewhere a red-eyes waitress glances at another movie magazine   Down on the corner there's a grocery boy stuffin' boxes fulla hungry dreams.Why would you waste your time?. When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen."
"Not love you anymore!.I'm a hot apple pie with a cherry on top!.Oh I get drunk most every night, seems like all we do is fight   The more I drink, the less I feel blue   Sometimes I feel like an awful fool   Spendin' my life on an old bar stool   And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you   [Incomprehensible]   If this date were to be our last, I'd never sit down this glass   It'd take all the booze in the world to forget you   You've left my heart a vacant lot, I'll fill it with another shot   And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you   [Incomprehensible]   Looks like I had my fill, guess I better pay my bill   When I started out I only meant to have a few   Someone just said that you left town, I better get a double round   And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you   Yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you.Was there a witness to this?.Fate took a freeway to my room   Said to much while he stayed   And left too soon..I can give a hundred million reasons   To build a barricade   I blame it on the changing of the seasons   The thoughts that I've conveyed      Does it make it all right?.Because there's hands out of nowhere, saving me again..All: It's a Fine life!.Is there room for me?.I'm not surprised   Not everything lasts   I've broken my heart so many times,   I stopped keepin' track..I see you across the room   Search for some happiness ain't anytime soon   Turmoil has turned you inside   Sift through your pages of miracles you wish to find      [Chorus]   When you're too numb to cry   And you're just left wondering why   When you're too numb to cry   And you're just left wondering why      To change in the blink of an eye   If you could you surely would wave yourself goodbye   I try and I try and I try   Get a hold on your suffering   Peace in which you don't wish to buy.And we've got to show them the light, we've got to pour out our lives..Patience is having control over yourself write you wait. In order to be patient you have  to wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. @CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. Fon example if you go to the doctor office for a yearly check up , you have to sit in the waiting room for at reast one hour before they call your name. But patience is sometimes. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an @CAPS1 is ,is something someone mode up. Not that people have patience"

It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. When you we’re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it’s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, but now, I’m done. (yes!)"

So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun."

My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you."
"Let nothing abuse you or come from behind..With trembling hand I took the letter from him,   I broke the seal and this is what it said:   ""Come home, my boy, your dear old father wants you!.If I have to make up my mind,   Maybe now is the time to decide..Introduction   God bless America, the land that I love      Verse 1   God bless America, land that I love   Stand beside her (ooh), and guide her (ooh)   Through the night with the light from above      Verse 2   God bless America the land that I love   From the mountains   To the prairies   To the oceans, oceans white with foam      Bridge   God bless America (4x)      Vamp   My home (3x)   My home sweet      Ending   God bless my home, sweet, home.I said Jake, Jake, Jake,   Don't you wait, wait..Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy   Yeah, it's whatever..One night they were made man and wife,   And now they cry, ""This is the life,""   Since they came from their aba, daba honeymoon..I don't wanna hear that you adore me,   And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games,   Don't you know that game repeats game?.Crowds are swarming   You've had for-warning..Please me, baby..She has future plans,   And dreams at night,   They tell her life's too hard,   She says that's all right, yeah,      She's a wild one,   With an angel's face,   She's a woman child in a state of grace,   When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,   He said you can be anything you want to be,      She's a wild one,   With an angel's face,   She's a woman child in a state of grace,   When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,   He said you can be anything you want to be,   She's a wild one,   Runnin' free..When I'm shook up, shook up, shook up      How can I make it through the day?.I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when she couldn’t find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat was on the on phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isn’t that patient and I learned I’m not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn’t. That’s  the time of when I know  someone was patient."

This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results we’re very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “@CAPS3’s wrong!” @CAPS11 her mom. “@CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish.” “@CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience” said mom. “Patience? @CAPS3’s that?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don’t complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient.” “@CAPS6 I’m waiting” said @CAPS7 “@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot.” The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. “@CAPS9” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS3’s this?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “@CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12’s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.” “@CAPS13 you” said @LOCATION1. She couldn’t belive @CAPS12! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait."

Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient."

The first place we went was he state of liberty. We got in live for the ferry that takes you to the island where the statue of liberty is. We got in the line for the ferry that toves you to the island where the statue of liberty is. The line was hug antic. I thought, ""@CAPS4 great"" because it was neatly @DATE1 outside and we were going to the waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the live goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty. It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. @CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of way self for not complaining. Apparently @CAPS1 mom was to because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me a side and thanked we for being so patient"

She doesn’t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave."

I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. While still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for you flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have. To be patient in waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don’t like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do."

She came in and said “@CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later?” I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. Then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. There was a few cars in the lot but it didn’t seem like much. When we got into the store that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said “@CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?” “I’ll try”. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said “@CAPS4 you for your patients”. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said “Do you see what happens if you be patient?” I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient."

We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car ready to break down and our clothes we out grow. When my grandma finally got her check we went strait out and got a brand new car. and clothes.

Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that’s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else."

So I had to wait until next @NUM1 @DATE1 so I waited, and waited, and finally @NUM1 @DATE1 has pass and she forgets so she had to get groceries. So @DATE1 I ask her one more time and she said. Yes but she had to pay my dad back on helping her and after that she said after school I??? bringing my film out to buy. So how now told you how??? I have waited to do that also had to get a new diginal camera because it has been droped to many time."

He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long.   We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matt’s girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on.

We staid there until @TIME1 then we left. When we were there my dad shot a doe @TIME1 @NUM1 in the merking. He short another doe @TIME1 about @NUM2 in the @TIME2, so we left with two big does in the back of my dads truck. That was a time that I was very patient."

When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got their we got checked in and there was alot of people there so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting I was sitting on the ground being really board. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn’t know. Finally the doctor called my name. So I went in then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor, then when she was done I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was working with a different patient but then he finally came then I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient."
"When we're apart the words in my heart   Reveal how I feel about you      Some kiss may cloud my memory   And other arms may hold a thrill   But don't do nothing till you hear it from me   And you never will.you've got me all drawn out   I'd give it all away to get you off my mind   Yeah, yeah      But some things you can never let go   Some things you should never let 'em show   Some things you can never let go      Let go, let go   Don't keep draggin' it out   Let go, let go   You're no good for me now   How much more can I take?.Come on now, set him free   Try open up his eyes   And make him realize his misery      He do not care   Sittin' over there   Get up, stand up now   Wake up the animal inside of you      I think it should be inside.Can't drink the water, can't breathe the air   They said it was exciting, never said it was fair   You're just another singer in a pilgrim's suit   Chased by the lines till you learn to shoot   In the badlands, the badlands, the badlands   If you've got those black diamonds   They'll remember your name down there..On my way home   I remember   Only good days..Slackers   Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?.Drove through the valley on my way to the sea   I was lookin' for the answer to what's botherin' me   Sat there all day and I stared at the blue   There's no denyin' I was thinkin' of you   Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'   And I love you baby without good reason   I walked to the corner, watch the world go by   Hands in my pockets and my head in the sky   What does it matter now that everything is fine   When I can't eat, sleep, or even walk a straight line   Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'   And I love you baby without good reason   Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'   And I love you baby without good reason   But it's hard, you make it hard, ah   When I first met you I was barely alive   Had no direction baby you had the drive   We headed out on the wild open road   Till we broke down from the weight of the load   Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'   And I love you baby without good reason   Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'   And I love you baby without good reason   I drove through the valley on my way to the sea   And I was lookin' for the answer to what's botherin' me   Sat there all day and I stared at the blue, wow   There's no denyin' I was thinkin' of you, but   Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'   And I love you baby without good reason   Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'   And I love you baby without good reason.Is everybody happy now?.Let us go!.(Give me just a little more time)      My god how scarred we are,   To feel so little in somebody's arms..Multitudes behold His glory   And give praises for what He has done..Why waste the wine in this glass,   The love in this room,   To making up, girl   We're so good at that..Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4’s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!"

When im patient is mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be patient to wait for deer. They don't always come sometimes it could just be a fawn. Other  times it can be does. put when you see a buck ???is everything you first have to wait for it to come in close enough for a shot. When it does you have to wait to bring up your gun. Then you have to wait for a shot. If you get it you be patient and wait for it to die. If you cdnt find it right away dont give up. That is when I was patient."
"Da da da, da da da,   Da da da, da da da,   Happiness returned to me,   Through a grave emergency.Why he's here I will never know   He makes you know you feel   Like somewhere to go      Mr. Sun won't you shine?.There's been some things that I've wanted to say a long time..Fuck 'em, buck 'em, if they really wanna trip,   Niggas keep your hands on your motherfuckin' shit..I guess my heart has settled back to Earth..I never thought that it would be,   Not in my wildest dream,   I've realized that your not the one for me,   So why can't you see, that,   I gave my all to you,   But you proved my love untrue,   So tell me boy what am I supposed to do,   About you, about you you you oh o      Chorus:   I gave you what you wanted,   I gave you what you need, I walked the fire for ya,   But now I'm gonna leave,   I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time),   And now my eyes are open,   Won't be a fool no more,   I built my world around ya,   And now I'm out the door,   I'm leaving for the last time..The sun that's falling from the southwestern sky   Tells me that I must depart,   So, by sundown today, I'll be on my way,   But I'll be leaving my heart..A!.Whatever happened to the value of our love   I've seen you change   I've seen it coming slowly, these changes   You're not the same      It's not too late to start over   It's not too late to turn around   What are the things important to you?.I'm easy to hate..Oh my god, I don't think I can last here   (I don't think I can)   My god, can we go any faster?.Whatever the rights, I want the wrongs..What is patient? Being patient means to wait for something that @MONTH1 take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is your waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say ""stop your being patient. Before you be rude and keep begging for what you want think of other people, understand why it might have longer then you want and be patient."

On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of a seven.

She layed @NUM1 butiful, blue, perfect eggs. Days went by, and the eggs did not hatch. The momma bird got upset. She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""@CAPS1 be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the @NUM2 oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, ""@CAPS2 can't I fly yet"" and momma said,"" @CAPS1 be patient."""

But, there was a very long line. @CAPS1, my mom kept on telling he to be patient. @CAPS1, I just stand there quietly. Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said “what kind do you want?” @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all. Then my said “stop listing to that music” @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched tv and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That is the time I was being patient."

Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life."

No matter how hard its going to be I can do it with patience. My friends and have been patiencent and still are. I meant could you stay patiencent if you were goning to meet your favorite celebirty that you love? Well it’s not that easy first off it takes a lot of patience to do chores and take care of your animals, plus count how much money you have. And when people borrow your money that really sets you back. But like said no matter what we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus tat to meet him and we are going to be patiencent the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons and you get to see and learn how to become patiencent. Overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life."
"He is destined to be a King   He rules over everything   On the land called planet Dune..Cause I am the captain of this ship,   Wanting eyes and kissing lips..Can you love mine?.Don't want to think about it anymore   Lying curled and naked on the floor   And I don't want to hear those words you say   What were they anyway?.Got damn that's high (Yeah!).But I'm a tell you what true love is..He says, solid, he says   Takes me in his arms   And says, solid, he says   Meaning all my charms   He says, solid, he says   Is that the language of love?.From a distance, the world looks blue and green,   And the snow capped mountains so white..Remember when you were more easily led   Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed   Trembling as your dreams came true   You looked right into those blue eyes and knew      It was love, and now you can't pretend   You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend   It's bad enough, she knows how you feel   But she's not prepared to share you with the memory      So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her   If she begs you to?.Then my neighbor, he blew his nose   Just as papa yelled outside,   ""Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes."".I'm standing in the backyard   Listening to the party Inside   Tonight I'm drinkin' in the forgiveness   This life provides   The scars we carry remain but the pain slips away it seems   Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams      I'm watchin' you through the window   With your girlfriends from back home   You're showin' off your dress   There's laughter and a toast   From your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen   Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams      In the darkness my fingers slip across your skin   I feel your sweet reply   The room fades away and suddenly I'm way up high   Just holdin' you to me   As through the window the moonlight streams   Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams      Now the ritual begins   'Neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers   The dance floor is alive with beauty   Mystery and danger   We dance out 'neath the stars' ancient light into the darkening trees   Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams.Now today as long years fly   Do they wander side by side,   And do their dreams into the future wind,   Do they still recall the day when she turned to him to say,   Darling take my hand and let's pretend..It was the @DATE1 and I, @PERSON1, had applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I had applied in @DATE2 and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION2. From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day.  Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience."

After a few week had past I forgot all about the game then on @CAPS1 day my sister and I got down stairs so fast then when we were oozning gifts I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go grab it and I opened it and it was it x-men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and tow other games that I wanted offer that I go up to my room grab my @CAPS5 and headphones pop in x-me @CAPS3 and played it all day long"

I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stoped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting on the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so exited!you see I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn’t just go running off I had to be very patient. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening."

Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient."
"I'll keep on givin' to those who are lost..it's here I sit and rust amid this ruin and rancor like tire irons   toothy grills and car parts before me...the acid rain floods my   floorboard, burns my pores, and rots my upholstry.. once I was   worshipped, polished magnificently, now I lay in decay by the dirty   angry bay....But let that daylight start to fade and your best laid plans might get mis- layed..Let me behind the wheel..Now the iron bars are broken, Christ from death to life is born   Glorious life and life immortal on this holy Easter morn   Christ has triumphed and we conquer by his mighty enterprise   We with him to life eternal by his resurrection rise..Won't you get the fuck out of my face, now!.Wed hide from the light on the village green when I was seventeen..Its like a letter in the mail to a brother in jail,   It's a matter of time until you can do a little bit better time..Don't leave me tonight (So baby don't say you're goin')   Don't leave me tonight (Oh baby stay around)   Don't leave me tonight (I can't take it, can't take it,   Can't take it, can't   Take it without you, so baby please hang on)..If I do, will I know when I'm there?.Oh, say can you see   By the dawns early light   What so proudly we hailed   At the twilights last gleaming?.There's a world I know.. In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time."

It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (@NUM1 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @NUM4 ocklock @CAPS2 time and,in @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am.  I was very tired of being patient, I’m not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!"

I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. There is my mom who “claims” to be patient, shes is not! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tence up and get frustrated when @CAPS1 inpatient! When @CAPS1 waiting to call someone I am tempted to call them a hundred times. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isn’t up yet."

We where fishing on a cold night and no fish where bighting,. I was just @CAPS1 ther being patient caling sun flower  seeds. My dad was getting mad and I was still @CAPS1 listning  to the backeasard  celtcs  games.  We where only catching little fish that night nuthing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didn’t have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample."

I had a teacher that no one could remember to gave us our report card in band class. So after a few weeks I made a bet with him that if he didn’t bring us our report card the next day he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally. It was the end of the year. And he still didn’t have them. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said?? yes are only suppose to give me and  he told me “ the second one is ? being to patient.”"

Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do @CAPS1 practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It take patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn’t when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting."

It was the night before she had her. We were all asleep. When my mom started to scream we all went into her room my dad asked her what was going on she said “she coming” my dad raced to the car put it in to gear and left without us and my mom who was about to have a baby. Then when my dad relized he forgot us. So when he got home to pick us up. It was already morning they took us to a room. They prepared my mom up. Me amd my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the deveiring room we were so paitient it took over an hour to get her out. when they were stiching my mom up the brought my little sister to get all cleand up. When we could see her through the window. I had to see her get her first bath, shots And when the put those patches on her I had thought she was an @CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. And we all liked that name. I was so @CAPS3 that day."

I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!"

Being patient is all about being tolerant and under standing. Sometimes when @CAPS6 in a bad mood I have @CAPS9 be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset it was buring @DATE1 vacation and my little sister @ORGANIZATION1 wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream tank that rade by every twenty minuts frome the ice-cream shop which was about seven @CAPS9 ten block away. I was bund @CAPS3 in my blanket when she jumped @CAPS3 on @CAPS9 my bed. “@CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I want @CAPS9 go get ice-cream. @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!!!” @CAPS5 I said in a mean voice. @ORGANIZATION1 you little hob –goblen get off my bed OR @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 YOU @CAPS9 A @CAPS10!!! I was younger and in a terrible mood that crying is sound so sill and stuped. Tears came @CAPS9 her eyes and I didn’t realize at that moment that she was little (fore years old) and didn’t quite understand that I didn’t fell good. I apologized and explained that I was sick. Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said “I made mama make you some tea”. That was hart warming @CAPS9 me. After I drank it @ORGANIZATION1 asked if I felt better. I said a little then @ORGANIZATION1 got @CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and new that she didn’t fully understand yet. So I got @CAPS3 and took her @CAPS9 the ice-cream shop @CAPS9 get some ice-cream. @ORGANIZATION1 was happe ans that made me happe. I fell extremely proud that I was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 eve whe she got on me nerves. I know I was n’t patient with @ORGANIZATION1 at the “beginning” but at the end I was."

Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me."

Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient."

One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. “Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?” I asked wondering if it would easy to get it. “@CAPS2 buddy we just ran out.” @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess I’ll have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didn’t grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort."

Patients  to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @NUM1 then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid.  But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time."

All the guy said “I’m so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before you”. “@CAPS2 are you kidding me” she yelled as she stopped way and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I’m inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said “Do deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be inpatient again."

have a version of Elvis Presly doing this song, but I think it's a traditional, also known as 'I Wish I Was An Apple', or as 'Sydney'..I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher’s or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I’d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one."

All I did watch trees after my battery end on my @ORGANIZATION1. Dad was considtrated on the road, mom finally and license plates to see travelers. Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you could hear, mom, @CAPS1 and my stomagh growling, we didn’t stop. We had to get to @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotels front desk shut down. At @NUM3 we were crushing through the state of @LOCATION1 to then arive at @TIME1 at the hotel we were so excited that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes in the bed."

It means that; “you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn’t complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn’t want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn’t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn’t think about it, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always turns out good!"

I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins won’t change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldn’t think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue.”"

A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming.

I told her to be patient and it would fill like time is going faster .She said, she is going to try, but if it didn’t work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. Me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat."

She was sad @CAPS2 weeks had passed and @CAPS4 was the beginning of a new school year .She had been patient all @DATE1 @CAPS3 to see him again. Finally the first day of school came she skipped up to him and he @CAPS3 called a way .Couple of confused weeks late she said to him are you jumping  me or ???He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient waiting for an answer @CAPS4 never came. Finally she decided to jump him but, she never did. So @CAPS5 gabby and me did .@CAPS4 far her on the outside she was mad but on the inside she was probably screaming today she has “moved” on and now is dating a boy named @PERSON2."

After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music at  his ipod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the  front of the line.

She needed ??? help from everybody @PERSON1 would sent the down in the ??? to help the girl ???. She struggled a lot and never would she rent she would shut the book as though it on the flame ???. But that was patient and everytime she ??? every time she stoped reading. I would make her keep going. Every time she out it on the floor, I would ???. Eventually the girl saw that it didn’t accomplish anything ??? this, so, she just read. Now I was to be patient with how slow she was reading. I.P she didn’t know a word I would help her sound it out. The girl kept getting better and better at reading until she don’t need me anymore. But iwas proud of myself for being patient for once."

In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the meap. I just sat there finished, just read and drawed. It was absolutely boring, lame, and seconds felt like hours. It was terrible, but I didn’t complain I just sat there and did nothing. And that was probably worst time when I want to talk but couldn’t."

The people that work in cedses was trying because there a lot of people and everybody was lewing. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about the pizza. The little kids that are hungry were showing patience than the angry adults. They were all whining and everybody said they don`t want to hear you so you had to shut up. After he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut. He didn`t bother to speak. Everybody were back to normal and everybody had smile on their faces and even the little kids everybody got their pizza really fast.  Always be patient."

It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!"

My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well I get out of school at @TIME1 my dad gets at @TIME2So,if  I wanted his  help , I would have to wait myself  but I didn’t understand it. Even with homework that needed help on back in my backpack until my dad got home I wished the homework that didn’t need help on. After my homework   that which I did all my @CAPS1, then it was time to eat, as I ate my dinner. By that time I was done waiting my dad me, more and really to help we as my dinner.

We had been riding all diffrent rides all day and we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front said “wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours”, but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started a @NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnixous screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said “@CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6” all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did."
"(Chorus)   So kiss me and smile for me..On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you   And hold you close to me, all night long..Yeah, yeah      I will refresh you   Come to me, do   Come to me, often   I'll come to you   I'll come to you      Always in my heart   Always a song   This is the good part   You'll always know where you belong      Come to me, darling   Ooh, baby   Come to me, darling      Come to me, happy   Come to me, bad   Come to me, looking   What you ain't had      I will sustain you   Come to me, do   Come to me, often   I come to you   I come to you      You are the kind one   I've waited so long   How does one find one?.Ah ah ah ahhh (Oh god damn)(Ooh)   I'm gonna fackin cum (Oh shit)(oh yeah)   Fack fack faack, (Fuck I am) (Ooh)   I am, I'm going to cum   I'm cumming (oh yeah)      OK I'm done, I already came twice,   You ain't gonna make me cam,   I'm all outta gas, not so fast!.I see you in the morning rain,   oh step inside and lay beside me..We already played that   We're going to lighten it up a bit   We're going to lighten it up a bit   This really isn't a stupid song   This is a special song   This is an important song   This is a dance song   This is...(Born to love you).King of a kingdom..Funeral held for the depression of man   Holds the key to his own death   Entering a tomb of a corpse yet conceived   Tighten the tourniquet around your neck      Sifting away the debris of hated life   Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine   Seeking life beyond your perishment   Repeating words echoing through your mind      Chanting lines of blind witchery   To save yourself from extinction   Wanting to die is your reason to live   New life born from the oppressed      Taste your blood as it trickles through the air   Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall   Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near   Fatality, reality, you await the final call      My sinful glare at nothing holds thoughts of death behind it   Skeletons in my mind commence tearing at my sanity   Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth   Come and die with me forever   Share insanity      Do you want to die!.I love you sweeeeatshirt   red hooded   sweeeeatshirt   dip dip dip   sweeeeatshirt   shama lama ding dong   sweeeeatshirt..I met a lot of women on the road   I'm piping this world wide and everyone knows her   But something about her makes wanna slow it   Spin the one more time I like that she has a mind on her   I gotta get her won't stop till I got her   She focus she goes to school she works from ten to two, hey   Cause shawtys , cause shawtys, 'cause shawtys fly   I could use someone like you by my side   As long as you're a rider, a rider,   I can know you down   Baby are you down   So you should get to know me, little momma   So tell me what it's gonna be, little momma   Hop in the ride, in the passenger side   I'll show you just how to roll   Come kick it with me tonight   Don't be afraid, everything is all right   Na na na na      She wanna come with me, little momma, wanna   But do we have enough and do you wanna ride tonight?.What about all those men?.Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular.                My first one is when people don’t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don’t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesn’t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn’t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I’m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs."

I’m ten!” “@CAPS2, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I can’t leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work honey!” “@CAPS4 can’t you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year!” @CAPS2’s mother sighed. “I know you liked @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just wasn’t fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 “@CAPS7 if!”. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2’s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county’s only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. “@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment” @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother’s red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, “@CAPS12, why don’t you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting “little” @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2 we need to talk.” @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,” honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe he’d still be game for you."

If you’re not patient you won’t get through to welI.I learned this when I was little. There was this thing I wanted and I was going to drive me, but just before I got out the door, the phone rang. My @CAPS2 picked up, “@CAPS1 oh hi @PERSON1 no not busy @CAPS6 did not! no!” and it went on for so long and every minute I kept getting less and less patient, I finally burst out. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “hold on @PERSON1 I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and walked away. That’@CAPS4 why patient is important"

symphony   The sweetest music I have ever known   A song of joy and pain   The mountain angels sing   A bittersweet refreign of my Smokey Mountain Home, heartsong   Farmer's daughter if you will   And I often wonder still   In memories where I rammbled as a child   Makes me cry and makes me laugh   My reflections on the past   And the family, friends, and faith that shaped my life   Ragged clothes and hand-me-downs   Just enough to go around   But the sweetest things in life are always free   Like the songs the birds would sing   And the sweet new grass of spring   And the sacred blossoms on the dogwood tree   Repeat Chorus   And I recall the thrill and joy   Of a Smokey Mountain boy   I remember my first kiss and my first love   And the songs I'd song and write   And the dreams I'd clutch so tight   And the loved ones that gave me that extra shove   And in that little house 'a prayer   Where I spent many hour   Prassin' God and liftin' up His name   And asking Him to lead and to keep watch over me   As I headed up that rocky road to fame   And now this, Smokey Mountain girl has been all around the world   But it makes no difference just how far I roam   I still cling to that part that is so dear to my heart   My faith in God and memories of home   Repeat Chorus.I'm back in the sea..Chorus:   I've got a brand new shiny helmet, and a pair of kinky boots..Ooh, oh, shake, shake, shake, shake,   Oh, oh, oh, oh, aching, oh, oh, aching, aching, aching, aching..The trees are spinning oxygen   They're the rockets we should fear   If we go and let them off then we will disappear   Then we will disappear, surely we will disappear      The road is hot and dusty   The desert needs a beer   But if we go and blow it up then we will disappear   Then we will disappear, surely we will disappear   If we go and blow it up then we will disappear   We will disappear surely   We will disappear   We will disappear   We will disappear   We will disappear   We will disappear   We will disappear.There's a spirit of a storm in my soul   Every time I think it's gone away   Dark clouds gather, that old wind begins to blow   The sun's going to shine someday I hope   There's a spirit of a storm in my soul, in my soul.. In the @DATE1 time my mom had planned of trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. We were on our way is airport and there was?? trying to work through traffic but we could not. So my mom starting yelling and l told her just calm down we will make it.

So finally we made it to @LOCATION1."
