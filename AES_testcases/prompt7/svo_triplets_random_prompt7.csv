"going to write I about a time when going went to the @ORGANgoingZATgoingON1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.” @CAPS1 get on another ride then”. We already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think they’re holding you up, but it’s the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don’t shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride."

"mwriting I about the tiwritinge m was patient at a @ORGANmZATmON1 gawritinge. It was my birthday and my dad took me, to go to watch the @LOCATION1 vs. the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple miles ahead and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day the @LOCATION1 ended up winning. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order. I will never forget that birthday again."
"Patience is when experience are waiting for something to happen and experience difficulties you but experience do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn’t know why she didn’t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but it didn’t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn’t hear her. @PERSON1 isn’t fragile at all, he loves his dad and so does she but she doesn’t like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer. In conclusion I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don’t know if they’ll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I’ve asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad."

"was camping trip my first It! Well, we went camping when I was one but I don’t remenber a lot. I was super excited! So, I’m sorry if I could’nt help but wonder @CAPS1 the ? are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasn’t really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said “daddy when are we gonna be there?” I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, I didn’t I took what I had learnt earier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every one in a while everyone is a little impatient."
 A tiwere waiting of when I was patient was when were waiting & my siblings to see me if they were going to alow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parent were discussing if we should or shouldn’t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad’s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn’t resist. So he then said yes. I then had to be patient. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn’t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bring the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. He was surprised and over joyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. we all fell love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!

"is something Patience that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient."
"is virtue a Patience I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something take too long. In @ORGANIZATION1 seriously  there was an event called @CAPS1. It was raising and many people wanted to see if @CAPS2 would close down. The rain inocaculously did stop but I had to wait until @TIME1. It was only six for! So in other words my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was a unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally they let us in at @TIME2, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, I’m glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait."

 A tisister that sosisterone has been patient with sister is when I was younger and my taught me sister now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words “practice makes perfect” she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And that is an example of one time someone was patient with me.

When my mom broke her hip ,she moved slower than my grandpa you are probally asking yourself  hour does this make her patient ,@CAPS1 @CAPS2  had to follow her every where she went if @CAPS2 wasn’t patient I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in @CAPS2 mean @CAPS2 took here almost fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom . Normally I’m  not a patient person at all ,but when this  happened I had to be patient .I’m  glad @DATE1 that I was  patient because now I am more patient then I was before .My mom is proud  of my behavior ,because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed @CAPS2 .Being patient is a good thing, you look at life  different .now I can imagine me being patient.i mean I’m not glad my mum get hurt but I’m glad of my consequence of the problem .After the big accident hapend I have learned  that everyone needs a little bit of patience like me that is one example about how I thought of  I small were here away ever  been patience ,without my mom."

 Have you ever had waiting hour line @NUM1 tot? this is what it was like for me and @CAPS1. We were at ceder point waiting to ride too thrill dragster. We had just got there the first thing we decided to do was ride the top thrill dragseter but the line was about a three hour wait we went anyway. We had just fineshed our first hour of waiting but it felt like three. I knew I had to be patient and relaxe but it just felt like forever. after anthor hour my stomach started to growl I checked my watch it was @NUM2 we had got here at @NUM3 I was starving and tiered but I stayed finaly an hour later it was our turn when I got off I knew it had been worth it to be patient. In conclusion I learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life.

"am never paitent I, but which am never am it is only once and a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I’m doing nothing and it is really quiet. I get really bad headaches. In school for example and I’m waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ?? ?everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. When I wait to long I feel lazy and tired because I’m not moving at all. I get buggy when I’m paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can’t be paitent very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is playing sports and doing things constantive."

"When was seven I was played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard seen @CAPS3 player on my team. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn’t put me in yard. I knew if I stayed calm and be patient me ??? would have let me play. So when it was the @DATE1 with a minute left in the game and we where down by @NUM2 my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in and it was @NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball and started making all my shots. But when it was @NUM1 seconds left and we where down by @NUM5 point I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. I made my first shot without a problem but my second shot I didn’t know what to do so I thought about what I did to play in the game patients, so as I got ready to shoot I got patient with the shot to think it out and when I shot it I made it so once the other team got the ball to inbound it we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasn’t patient in this game we wouldn’t have won and I wouldn’t have gotten the trophy to take home with me."
"Patient, that’s all go am when go fishing I. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you arent too because after the motor runs you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing."
"A time when was pacient I pacient when was pacient babysitting and the kids was pacient  babysitting were acting up. It hard for me to get them to calm down. But , I noticed that if I was pacient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be pacient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being pacient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being  a lot when  I was babysitting them the next time too."
"Just as finished eating I my hamburger finished noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. “@CAPS1’s that?” I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2’t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “ro” and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom."

 Once apoon a time was place a there called unpaciente land. But on grumpy lane lived a little girl namend @ORGANIZATION1. She was the most patient girl ever. One day @ORGANIZATION1 went to get her hair cut “at mtso fast saloon!” When @ORGANIZATION1 got there everyone was screaming at @CAPS1 the hair cutter and @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said hey if you want your hair to look good sit down and be quiet and everybody did. @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a beautiful haircut just like everybody else and then @ORGANIZATION1 because the mayor of unpaciente  land renamed it @CAPS2 land from that day forward every body was pacient.

About an hour later we finish our game and take a bike ride we got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2 about @NUM5 minutes later I was done watch @CAPS6.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day."
"showed patience I before. I am about to tell you and that time. Two years ago. I worked at my @CAPS1’s home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ??? he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1 that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing. “I know but you deserve it.” I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off."
"Middleton middle school, ’mone I of their students. My name is @CAPS1, I’m new here, but you @MONTH1 think that I’m a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 I’m not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1’s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. “@CAPS2.” @CAPS3 said. “my name’s @CAPS4.” @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. “@CAPS2.” I said back. “I’m @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.” “@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1.” @CAPS4 replied. “@CAPS11 let me show you around.” “@CAPS12!” I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boy’s name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just woulden’t let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, “@CAPS13’s @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.” “@CAPS15?” @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 coulden’t do same thing. “@CAPS16 you just don’t have any patience!” I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 coulden’t understand. “@CAPS17 be that way  @CAPS1!” @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. “@CAPS4 wait!” I cried but I hat to run after her. “@CAPS20, please you don’t get @CAPS13. You can’t keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before?” I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. “@CAPS21.” @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again."
"call was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who call @LOCATION1 I and @ORGANcallZATcallON1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1’s gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. @CAPS6 pulled over @CAPS2 got out took one bok, and said “@CAPS6’re leaking trannie fluid.” @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). “@CAPS7 is going to ruein our trip” I said to @CAPS2, “@CAPS6 don’t know that for sure” he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didn’t help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 weren’t sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch @CAPS2 said “were going to have to call triple A to come pick up our car. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. On the way out of the restorant tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car."
"could ride was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so could ride wheeler my for-I. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home exept for my grandma, my dad don’t want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not their. At that point I was inpatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. So I called my dad and he said it was @CAPS1 if my uncle @PERSON1 said it was fine with him. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore."

"“When do ve get the xbox!” asked @CAPS1 I. “@CAPS2 hours,” he replied. “@CAPS3!” “yes.” “@CAPS4.” “@CAPS4.” @CAPS2 hours…. I thought, this is gonna feel like a week. First, I got on the computer. After ten minutes I got off because nothing was ???. Next I looked at the t.v guide. Nothing. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I did…, I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide still nothing. I just turned the t.v on. A @PERSON1 just ended. “@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1,” the @CAPS8 commercial said. “@CAPS10 see this,” I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought. It was a no color @PERSON1 that was about a police official and his son. After watching four hours of the @PERSON1, I heard the goings door open. I heard @CAPS1 come in and say, “@CAPS12 got it!” @CAPS13 then I said, “@CAPS14,” and then fell asleep. “@CAPS15 wake him up.” @CAPS1 whispered."
"A time when took was patient was when took @CAPS1 test the I in @NUM1 grade. In my class there was only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders while the rest were @NUM4. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. To do this you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading. That was the time when I was patient."
"is key the Patience to life some say. I don’t really know if it is or not. Patience is when your quite, you can wait for things. It is when you can do hardstuff with out feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease you can do it without difficulties. Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. Patience does not lie, it makes things better when they are difficulty. It makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things."
"One day went and my brother hunting me at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didn’t see anything but we weren’t going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn’t hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie."

"goes minutes another @NUM1 There wasted! I knew I should of got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @CAPS1 for food? Three days ago, l though that l should stop at my locker before going to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, @CAPS6 the food was at! I reached out and - wait @CAPS6's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza enticed my sense and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, ""@CAPS6 is the food?"" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. I bailed to the other line. I gripped tongs with disappointment and put chips and cheese on my plate. At least l had some food! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience ."" l got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometime you @MONTH1 get rewarded!"
"A time were had was patient was when had to wait I in the waiting room before had got my broken foot. I was waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient my mom and I just sat on the chairs for a hour and a half. Finally the nurse said “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be hard sometimes but everybody can have patients."

"One day not @CAPS1 very long ago, my had @PERSON1, homework troubles brother. And yes @CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I had said “on what.” @CAPS1 he said “@CAPS2 math homework its just too long and I can’t do it.” @CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. @CAPS1 I helped him. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper."
 The time was patients I with my little brothers! I was baby sitting and they wouldn’t lison to me or my other sister and I just relaxed and got on the floor and played with them after that all went well.
 Do know anybody you who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life.

"was time a There when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1! It was a night more coming true. We got hungry. We really didn’t compliments. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were companing a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didn’t take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fum to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day. The end."
"Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 was early @DATE1, the beginning just to change leaves colors and flutter down above your head. My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2. My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned."

"One was friend the often best time I had went to a ride it friend so hot outside but the first ride we on friend called the @CAPS1. The line was super long, it was like going  through a maze because how the rope were tied up we stood in the line for about forty five minutes but it felt like two hours . But I didn’t really complain about except for my friend she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large  feet were tired, but when we finally got there we stared rolling to know how . When we sat down in the rollar coaster it was so much fun. I think it was worth waiting for."

"One time had to be I really patience. It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you going to get here, are you lost, and did you get me some co-co weats? I thouth that was really funny. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs."
"am going to talk I about what am going think patience is. I think patience is about waiting. For example “you were very patience in line for cotton candy”, said the clown. You know something like that I know this a short story, I’m sorry."

"am going to tell I a story in my own way. It was @DATE1. My sister was turning @NUM1 years old. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “You have wait”. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, @NUM2 cousins and I all had @NUM3 @CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s @CAPS3 slow,” @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, “@CAPS4 up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games. That’s my story I told in my own way."
 One time I was patient when I let a stranger to get of me food some cut infront. And when me and my brother both had to use the bath room I let him go first even though I was first in line.
"is thing a very hard Patience to capture. The way I think of it,  patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and @CAPS1 my patience was before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!”@CAPS1 your patience!”my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium: so bad! Finally we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . When it was finally my turn I just ran right in so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me."
"Every year have family reunion a we for two haveeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of @PERSON1 right next to famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me I’m not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient."
 One time had to be I very pationt. I had two wait five hours before my grandma to get to my house. Every hour I would go look outside to see if she was there. Eventually she did and I was very happy. Some examples too shels stay patient are… @NUM1. Focus on something else @NUM2. @NUM3 too someones house for a while. @NUM4. Or even tack a nap @CAPS1 are examples of staying patient.
"went was patient before; went hunting I with my dad before, @DATE1. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and did not get one. Some other guys shot one they all run way. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in we were all there from @TIME1 until @NUM1. I was patient the whole time."
 One time me and my dad were at a store.was line a There about @NUM1 people my dad and I were starting to get impatient so I told myself to calm down and wait. But I was still not calming down then the very first person left and then was starting to calm down and just wait for the next person to go.

"is in my words to be Patience able to wait along time for something and not angry and not rato bee your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely wan’t get things done. Most of my family and I don’t have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have."
"A is when I was patient cousin when it was winter is and my time and I really wanted to go outside. My kept saying “@CAPS1 you will be able to go out”. My cousin was very mad, she was having a fit. I was just sitting there on my couch telling her what my mom said. After an hour past I was able to go outside, but my cousin could not. She wasn’t being patient. That is a time when I was patient."

 Some peoples when take time a long people my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short my family is really patient wether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient.

"was breezey morning a light It. It was @NUM1 @CAPS1, my parents were just finishing the packing for @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. We're going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose  ternament in @LOCATION2. It is a terrifying thirteen hour. We started loding to a van with are soutcases. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the @DATE1. That even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in are van. I ran back in the house and unpluged my @ORGANIZATION1 gamecabe. I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on are trip. As we're just leaving I start pluging in all the wire and game controlles. The we start off. For the first coaple hours we just liscened to the radio. Then came the affect of my brother and sister owe never get going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @NUM2 hours this out and we were in @LOCATION1. We started seing mountains. They were wonderful. @NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the?? ?movie for the last hour. The hour went be like a flash. Finally done that is a time I was sort of patient."
"Back when had was in about third grade had to be I really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably could’ve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field."
 In third grade it day was one it of my happyest day of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn'@CAPS1 wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world.
"A A time when was patience I is when our family goes to @CAPS1 point. My family and I go to @CAPS1 point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds)  A couple years later the new ride The @CAPS4 opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didn’t. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we go to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing.I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines."
"is patient thing a very hard Being to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. There were flys everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” @CAPS1 quickly replied. “@CAPS5! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “well I don’t wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might!” by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didn’t get front cart the wait wasn’t even that bad."
"Some stories when needed was patient is when needed teacher I’s help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient."

"My favorite books, now a movie, have to see I it. Twilight eclips, me and my mom were heading to the movie theature and I wouldent stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 was no where to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, “@CAPS1’s one mom” “sweet,” she replied. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I was going to start saying something but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours strate. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so exided, the movie was about to start. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got @CAPS1. This was the story when I used patience."
"is quality a Patience or characterqualitytic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don’t. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got home sick and cried. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn’t stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over “stiff upper lip.” I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn’t work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. “I want to go home” I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said “@CAPS2” all grouchy. I had sniffled and said “I want to come home, I miss you.” and sniffled more. “Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.” @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1’s car. “@CAPS4 didn’t you want to stay?” @PERSON5 asked calmly. “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks."

"am not person a patient I. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ?? ?for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient."
"Well, one day saw commercial a I on the awesome xbox @NUM1.

"ride paint horse a beautiful I named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while."

"is virtue a very important Patience. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, it’ll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have."
"A time had was patient was when had to baby I sit little cousin.

There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else."

"haven’t been times many There were I was patient but I’m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that!"

"I think is ability the patience to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn’t even know that means, but if I’m patient I’ll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it."
 had was patient went had to wait I for my grandpa in the er. For his hart because his not doing very go my grandpa is in and out of the er. For my grandpa heat  everyday my grandpa has to go see has decert to chuck up his heart any that is why I am on patient.

When one thought passed by there like another set  in thinking for way I can stare at the abat and it would change. I was about to get a call home but the @CAPS1.A saved me. And I had to be understanding about that moment. Another time I had to be understanding about was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See what had happened was I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it. My mom was asleep it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before. And that was the time I had to be patient.

"is patient valve a Being. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not t worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks strait to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient."
"likes being Who patient it’s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they’re lots of times where I have had to be patiente. When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it just be patient and it will pay off."
"A time that showed patience I is when my sister broke my futon. It was the day that I had gotten it and I was in the living room watching a movie when all of a suddent I heard ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!"" I ran upstairs to find out what happend and I saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost. I showed patience by not yelling at them. I soon got another futon that isn't broken and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break! And that is my story on how I showed patience once!"

I had to pre order it with my money, so I did a bunch of work so I cut the lawn at my house then I cut other peoples lawn for two dollars so I did that for about two months at the end. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks so I did just that. I waited and bought some other stuff with the left over money and the game finaly came in the mail. that’s a time I use patients to wait for something."
"Have had ever patients enough you to deal with @NUM1 screaming  kids. I,can proudly say that i can. It all started when my uncle steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed alot of help so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem was there where @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But,it didnt take long  for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. So all of the @NUM1 kids start fighting. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was atleast a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn’@CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @NUM1 hours I’d had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. By now we had been driving about @NUM7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patients I had. After that I dont think that I want to go on a roadtrip again."
 Patience is when  have problems you and don’t complain. You need patience  at an amusment park to wait in all the lines. Patience is not complaining about being board on a long car ride. You need to be patience to  fish or to be rewarding and it can save others head aches. You want always be streesd if you are patient. So you should always be patient it can make your life so much easier long  lines wont seem so long  fishing is very rewarding for patince.

I was a hot day and I was ready to go my cool and big house and relax and chillout. You all know how old people are they walk slow and talk to much.

"was day the final Today of tryouts. The deciding day .Tryouts we over I patiently waited for the @CAPS2 to hand out the envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I didn’t know if could handle this. “@CAPS1 until you’ve left the building to open your envelope,” @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said. “@CAPS3’s only fair .If everyone opens them in here then people who don’t make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didn’t make @CAPS3 feel even more bummed and left out .Be patient and @CAPS1 until you leave the building.” she called my name .I came up and grabbed my envelope .She dismissed us .some girls opened their envelopes right away .But, they didn’t make @CAPS3 .karma .I waited until I got outside. I could barely @CAPS1 .I needed to know but I had to @CAPS1 .Patience isn’t such a lovely thing always. l opened my envelope. I made the team! I was so excited and I was glad I had the patience to @CAPS1 and be surprised."

"One time were chipmunks two twin there, were names chipmunks @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 always had patience A.J not so much. One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed up there camping gear and headed farther into the woods it was around dusk when they reached were they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire, @LOCATION1 started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how there mom and dad had taught them. As l said in the first part @LOCATION1 has no patience so he kept on trying but after awile he stopped he would hit the rocks together once and it wouldn’t start so @PERSON1 tried in @NUM1 minute he got it started. A.J. didn’t care he got the acorns and started cookin. But every time he’d only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds so he tried and tried finally he just stopped well it @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes, @LOCATION1 was really mad now so they went to bed. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning he found @LOCATION1 cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient."
"Patience is about whaiting and having what for staff you want like if wo anythingnt I Patience is that you have to what before you get it. So patience, it means that you have to what in a good maner"
"Patience is about whayouing and having what for staff get want like if I wont anything Patience is that get have to what before get it you. So patience, it means that you have to what in a good maner"
 Once was taking test a I it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.
"was @LOCATION2 @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, It. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. So we sat around till all of they were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said “why did you get of line?” “I am scaryed.” “ I want to go on it though.” “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I said. We waited for a hour. I sat on the bench and @CAPS4 said” @CAPS1 we go on the ride?” “@CAPS2 we @CAPS1” my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That’s when @CAPS4 said “I @CAPS1 wait.” “@CAPS3 lets get it over with.” @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now."
 One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & taught him I how to pitch. @PERSON1 easly devoloped a nice windup and delivery but the arin angle was off. But this didn’t stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said “no!” @CAPS2 time went on @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing @NUM1 mph fasiball at a cetcher. On day’s that he’s unaccurate he doesn’t gave he keeps trying and doesn’t wine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to some seltons patience.

"means being Patience understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4’d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didn’t belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “@CAPS3!” I shouted, “I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop” I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night. “@NUM1 minets till midnight” @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me “That’s impossible” I told her. “You can make it.” @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. “@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen” how is it going to end” @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. “@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad” @CAPS10 asked. “I guess not” I answerd sheepishly. “Being patient payed off’ @CAPS10 lectured. I didn’t reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that I’m a little better at being patient things will be a lot better."
"One boring old rainy afternoon asked mom my I to take me to a place called modern, if you don’t know what that is asked’ll tell you. Well modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love, a spote park mony and tree stuff. I went there with my mom I told her she doesn’t have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stared well I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me cheered me and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met."

"is boy a young @PERSON1 with a bladder of a squirrel and hboy waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited for his turn. @PERSON1 was in the middle of the line behind five people. @PERSON1 was a head of six people that were all doin the pee-pee dance. He learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it. @PERSON1 learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes."
"'s gotta hurtThat! every buy to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. After is prang it l had to go to the doctor witch as all ways you have to wait forever, but sometimes its worth it. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. but I finally got them back and discover it was only a sprang. After it got all better my football coach said that I will only be a back up in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game."

"is one Patience of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesn’t understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you."
"has to have Everyone patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. People always say “Patience is vertile.” @CAPS1 need a lot of patience for what they do espacially if they are @NUM1 grade teacher. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Now if you have a job that you focus on adults your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”"
"My neighbor was very patient wkilledn killed point buck that @NUM1 he for tkilled first time! He was??? and proud that he caught this beautiful white tail deer!. He said he`d never been this proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered my neighbors’ face when he told me, I was so happy for him. If I had the money I would have got something for @NUM1-point buck. When I got to sec the head my jaw dropped it was the most beautiful deer I’ve ever seen."
 Once when were supposed my dad to go me to the races. But I had to wait until my dad and he said he was getting of work at @NUM1 oclock and that’s the time the races starts. It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasn’t going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. I was so happy. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. So I got to meet the drivers and sit in there cars. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. @CAPS1 they did figure eight boat race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said “no w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.” @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2.
 When had was at cedar point had lot a I of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. My parent didn’t have patience then but my friend I did. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen.
"My mom and I are are on way were to way house from sonco. We got stop by a trane, and it was going varey slow and my mom and I were waiting vary patiently but my mom, after  afew minutes wanted to ternanon but we stod  than and it was done."
"Igoing to tell ’m you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”… “sniff”, “snot. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. When you we’re a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, it’s none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, but now, I’m done. (yes!)"

"“is virtue a Patience.” I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3 he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I’ve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, @CAPS4 I wasn’t too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didn’t have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you."

"I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when couldn’t find something she couldn’t find needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat was on the on phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isn’t that patient and I learned I’m not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasn’t. That’s  the time of when I know  someone was patient."

 is one Patience of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.

"atime when had was patient was at my grandma’s house in @LOCAThadON1 my cousins and had to wait I for my grandma to get home @CAPS1 we can go to beach. After about an hour of waiting my cousin and; started to play video games to entertain ourselves @CAPS1 the time went faster my grandma had  probably worked for @NUM1 hours @CAPS1 at three- pm I decided to watch a movie I had been patient for the whole movie, at the middle of the movie my grandma got home @CAPS1 we all waited patiently till she was ready to  the beach.This was a time when I had been patient."
 The means lot a word patience of things. It can mean waiting and something and much more. It also talks a lot ??? It takes time and effort. I’@CAPS1 the type who complain a lot and I don’t have patience. Other people they don’t complain they an it. A lot of teenagers have no patience. As you get older you develop patience some adults don’t have patience it depends on if you work at it. It also depends on whether the person has gone through in life.
"My is person the most patient mother I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill it’s over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn’t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave."
"We all don`t like waiting like waiting, but have to learn we to be patient. @DATE1 @DATE1 @DATE1 when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. While still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for you flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have. To be patient in waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don’t like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do."
 My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because had check a big she that kept haveiry mastakes with it like they spelled her last name wrong so it check to be called back and retiped everytime they retipped it they would make a mastakes five times in a row and it takes a long time to prosses and we needed to pay our pills so we wouldn’t get kicked out.

 Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focpatient is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait capatiente keeps us patient from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness that’s a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.

 My story in own way about being patience ceter point when is ceter point like @NUM1 people in front of a line a there. You have to be patient in the lines because other were before you so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that you don’t want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat you have wait your turn in line so you don’t get kick out of the rides you have to wait your turn so you don’t get the secrety on you.
"My has never been type the patient brother matt of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long. We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with matt’s girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those  couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matt’s girlfriend two dollars."
 was being pationt I when was being was waiting for my own phone so was being cam text my friends and call them and more. I was also waiting for to get my own snowmoble licens so I can ride my own snowmible on the troils. Know  matter what you are always be patient.

 One day my dad and had doctor a I’s appointment at @NUM1 pm so we went there on time. Then my dad and I sat there for a while. We thought it would take a few more minutes. So we waited for @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went and asked other doctors how long is it going to take. The doctors said abott @NUM2 more minutes so we waited for @NUM2 more minutes. The doctor  still didn’t come out. We waited for @NUM5 minutes. My dad went to the doctor again. They said few more minutes we waited for @NUM2 more minutes there the doctor called us. So the doctor was @NUM7 minutes late. When we went in the room the doctor said sorry! because he was late. That’s how me and my dad were patient.
"is something Patience you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious .But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @CAPS3! @CAPS4 is the one that freaks over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4’s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!"

But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. This was going to be interesting. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. So I got up and smacked him right across the face with my fingers sliding off his check leaving bb face red with four finger mask @CAPS4’s been @CAPS1 patient ever since we start being annoying . But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. @CAPS4 got up, with his left wide open for a smack. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!"
 know person I that’s way more patient than me! That person is my sister. My sister is the most patient person you’ll ever meet. I am not patient at all.First of all when were going somewhere my sister would just sit there. I would say can we leave now.My sister is always patient! That’s why I think she’s patient.
"At time had wsa very patient when had to do I a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @NUM2 day project instead of a seven. I worked harder then @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept braking my wonderful creation. The wings would break, and I patiently had to glue them back on. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I wanted to. I used paintence, carefulness, and steady hand to finally succeed!"

 A time when I mama patient mama when went to the mall.”@CAPS1 @CAPS2” I said to was mama behind me my whoever and had come to the mall to get some @DATE1 clothes. That mall was crowded. Couldn’t nobody get in where I was getting so patient. The ever had was to understand and it was this white family walking by and they all bumped me. I was so patient waiting in one. I was just ready to left everybody when finally came our time. That was time when I was patient. I was so proud of myself I held at in. The @CAPS3.
"A was laying eggs momma bird. She layed @NUM1 butiful, blue, perfect eggs. Days went by, and the eggs did not hatch. The momma bird got upset. She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""@CAPS1 be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the @NUM2 oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, ""@CAPS2 can't I fly yet"" and momma said,"" @CAPS1 be patient."""
"was @CAPS1 I excited to get my first ipad. But, there was a very long line. @CAPS1, my mom kept on telling he to be patient. @CAPS1, I just stand there quietly. Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said “what kind do you want?” @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all. Then my said “stop listing to that music” @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched tv and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That is the time I was being patient."
"I believe that is characteristic a good patience in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in on ????? would have lot of people wait in line to the ??? , if you're patient you would wait but if you're not, you might leave the line and get out. People might you now when you are patient??? Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. Though wait things ??? , which is not nice. Im conclusion I believe that being patient is very important in life."
"was @DATE1 the It and I, @PERSON1, had applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I had applied in @DATE2 and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION2. From the beginning of the @DATE1 I had checked the mail box every day. Every day as I ran down the drive way I hoped that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one moment at the climat of the movie when you think the main character will make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and l was eating lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me. Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience."
 A time wanted was patient was when wanted really game a I called x-men @CAPS3 wolver in and my mom said wanted had to what until @CAPS1 came strolling down the road. I can understand why she said that because we were a lttle shorf on cash at that time so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer. After a few week had past I forgot all about the game then on @CAPS1 day my sister and I got down stairs so fast then when we were oozning gifts I noticed a gift with my name on it. I go grab it and I opened it and it was it x-men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and tow other games that I wanted offer that I go up to my room grab my @CAPS5 and headphones pop in x-me @CAPS3 and played it all day long

"Here is a way that had to be I patient, and we all know that??? has to be patient with others. ??? Yes, it was my birthday. I wasn’t thinking of my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no I was thinking of getting the money, first present no money. Second present, yes, there was money. And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldn’t wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldn’t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, if its along time, but its also a good thing to do because it pays with every time."

"At one @CAPS2 in left would have to be you patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go. Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient."
 In my opinion being patient is when waiting turn waiting your for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time.
"One time had to use I patience when we were driving to @CAPS1. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (@NUM1 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @NUM4 ocklock @CAPS2 time and,in @LOCATION1 it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am. I was very tired of being patient, I’m not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!"

"is thing a hard Patience to have, but there thing rewards to having it. I had a teacher that no one could remember to gave us our report card in band class. So after a few weeks I made a bet with him that if he didn’t bring us our report card the next day he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally. It was the end of the year. And he still didn’t have them. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said?? yes are only suppose to give me and  he told me “ the second one is ? being to patient.”"

"is thing a valuable Patience. Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do @CAPS1 practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It take patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn’t when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting."
"When was seven about I And my mom seven pregnant with my @NUM1 sister. It was the night before she had her. We were all asleep. When my mom started to scream we all went into her room my dad asked her what was going on she said “she coming” my dad raced to the car put it in to gear and left without us and my mom who was about to have a baby. Then when my dad relized he forgot us. So when he got home to pick us up. It was already morning they took us to a room. They prepared my mom up. Me amd my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the deveiring room we were so paitient it took over an hour to get her out. when they were stiching my mom up the brought my little sister to get all cleand up. When we could see her through the window. I had to see her get her first bath, shots And when the put those patches on her I had thought she was an @CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. And we all liked that name. I was so @CAPS3 that day."
"is something Patience not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you don’t  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs. I’m not very patient so thank goodness for patience!"
"The was I whene patient whene time I went to the @CAPS1.B.I @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of training, he was there for like @NUM1 months. At the end if they made  it through they got a award. So there was kind of a lot of  people. We had to dress really nice. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didnt even know. The worst part was they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave. That was the time I had to be patient."
"One sunny beutful day I went out and was driving my glad around and all of a sudden my mom yelled at me and said was going to go she get my new good in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and was going said I couldn’t go @CAPS5 I sat down waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting. Then I decided to play playstation @NUM1 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) @CAPS5 I was playing far two hours strait, and then I decided to go watch @CAPS6 assassain  (@CAPS7) . After that was com I went back to play in playstation @NUM1(p.s.@NUM1. ), again. played it for another hour. Then all of a sudden I hear beep, beep, @CAPS5 I look out the window, and it was my . @CAPS1 ma. Then we talked bout the new qlad and then I hear beep, beep and it was my . my . new @CAPS8!. Then I ran out took it out and roud it for like @NUM3 hours strait. That is how I had patient for about @NUM4 to @NUM5 hours long. I was proud of myself after I was done riding my new @CAPS8."
"is story a This about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me."
"Patience, whats the first you that comes to hearr mind when hear word that you? Waiting? I know that’s the main word in my mind. Here is a story when I was very patient. Every kid dreads meap testing it was @DATE1 and we have to be completely silent. It’s hard enough to be quite. But it’s harder when your next to your friends, and your a girl. We had to do meap writing, writing is the most wrost for me. But when I was done I felt really good and quiet for everyone else. That’s the story when I had to be patient."
"is ways many There to be patient like while your wating in the lunch line to pat or when you line up to leav the room. Heres a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was talking to some and I wanted to go right away but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient."
"To me,  is one patient of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. “Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?” I asked wondering if it would easy to get it. “@CAPS2 buddy we just ran out.” @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess I’ll have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didn’t grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort."
 means  to me trying Patients your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @NUM1 then we finally were second in line. The kids in frount of us offered to get in frount of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid. But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time.
"was day the first Today I day patient. I couldn’t believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said “@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you don’t get this line moving then I’m going to have to talk to the waiterger. All the guy said “I’m so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before you”. “@CAPS2 are you kidding me” she yelled as she stopped way and that’s when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I’m inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said “Do deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be inpatient again."

"am lot   patient   at school a I of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher’s or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I’d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one."

Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book.

"Being patient means that you are understand and tolerant a patient experiences difficulties person without complaining. I’m writing about a time when my friend @PERSON1 was patient. “@CAPS1” @PERSON1 said to @ORGANIZATION1 as he was leaving to spend his whole @DATE1 in the upper pininusula of @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 were dating since the beginning of the year. She was sad @CAPS2 weeks had passed and @CAPS4 was the beginning of a new school year .She had been patient all @DATE1 @CAPS3 to see him again. Finally the first day of school came she skipped up to him and he @CAPS3 called a way .Couple of confused weeks late she said to him are you jumping  me or ?? ?He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient waiting for an answer @CAPS4 never came. Finally she decided to jump him but, she never did. So @CAPS5 gabby and me did . @CAPS4 far her on the outside she was mad but on the inside she was probably screaming today she has “moved” on and now is dating a boy named @PERSON2."

My mom was very patient with me all she did was incorege me to move faster she tried to motiveit me and help me get redy for school she brought me my breakfast and put all my books into my back back. I thanked her all the end of the day for being so patient with me. That was the day someone was patient with me.
"is story a This about a vampire named @CAPS1 who goes to a regular middle school. It was the first day of school and @CAPS1 was waiting in line for his schedule and later combonaiton. And this line was really long. @CAPS1 was late on his first day and he had to get in the way back of the line. The person in front of him kept complaining and @CAPS1 was getting ??. This will take forever!” complained the person in front. “@CAPS3,shut up,man. I dont like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining? “exclaimed @CAPS1. Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. This was not a good sign. @CAPS1 stopped talking and just waited in line . After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music at  his ipod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the  front of the line. Then something bad happened. “@CAPS3 this isn’t my schedule!” said a blonde girl. The person who was giving  out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule. So @NUM1 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If @CAPS1 hadn’t patience,he wouldn’t have standed the @NUM4 minutes in line! Good thing he brought his ipod @CAPS5!"
"am not person a very patient I ???. However there was a time to my ??? where I was extremely patient. I was in @NUM1th grade and was doing a thing called ??? Mrs. Bowos @NUM2nd grade. We would go down there ???. As you probably know, @NUM2nd graders are not very good readers but there was one girl who was not good at all. She needed ??? help from everybody @PERSON1 would sent the down in the ??? to help the girl ???. She struggled a lot and never would she rent she would shut the book as though it on the flame ???. But that was patient and everytime she ??? every time she stoped reading. I would make her keep going. Every time she out it on the floor, I would ???. Eventually the girl saw that it didn’t accomplish anything ??? this, so, she just read. Now I was to be patient with how slow she was reading. I.P she didn’t know a word I would help her sound it out. The girl kept getting better and better at reading until she don’t need me anymore. But iwas proud of myself for being patient for once."
"are times many There I was patient, but this one was not to long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the meap. I just sat there finished, just read and drawed. It was absolutely boring, lame, and seconds felt like hours. It was terrible, but I didn’t complain I just sat there and did nothing. And that was probably worst time when I want to talk but couldn’t."

"is quality a Patience that some people have and some people don’t. it shows your character to people if your patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. After I was finished with that I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!"

 The one timom I was patient is when my took me mom to go get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there the parking lot was full I mean cars was so close you could hardly get in and out without scratching someones car. My mom parked across the streets the streets. When we got in there it was at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 people it parked. People were standing so close to each other you would know their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were parked like dardine. It was hot and smelled like must. We picked a ticket with @NUM3 on and they were on @NUM4. We waited for two hours. My mum wanted to leave. When they got to our number I was sleep. Wile we was in there I lost ten pounds.

"uses patience Everybody sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball. There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 in particular. My first one is when people don’t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don’t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on. There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on. My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team. We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over. The newest member of the team can not make a shot. She doesn’t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn’t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship. I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too. I’m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be? Probably not on any teams or in any clubs."
"Once my friend @PERSON1 was very patient,waited @NUM1 he  months for twaited xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. He quietly waited day after day for the game.But one day after school it arrived."
"Patient people people the people that tolerate life. If you’re not patient you won’t get through to welI.I learned this when I was little. There was this thing I wanted and I was going to drive me, but just before I got out the door, the phone rang. My @CAPS2 picked up, “@CAPS1 oh hi @PERSON1 no not busy @CAPS6 did not! no!” and it went on for so long and every minute I kept getting less and less patient, I finally burst out. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “hold on @PERSON1 I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and walked away. That’@CAPS4 why patient is important"
