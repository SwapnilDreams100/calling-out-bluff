"I going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair, we had fun, we saw a ride we wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.” @CAPS1 get on another ride then”. We already tried the other rides,” my father said. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didn’t desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. Just don’t think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you’ll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride"
"One time I was patience it was when I wanted a phone I didn’t get a phone I knew I was gonna get one someday .The day finally came to get my phone @DATE1 it was my @NUM1 birthday .I was opening presents and I didn’t know what I was getting but the last and find big present was a cell phone .So I called my friend on it and  she said whose phone are you calling from I said my .I couldn’t believe I could be so patience for such a long time .I was so happy that I could be so patience for  so long.

" It was @NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like that. It was at the cernical, I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the life gaurd instructer for not letting him on the ride. S was patient waiting for him to stop. I did not complane or argue about the man who was wasting our time."
"Im writing about the time I was patient at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. the @LOCATION2 huggets in @LOCATION1. We were in a huge traffic jam. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a @NUM1 ½ hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt and me were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the @NUM1 ½  hour drive. When we got to the arena the @LOCATION1 and @CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. That was the most best birthday ive ever had. Now I don’t think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now that in order."
"Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. Her and her brother are both very patient. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1 dad had already applied fro the army. His dad has been their most of his life. Two years later @CAPS1 sister, my best friend was born. Their dad was with them til @CAPS2 exie was about @NUM2 I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 new why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind because she has really bad A.D.H.D. so doesn’t know why she didn’t see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @PERSON1 became to be in the in the army and also it was the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When their came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @PERSON2 is very fragile and he would try play with her and tickle her and it hurt @PERSON2 and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but it didn’t work he would just keep going and acting like he didn’t hear her. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks hes nicer."
 So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted. After those people were done he never call me up so he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me wait until he came out the restroom then five more people came in so that’s when my mom called my phone and asked me was I done because I been up their from @NUM1 to @NUM2 and she said go to some one else chair because was was about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick my stuff will be leaving at @NUM3 a.
" While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or,when are we leaving? Everytime I got, just be patient hunny. So, I tried it wasn’t really working.We finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said “daddy when are we gonna be there?” I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pots. So throughout this I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster."
 A time of when I was patient was when me & my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to alow us to get our first puppy. We waited & waited for about an hour while my parent were discussing if we should or shouldn’t. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first they said no & we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad’s decision. My sister then made a face my dad couldn’t resist. So he then said yes. We were going out of town in two days so we couldn’t get him the next day. The next day came & my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bring the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went & got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. we all fell love with @CAPS1 & he is all of ours new snuggle buddy!
"My sister is very patient unlik my brothers and me. Well my sibling and me had are proggress reports coming and I was so excited to see what I got, and my brothers were anxious and we work always both a mom saying when are they coming did you them. But my sister was always calm and patient. Then the day they arrived we then got nervous except @PERSON1. The reason why she is patient is because she trys to keep off her mind by sleeping or reading. But back to report cards we opened them and then everyone was happy even @CAPS1 because we got good grades"
" I bent backwards tried kicking over and feel! Errg! I stood back up and asked @PERSON1 my coach, “@CAPS1 my shoulders right?” @CAPS2 @CAPS1 your shoulder the kick over. “@CAPS3 got it” I said. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. The look on my mom face could never be replaced @CAPS4 was so proud of me. Then I @CAPS4 ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said “thank you for being so patient"
" One time me and @CAPS3 dad had to wait an hour to two hours that way I could sign up for football. For basket ball sign up when  I lived  in @CAPS3 pleasant @CAPS4 took a long time to sign up for basket ball  because we had to get @CAPS3 number put on the @PERSON3 size of shirt for me and @CAPS3 last name I also had to get basket ball short’s @CAPS3 size. When I player soccer for the @PERSON4 soccer team. @CAPS4 took one-hour because there was so many kind’s that wanted to play soccer like @CAPS5, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS6 and me. When @CAPS3 mom took me to the sign up’s year @CAPS4 took almost three hours @CAPS7 to sign up and set picture’s taken end paragraph @NUM3. Every school day @CAPS3 friends and I wait like twenty @NUM4 thirty mines @CAPS7 to get a lunch or a kecreoml soriss roles ,zebra cars ,or gaanola  bars. @CAPS4 takes alons time before we can @NUM5 out site to play football, soccer, volleyball, and kick ball. The end"
"There was one time I was patient when my little brothers play station wasn’t working so it took a while to get use to it. It was an @TIME1 and my little brother had jus finished eating and he wanted to play his @CAPS1 but he was having a hard time turning it on but the problem was that some of his games were scratched up. But the next day we bought him a lot of other games that were brand new. So as he tried the games he still couldn`t do it. So than he asked me if I can help him so I helped him but it still didn`t work until I cleared up the play station than we had to wait patiently and than finaly at??? but  my little brother and I say “ work, work, work, work” until it went on. Then this day we still say that for the @CAPS1 can work"

 We had to wait @NUM2 hours just to get out of traffic but mom didnt freek out or anything
Tic tak times tiking  I was patient one time it was in the doctors office my oppment was at two and I had to wait and wait and wait and wait I sat there until it was @NUM1 and they finnly called me in. So I was trying so hard to be patient and trust me it is not easy for me at least because I can’t even sit there for @NUM2 minitues and stay still I have to move aroud so it was hard to sit there  lisening to the sound tik tok for a while. And that was the time I was pacient it was hard to belive but I did it. The hardest part was when you here one off those tiker clocks go tik tok and I was stinn there for a while now you absolutely now that for some people incuding me
Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know lur lne being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away from mom il just not pretty. But one time l really had to use my patience. Socio. We waited about another @NUM2 minutes maybe @NUM3 minutes and yes! It started working again. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting debating on wheiner or not. We wanted to stay or leave we ended up staying and waiting for which seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the space snottle. Finally. The out was over! Using my patience and waiting inline forever really payed off in the end. It was a great ride
 One store only had girl       clothes which I hated. But I didn't say anything after that since I was so patient my my asked me where to you want to go? I said to best buy I got a game it was colloge football oq. When you have patient's it can pay off in the end and always have patiens where ever you go or are always have patients
"Patience is important in life. Something when you don’t have patience things tend to go wrong and that’s not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didn’t have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didn’t work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some people who didn’t have patience. But if they did that wouldn’t of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not."
" Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me and willing to hold off grading me until and the time catch up in their class I think I'll make it"
 I am writing about a time when I was patient. One time I had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me. We were waiting on the bus to come but I was very angry because it seemed like it took forever to come. So my mother said “@CAPS2 stop complanning and be patient @CAPS1 serious!” so as soon as I sat down the bus came!

"That is the time I was to be patient.  Hope you enjoyed I am not a very patient person very rarely have I been patient. But, there is sometimes I was. I still remember three years ago when I was in @NUM1 grade my whole day was full of patience. I was getting picked up early from school because that night I was going to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news. My friend went a few days before and said it was a good @ORGANIZATION1."
"The time when I was patient was when we went to the mall to go get my customized hat. I went to the store called lio's. So I said I wanted saad on their he did everything then I asked how long he said @NUM1 mineuts. We went around the mall and went back to the store that took like @NUM2 to @NUM3 mineuts. So I asked the guy is it done he said ""not yet"" I was watching him doing another guys hat. So he stopped the other guys hat, I didn't wanna make a scene and yell at the guy so I'm waiting and waiting until he's finally done with the hat that took about an hour."
"This is my way of patience: patience is power without patience where would you be in the time of waiting on your house to be built? Yaid probalay be going crazy because you don’t want   to be living in a trashy trailer, camper or even a house! What about if your in a doctor’s office for @NUM1 hours! Yes your going to be agitated! But, see if you have patience your going to be able to wait patience is power!"
" So one day @CAPS1 wanted to go to the village and see all her people and they were very happy to see her they yelling her name llola lolal and telling her that is was the best queen they ever had. Then after they stop yelling her name @CAPS1 saw a cute and strong preteen prince and has name was @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 fell in love and went over there and said hello and he said @CAPS4. Then @CAPS1 said do you want to come to my place and have diner and he said yes. Were do you live and @CAPS1 said in the big place he said ok see you at six. Then a month later the were boyfriend and girlfriend everything was going good. @CAPS1 new that if @CAPS1 ask him @CAPS3 would not work out so @CAPS1 wait and @CAPS1 waited some more and he tell didn’t ask her so the next day @CAPS1 went out with her friends @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, feanne and @CAPS5 and they went to the @CAPS6 and they sat in the mud bath and they were talking about how @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 were doing and @LOCATION2 said they were doing good. @CAPS3 is just won’t ask me to marrie him I don’t think he wants to ask me but we liveing together. The next day @CAPS1 @CAPS1 came home and all her friend and family were in her house and in front of everyone he ask her to marrie him and @CAPS1 said yes and everyone was happy for her and he said I was going to ask you I just wanted @CAPS3 be one you will never forget and @CAPS1 ask her friends if they knew and they said yes everyone knew we just couldn’t tell you.

 Every day I have this kid sit by me on the bus. He is annoying every day but I listen to him anyway. We usely et a long but we debated about things sometime. He tells out rages story about @CAPS1 and snipers. He’s not really my friend but he come one to talk to.
"Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient."
" Sometimes I lose my patience when something take too long. In @ORGANIZATION1 seriously  there was an event called @CAPS1. It was raising and many people wanted to see if @CAPS2 would close down. The rain inocaculously did stop but I had to wait until @TIME1. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was a unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with queued squeaky noises. Man, I’m glad I was patient enough."
" Look the last room they had but I was really angry patient and really we a room the next day we went to the @ORGANIZATION1 to stay we were going to the water park/musment park there was a new ride"" the scoping tail butt we had to wait for @NUM1 hour to go on that ride and I was really patient but my mom was getting tired and mad because  it took so long then the next day it rained and rained so we went to the indoor fool at our hotel but we couldnt go in because there were in many people so we had to wait but I wasnt patient because I wanted to go swimming  the almost a halve hour we got to go swimming then the next day we had to leave and this time it took almost two days to get us back home the time & we got there was at @TIME1 I was patient enough to help my parents get all the stuff in our house then we finally got to go to bed I was so happy."
Supper beast patience I was coming here from school are day on the  going bus so @CAPS1 what felt live  @CAPS2 I finals got have I ran inside I saw my high school bro with a box of pop I asked  blare here did you set the mong  for that is allows need mong . You wouldn’t ques what he said I took it out of ur walles . As  I thought with ma ??? @NUM1 sade was friends. So I ren aut vumpt in the arr purched him right in the nose .I try to run he grass ???
 A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me now to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didn’t always correct things. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words “practice makes perfect” she let me choose from her best string selection. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her.
 One time at the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I was getting some arrows but no one was there to ring up my arrows. So instead of ringing the bell a hundred times I just waited there quitley and patiently. I was waiting for about @NUM1 min for some to come and when some one did come they said thank you for being so patienet and ringed me up so I could leave.
 It was the longest line I ever stood in and I was very patient
"“left! Right! High kick left, roundhouse sight! The boys arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs striking the bag with tremendous power! “@CAPS1!” the old man yells “my boy.” @CAPS2 says “you are lacking patience. The first one hits him in the head, but the boy kicks the second one and busts it open. The boy learned to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first."
"A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. Normally I’m  not a patient person at all ,but when this  happened I had to be patient .I’m  glad @DATE1 that I was  patient because now I am more patient then I was before .My mom is proud  of my behavior ,because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed @CAPS2 .now I can imagine me being patient.i mean I’m not glad my mum get hurt but I’m glad of my consequence of the problem .After the big accident hapend I have learned  that everyone needs a little bit of patience like me that is one example about how I thought of  I small were here away ever  been patience ,without my mom."
" @CAPS3 brother, @PERSON1 ran out to the car running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was,"" @CAPS2 need to talk."" @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded."" @CAPS4 about at @NUM1?"" I knew @CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 got an in-school suspension, around me. If @CAPS3 brother hadn't of cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 divulged into his story causing tension in the air. ""@CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really very friend poured water purposely on @CAPS3 sweatshirt, @CAPS12 I went to tell the principle, @CAPS3 @LOCATION1""  ""@CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do,"" @CAPS3 @CAPS15 interrupted. "" @CAPS9. @CAPS12 the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started to follow me, and I felt threatened.""  I held @CAPS3 breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not @CAPS10. Started punching him?"" ""@CAPS13, yes."" @CAPS14 admitted miserably. ""@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,""@CAPS15 scolded. ""I know, I know now. I 'm sorry,"" @CAPS3 brother shuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, ""would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?"" ""@CAPS16""I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day."

" I was @NUM1 yrs old when I got a as. @NUM2 days went by and still nothing, a week went by and a ups truck stopped at our house dropped off the package and left. I opened it to find pampered chef stuff in it. I was really angry! @NUM3 weeks went by and… nothing I was upset that I didn’t really didn’t know it I was gonna get about it. And that was the time I was patient see ya"
"Patience a helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient, waiting calmly or being content. A patient; A person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types of patient. Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? I’m going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor’s office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, that’s why. The morning probably wasn’t really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctor’s office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said “I have an appointment for my son.” And the lady at the front window said “the @NUM1 appointment?’’ “@CAPS1 that’s the one” said my dad .” “Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined” @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me “you know what? You’re a patient patient!” I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine."
" My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours untill we got there. Then we checked are bags went throug securely, and went to go and find our plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours untill the plane came. That plane was delayed to! So we had to wait a few hours again untill the plane came. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there."
" After me and my brother got home from school we left to go to @LOCATION2 as we where travelling  we seen a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there . We where going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1. Like watch the sea @PERSON2’s ,waves, and  look at the buildings there. That’s my example of patience."
"Patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. Taking a three hour carride is a perfect example of patience. Exactly like what I experienced. As we packed our suitcases for @CAPS1 city, I @CAPS2't contain myself. I was already packed up but mom and dad were standing. After they finished cooking dad was carrying the last of the bags @CAPS4 their bedroom to the complain he notice me, setting patiently at the look. He thanked me, saying ""@CAPS5 for being so patient, and just for that, mom and have surprise. For you. He set down the sultans, and briskly walked over to a white plastic had the suddenly pulled at a rectangular favor it was the some in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7?????? it wash ? you????????. This just goes to show that prince really says off. !"

 It was a fight cause l wanted to walk and they said no. Then I got to go home
"That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Lets go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to @LOCATION1. This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the @NUM1 children. Which ment we couldn’t get up, @CAPS1 food, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the @CAPS4! Flying experience I’ve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops till we got to the @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. It’s a : memory I will never forget. The stuborn little smerk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her “chicken little.”"
 We were at ceder point waiting to ride too thrill dragster. We had just got there the first thing we decided to do was ride the top thrill dragseter but the line was about a three hour wait we went anyway.  We had just fineshed our first hour of waiting but it felt like three. after anthor hour my stomach started to growl I checked my watch it was @NUM2 we had got here at @NUM3 I was starving and tiered but I stayed finaly an hour later it was our turn when I got off I knew it had been worth it to be patient. In conclusion I learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life.
 When I had to @CAPS1 patient one of my most memorable time when. I was extremly angry. It was the same guitar I had sent @CAPS4 I was even more angry. So again we sent the guitar @CAPS4 hoping that we would finally get the wright one. It was @DATE1 and I got my guitar. I was so happy and this time it was not angry I was so happy when my guitar will come and will @CAPS1      @DATE3 ice wich is my birthday
"I am never paitent, but which I am it is only once and a while. Sitting down and not doing a thing drives me to be insane. When I’m doing nothing and it is really quiet. I get really bad headaches. In school for example and I’m waiting I get rigily like I tap my foot at tap my pencil and my desk. Tap ???everything things like that. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctors office, or flying on a plane for a while can get real boring. I get buggy when I’m paitent, and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than @NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get real bad. I can’t be paitent very long or I get buggy. One way I help myself is playing sports and doing things constantive."
 I saw someone @CAPS1 patient the got to a rest runt before I did and den I orderd my food and it came.
"When I was seven I played on a basketball team named the @CAPS1. We where playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship and I wasn’t in the game. Without me playing my team was down by @NUM1 and my coach didn’t put me in yard. I had to take a technical shot which is when you are at the foul line and its just you, the ball and the rim. If I wasn’t patient in this game we wouldn’t have won and I wouldn’t have gotten the trophy to take home with me."
"The I was patient. One day my mom and I went to the eye doctor. It was my first time going there. We went to this lady and wait for the doctor call us. We sat for @NUM1 minutes band then we hear the doctor calling my name. We go inside the doctors room and I sit down he does all this things. Later he yells us that we have to meet one more doctor. We sat down again and we waited. Then we hear my name again so we go. The worst thing was that I saw a medicine on the table and I was really scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that she took the medicine and was going through it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she through the medicine in my eyes it burned a little. When she came back she me that was it, and we were done there. I thought to myself, that wasn`t so bad."
"Patient, that’s all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for it to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat"

"A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said her @CAPS1 was coming. @CAPS4 grandma was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets cost a lot of money. It is @NUM1 dollar. That was a lot of money. She @CAPS11't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I could not wait. She didn't come. I said, ""@CAPS2 why didn't @CAPS3 come."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 said,"" @CAPS5 she is coming you just have to be patient."" @CAPS6, I said. ""@CAPS2 is she here yet"" I said. ""@CAPS8, @CAPS5 be patient she will be here tomorrow."" ""@CAPS6, I understand.""I gave up I thought that she was not coming. So @CAPS4 mom called @CAPS4 godmom. She said it was @CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I love @ORGANIZATION1. I so good. I asked @CAPS4 @CAPS2. @ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger. I said @CAPS13 to @CAPS4 uncle and @CAPS4 mom said she was not coming. I told @CAPS4 mom I was not giving up she was coming. So I said I am hanging up. So I air hustled. @CAPS4 mom said to @CAPS4 uncle @CAPS14 ""should I get her something to eat. I thought she ment @CAPS4 grandmother. So I thought for a while her who is her. I said, @PERSON1's?  For a dog? She said know dog food. So @CAPS4 mom got me from @CAPS4 god mothers house I could not walk because @CAPS4 legs, back, arm and every part that I @CAPS11 move on @CAPS4 body hurt.

She live in south caroline so yeah. The is @CAPS4 writing. That is when I was patient. So I could wait for @CAPS4 mom's @CAPS1."
"A time when I was pacient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was  babysitting were acting up. It hard for me to get them to calm down. But , I noticed that if I was pacient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be pacient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being pacient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being  a lot when  I was babysitting them the next time too"
"Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. “@CAPS1’s that?” I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2’t it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom”, I said over and over again. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom."
 Once apoon a time there was a place called unpaciente land. But on grumpy lane lived a little girl namend @ORGANIZATION1. She was the most patient girl ever. One day @ORGANIZATION1 went to get her hair cut “at mtso fast saloon!” When @ORGANIZATION1 got there everyone was screaming at @CAPS1 the hair cutter and @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said hey if you want your hair to look good sit down and be quiet and everybody did
" I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient."
I had a @CAPS1  @CAPS4 was so good my sister @PERSON1 said “@CAPS2 I get some”  I said “ @CAPS3 you @CAPS2” @CAPS4 was a miracle so I was driving her car at the gasstation .
"There was a time I was patient for a whole day! It was @CAPS1 eve and it was about @NUM1, meaning I just woke up, I ate breakfast brush my teeth after I got out of the shower. By now I would have probably ask my mom @NUM2 times if I could open one present, but on this day I hadn’@CAPS6 ask he once yet. As I start walking down the stairs I hear a @CAPS3!! So I start running down the stairs as fast as I could knowing my two @NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They meet @CAPS7 at the counter and ask @CAPS7. “@CAPS4 many times have you ask to open a present?” “@CAPS5” I said. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over I ran over to my friend house across the street to play basketball.V. take a shower then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1 and we heat down stairs and as soon as I saw all the present I scream @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day."
"I showed patience before. Two years ago.  I worked at my @CAPS1’s home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ???  he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1 that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing.” I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off"
"Middleton middle school, I’m one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, I’m new here, but you @MONTH1 think that I’m a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 I’m not going to say this twice; patience is a vurture. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1’s class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. “@CAPS2. “my name’s @CAPS4.” @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. “@CAPS2.” I said back. “I’m @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.” “@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1. “@CAPS11 let me show you around.” “@CAPS12!” I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends,but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boy’s name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just woulden’t let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, “@CAPS13’s @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this. “@CAPS16 you just don’t have any patience!” I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 coulden’t understand. “@CAPS4 wait!” I cried but I hat to run after her. “@CAPS20, please you don’t get @CAPS13. You can’t keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know your trying to protect me, but its @CAPS17. Have you ever had of patience before?” I asked ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. “@CAPS21.” @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13 and we never had a problem again."
"I was on my way to tennisee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1 and my granpa, and granma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6 where driving in to different cars I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 white mersadies. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1’s gold minny van. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. @CAPS6 were in front of @LOCATION1, as @CAPS6 slowed down @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over.” @CAPS6 drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. @CAPS6 stopped at an autin shop @CAPS6 were the only people there, the mucanic told us to get everything @CAPS6 needed out of the car. After @CAPS6 cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto thue lift and that when I saw the gradge for the first time. It smelled like gas everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minny van and the gradge for about two hours. Some of the other mocanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wronge with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, it didn’t help. The day before @CAPS6 left @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10 gardge for a tune up. @CAPS6 weren’t sure. After sitting at the shop for about three hours I got hungry, so did every one else so @CAPS6 went to a restorunt across the street for loneh. @CAPS2 stay at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. @CAPS6 are going to have to go back home!! I was so upset, after all @CAPS7 waiting @CAPS6 have to go back home. I sprained my rist, so @CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio shop was a wallmart so @CAPS6 stopped there got a bandage for my wrist, and pick out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a starwars book. @CAPS6 read them on the wag home in @CAPS12 car"
"Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, I’ll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least I’ll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I’m not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, I’m going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she’s transferred everything, I’ve proved I’m deticated, I’ve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I’ve been watching the neighbor’s pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I’m working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn’t sure. I’ll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I’ll have to continue everything I’m doing now. So, I won’t be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!"
"I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my for-wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home exept for my grandma, my dad don’t want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not their. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore."

"“When do ve get the xbox!” I asked @CAPS1. “@CAPS2 hours,” he replied. “@CAPS3!” “yes.” @CAPS2 hours…. I thought, this is gonna feel like a week. First, I got on the computer. After ten minutes I got off because nothing was ???. Next I looked at the t.v guide. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I did…, I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide still nothing. I just turned the t.v on. A @PERSON1 just ended. “@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1,” the @CAPS8 commercial said. “@CAPS10 see this,” I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought. It was a no color @PERSON1 that was about a police official and his son. After watching four hours of the @PERSON1, I heard the goings door open. “@CAPS15 wake him up.” @CAPS1 whispered"
"A time I was patient. I played @CAPS4 ps @NUM2 for a cupul of minutes it was @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 left early so @CAPS7 could Do some thing when @CAPS7 got there.

 I was patient when I was going to cedar point. We took a bas it took seven @CAPS1. So my friend @PERSON1 decided in watch movies on the @CAPS2. We were still a long way from cedar point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually we both fell asleep. This it the time I waited patiently.  Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait now longer. This helped in my future.
"A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part. They are hard and take a while. When we started some people rushed as fast as they can to get done. I took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time so you shoud use the most of your time to make everything good. This means that you should look over your answers again and make sure you have it correct. When I done with the writing section, I went over it to make sure I had everything right. When I was done correcting my work I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading."
" I don’t really know if it is or not. Patience is when your quite, you can wait for things. Patience is self respecting, kind fair and not self seeking. Patience is respect not disrespect, patience has no evil, paticence does not boast. It helps to wait for things"

"I awoke at the sound of the alarm clock on a sort @PERSON1. It was @NUM1 my mom was on time prepare ???. Today was the day that the x-box @NUM2 came out and I wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running arch I could get it. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just followed my mom and never showed any ginks of being impatient. I couldn’t do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. It was already dark when we finally went to best buy to buy the x-box @NUM2. We went and got it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day."
"One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn’t see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn’t get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie"
"There goes another @NUM1 minutes wasted! I knew I should of got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @CAPS1 for food? Three days ago, l though that l should stop at my locker before going to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh graders urging to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, @CAPS6 the food was at! I reached out and - wait @CAPS6's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The aroma of pizza enticed my sense and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angerly paced, ""@CAPS6 is the food?"" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. At least l had some food! I plopped down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience ."" l got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating but sometime you @MONTH1 get rewarded!"
"A time were I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I got my broken foot. It was really boring everybody got to go in front of us. Finally the nurse said “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” so I went in and then we had to wait for the doctor to come in and that took like a good twenty minutes. And all the doctor wanted to know is how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time, because first they have to put like five layers of cloth on it then they put like two layers of the cast thing on then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can be hard sometimes but everybody can have patients."
"One day not @CAPS1 very long ago, my brother @PERSON1, had homework troubles. And yes @CAPS2 is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I had said “on what.” @CAPS1 he said “@CAPS2 math homework its just too long and I can’t do it.” @CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper"
"Sixty nine days ago @CAPS1-three miners in chile got stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface. Now, they are safe and sound at home. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck they didn’t panick or blame each other they waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners had been told them they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Thankfully on @DATE1 all the miners come out safely. This all took patience in order to workout. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to resue all @CAPS1-three miners."
 A time I was patient was when my family and I went to west viragna. But we had to want in a long line just to get in a resturant . And we had a happy dinner. that a time when I was patient.
" My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient"

 My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors. It was a long day. I would see people come in and then go out. I see about @NUM1 people do that
 Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn’t listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesn’t have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect! In summary patience is one way element to life.

"This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I’m empty on the inside, i goess. There’s gore for a while. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He’s always there, in her old chair. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night. He’s useless now, but I’m patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @CAPS7 the park, doing odd jobs for some extra cash, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it’s not just @CAPS2 who I’m waiting on, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. One day in the park a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he’d seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn’t just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3 , who dis appeased three weeks after I met him. He’s gone hasn’t showed up since @CAPS7 night I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park. I’m patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I’m still waiting for a hello."
 Patience is hard. You must stay calm and be pieceful in patience that they almost forgot what they are whating for but I always @CAPS1 it now too.I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't what that long and it gives my tension just knowing whats going to happen.
"Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother is loyal to the “aliens”. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesn’t cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isn’t true he will defend you. He says, “its not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself."

Then I went in for @CAPS2. When I came back out I thought what can i do . Then I saw the ??? hill.So I got out the slasher went to the field @CAPS3 thrashing. I loaded the track to. Then when I got back to put the other tractor out and attached the header to do   I went out and worked ground, when  I got back I was thinking what am I  @CAPS4 to do know, when I hear same and pulling it was my grandpa. We get in the track to town."
"Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn’t care though because I was focused on one thing- my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while to the party started. I plaged some sweet video games. Played outside and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn’t believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave, when I got home I dashed to my clock like @CAPS2 in headlights @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I’m still alive, right? My friends don’t know me to have patience and I don’t either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again."
"This is a story about a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient is when I was at food store waiting for my food. I ordered my food and they took olday to give it to me . Other people was ??? in ???  there ??? they still did not give me mine, so I went outside and told my granddad that they were about to give me my food . I told him that because he kept asking me why they are taking so long. So we started talking and waiting patient for are food. My name is @CAPS3, I was born in @DATE1 , I was raised in the city of @LOCATION1 oit. I was patient because I did not get angry and I waited. So then they called my name and said my food was ready. Thats a story about a time when I was patient."
 That was when I was being patient.
 One time I was told by my big brother that we were going to go to micigman adventure so I was waiting till he would come home is and then my dad told me that I should get ready to go so like to back up my shorts and ??? ???  that so I did that then I just sat there for about ??? was then I called him and he said ??? ??? I
"There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1! It was a night more coming true. We got hungry. We really didn’t compliments. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were companing a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fum to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day. The end."
"Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 was early @DATE1, the leaves just beginning to change colors and flutter down above your head. My mother, sister, a friend of hers and mall piled into car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we come to a folk in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally after another half hour of walking we ended up at the exit. @CAPS2 turned out all right and my mother was always patient with us we complained and moaned."
 Patience is about waiting for some thing. Like we can say your new shoes will becoming in two weeks instead of paceing around worrying all the time. If your inpatient you would go look for some. You have to to herdteif it dont come the come the @DATE1 it supposed to. This one tim I had a @CAPS1 appointment at @TIME1 and my mom and I had to wait until five o'clock. And we never got mad just a little board. This one time a friend of mine was waiting for his dad didnt  come home until the @DATE1
"Paitience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone or for something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but momdid not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker.” I went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker. I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles."
"One time was the often best friend I had went to a ride it was so hot outside but the first ride we on was called the @CAPS1. But I didn’t really complain about except for my friend she kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large  feet were tired, but when we finally got there we stared rolling to know how ."
One time I had to be really patience. It was when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my family. It would have taken two or three days but we stoped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restronts on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way it felt like two weeks. My uncle @PERSON1 called us ever five minuts on the way. My uncle loves co-co weats. I mean I like them to but not that much. When we finly got down there my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dads car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back in to my legs.
" I think patience is about waiting. For example “you were very patience in line for cotton candy”, said the clown. You know something like that I know this a short story, I’m sorry."
" He was turning @NUM1 years old. They we came inside to relax and watch some television. We played with there dog after a while. Then a lot of people came over. We went outside for a third time played. We had to come inside and @CAPS4 up for dinner. We all ate turkey, baked potatoes, cheese potatoes, squeen, beans. Then they wanted us ??? project. It was a jon with a candle in it. We had to cover it in tisue paper and it uses lots of glue. I had to wait patiently I was the last one to domine. It actually turned out pretty good after all. Being patient con get you very far in life. So remember just be patient and you'll be okay. Being patien will guide you through your hole life"
""
" It was @DATE1. We were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was carling her hair in the bathroom. She said “You have wait”. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, if was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. I was last on the bowling list @CAPS3 I had to be patient for awile. It was finally my turn. I bowled and I waited. Bowled and water. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she’s @CAPS3 slow,” @CAPS3 I walked up there and shouted, “@CAPS4 up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should of be patient the whole day and maybe I would of participated in all the games."

"Patience is a very hard thing to capture. One time I had to try and @CAPS1 my patience was before a @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was driving there. It was @NUM1 and people were migrating to @PERSON1! It took us @NUM2 to go @NUM3! I was about ready to just run to the game! I could not wait any longer to go to this game!”@CAPS1 your patience!”my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. It was fun walking up with all the @LOCATION1 state fans, and tailgaters. Again i had to question myself I could be patient enough one by one people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience . It was great to finally be in there , having overcome my rushed feeling and letting  patience take over me."
 I was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store. I started to get real; mad because I thought the store person that was ringing up the stuff tryed to go slow so I couldn’t use it. The only reason why I didn’t complain was because most of the stuff and the bascket was mine
" Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of @PERSON1 right next to famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me I’m not that patient. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to launch of our patience. And thats my story being patient."
 One time I had to be very pationt. Every hour I would go look outside to see if she was there. Eventually she did and I was very happy. Focus on something else @NUM2. @NUM3 too someones house for a while. @NUM4. Or even tack a nap @CAPS1 are examples of staying patient.
 There was some music but that didn’t really amuse us. But I had never been on the raptor before and I was really thrilled to go on it. Then finally ten more minutes wait till I got to go on the raptor it was the best ride ever
"I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad before, @DATE1. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. Some other guys shot one they all run way. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in we were all there from @TIME1 until @NUM1. I was patient the whole time."
"One day during the @DATE1 my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was no where in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear down every thing. I stopped I felt my back pocket and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Any way, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stuned to see who it was. It was my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hasitated to say yes. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. I got out the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We whent on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and wating and waiting. Finally! Yes we can go. I couldn't wait any longer. I had no choice but to wait."
 The @CAPS1 out in @DATE1. One day when my aunt @PERSON1 was watching me and all of a sudden all the lights went out.
"One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 releived! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it now I am feeling better and back in school!"
 But I was still not calming down then the very first person left and then was starting to calm down and just wait for the next person to go
 I was patient when I was waiting for a guy to ask me out::) and I’m still dating him this day. His name is @PERSON1 and yes he goes in my school when he asked me out I didn’t now what to say cause he took to long and I still did not like another guy but him. When someone patient that don’t rush threw they wait for something or someone like I did. When I was patient I didn’t ask him @NUM1 times I waited until he asked me out cause if someone doesn’t like they might turn you down and hurt you.
I chose write a story about a time when I was patient. What I had to was walk in the woods and sit down once you sit down you cant move. So I was sitting very still for @NUM1 minutes and finally I seen a squirl. So I took my shotgun and shot her in the chest. I was patient so I got a squirl. So that’s my story on patients.
 Well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. Well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text. I knew that meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page. I almost flipped out but I held it back. I think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right. I’m very glad I have a good amount of patience.
The time I waited for party to happen. It was @DATE2 until I’ve been invited to a party at zapzone. He told me the party was on @DATE1. But it was a party so I didn’t have @NUM2 weeks later I went school shopping for ten minutes
"When I have patient is when I go out to eat. So no one can speat in, my food. And we all was dress alike for my birthday. So I ask my daddyto tell them that my birthday is to day. And I wanted a piece of cake now. So he want to tell what I said and they ??? give us a minute. So I waited and waited. And finly said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place brun down. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. So they finly bring my cake. And they sang happy birthday to me. And I was happy after that in tell I found out they speat in my food and ate itto. I had found out because before I lifte I heard some people talking about how they speat in my food. Then I said wait did you in the fries they said yea. They said why I because I the fries is neasty. But I don`t  do that because I scared somebody would do it again."
" “I can’t believe that the airport had an opening earlier in the day and called us? Exclaimed my @CAPS4. “@CAPS1 I can’t either. I mean out of all- Were here! Man that was quick. “@CAPS6 you called saying there was empty seats and invited us to exchange @CAPS2.” @CAPS8 again another chessy smile “@CAPS6 you can have your orginal @CAPS2 back if you like,” @NUM2 @LOCATION2. @NUM2! What am I going to do for seven hours! First my brother and I had races up and down the escelators. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere. By @NUM4 I knew the place inside out. Soon it time to leave suddenly the speaker came on @CAPS10 @NUM5 to @LOCATION2 has been deylayed by an hour and a half” @NUM6 now really? Luckly my @CAPS4 took me to an extotic restraunt. Beautiful restraunt soon it was time to leave. Please don’t get delayed again?! It wasn’t. I felt happy that we finally left @CAPS8 sad. I learned a great lesson about patience! It’s not hard @CAPS6 not impossible."

"Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn’t have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it’s most likely not gonna speed up. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. I think that patience is very good to have."
A time when I was patient is when it was winter time and my cousin and I really wanted to go outside. She wasn’t being patient. That is a time when I was patient
A time I was patient was when my sister got her lisense. When we got thare she pulled a ticket out of a michenie then it said # @NUM1 the screen said @NUM2. We stayed thare for @NUM4 hours strait I hope it dos not take that long for my lisence

 Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load.
"It was a light breezey morning. It was @NUM1 @CAPS1, my parents were just finishing the packing for @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. We're going to A @LOCATION1 because my sister has a laccrose  ternament in @LOCATION2. That even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a tv in are van. I ran back in the house and unpluged my @ORGANIZATION1 gamecabe.  I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on are trip. The we start off. For the first coaple hours we just liscened to the radio. Then came the affect of my brother and sister owe never get going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @NUM2 hours this out and we were in @LOCATION1. @NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the???movie for the last hour. The hour went be like a flash. Finally done that is a time I was sort of patient."
Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had missed about an inning of the game already. It was so crowded. My mom probably could’ve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad.
 It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winters day and it was my time to go to school and I couldn'@CAPS1 wait till the school day was over because it was the day when we got @ORGANIZATION1. When school end my mom came to pick up my sister and I up from school to go home and wait patiently at home my dad and @ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and my two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @CAPS1.V just listening for the jerouge door to open. And the we herd it open and we all were jumping up and down running and screeming outside and there she was @ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on the winters day waiting patiently for the best dog in the world
"A A time when I was patience is when our family goes to @CAPS1 point. My family and I go to @CAPS1 point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again.I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines."
"Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky @DATE1 day and cedar point was packed. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! “@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again” I pleaded. “@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!” @CAPS1 quickly replied. “@CAPS5! I never get what I want do I!” “You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!” “well I don’t wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might!” by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didn’t get front cart the wait wasn’t even that bad"
"Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacher’s help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient"
"My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight eclips, me and my mom were heading to the movie theature and I wouldent stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 was no where to park. Me and my mom were waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and were steping into the building and we rushed to get the tiketts and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to get past the time. It actually helped the securety said stand up time for trivia. They asked a bunch of question about the last movie “@CAPS2 @CAPS3” I raised my hand and I answered the question right I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. After the movie was done me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got @CAPS1. This was the story when I used patience."
"” I looked at the clock. Five thirty. “you’ll have to wait. “@CAPS3 doesn’t come on till eight.” “@CAPS1 I wanna watch @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 z @ORGANIZATION1 . he ???Not again. I thought. Do we have to go through this every day. Why don’t I still have ???. I walked slowly to my room, knowing I would have to keep ??? @CAPS2. ??? until eight oclock “kumehnn“@CAPS2 quiet.” I was starting to mad. “@CAPS3 doesn’t come on until eight okay.”"
" I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if im waiting for school to start. Then also the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. ?? when they do call I rush right to the phone and answer it right away. I will even sit there and stare at the phone waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back til bed time so I will never have to clean my room."
My cousin was patient when we were waiting in line for the top l will @CAPS1 at (cedar point. The line almost took @NUM1 hours.I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet running around etc. I just couldn’t stanistrn. After @NUM1 hours we finally got into the ride. After the ride I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said for every word one of us said we have a minute of homework when we come back to @LOCATION1. Thats how I learned my lesson to be patient
"Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don’t. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. That is exactly @CAPS2 happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn’t stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over “stiff upper lip.” I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came agian, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn’t work tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. “I want to go home” I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and relized it was my voice and said “@CAPS2” all grouchy. I had sniffled and said “I want to come home, I miss you.” and sniffled more. “Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready.” @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5, I said bye once more and went out into the cold, wind and hopped in @LOCATION1’s car. “@CAPS4 didn’t you want to stay?” @PERSON5 asked calmly. “I don’t know.” And it wasn’t brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks"
"Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That on main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dogs name is @CAPS1 mae she is three years old and is full blooded pitbull.??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check up. The @CAPS6 said she was all good, then pulled my mom to the side. My heart was pumping faster than ever because usually when they pull the parents to the side I t means something bad. My mom screamed and rejoiced. We went and got dixixe and then we took her to the bark play and that night she got her very own steak at supper. The next few months were going by faster than ever. Well at least it seemed like it. Now @CAPS1 was get bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be six months atleast until she has the puppies it`s aready been five and half, mom said, that she has milk now’ I told my sister, @DATE1 . “I wouldn`t doubt it,’ said @DATE1 then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day while I was getting ready for school my mom said hey sweetheart I called the @CAPS6 and he said that he wouldn`t be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today” then I said oh cool but let`s not rush @CAPS1 she`s going through a lot right now. The bus ride usually takes like an hour to school but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by fast. Before I knew it I was home, I walked in the front door and my mom said “oh your just in time honey @CAPS3 having her babies” we both ran into the garage faster than ever @CAPS1 was laying on a blanket, I jotted to her and she licked my hand. I told her everything is going to be alright.” I went inside to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I come back out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the other two after them. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. The mom @CAPS1 mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies, cutie, bootsier. Tinker, bella, harmony and melony. I love my dogs!"
"I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. Am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. She even sad  so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient."
 It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for ???. Five minutes past and they still weren’t don so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still weren’t done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done ??? was only two minutes. ??? well I guess I give it another try and if I still don’t get I’ll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out it just wasn’t making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her
"Well, one day I saw a commercial on the awesome xbox @NUM1. The commercial said it would be out in @NUM2 weeks. It said @NUM4, “I said,” @CAPS1 only been @NUM5 minutes. My dad said that we were going shopping to get my x-box"
"This is my story about patience. I go to the doctors every @NUM1 months. When the doctor ask my brothers questions when he says then I am already coming up with my answer and then its my turn, but before my turn @NUM4 sce the doctor I was ireally patient. Then it took the doctor @NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with. When we do to the doctor or dentist we and really patient but it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do."
"I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely with and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait unit I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm no where near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long role of stall, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then run to her friends after, a drink of water, and doesn't have to patient anymore for a while"
" Or like when you kep on rasing your hand the techer kep on saying do your work and you does l it a gen she will say, if you do that agen you will go to the chouse room. Thats when a teacher loses her patience."
"I am writing about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when it wast the first week of football. We went town to subway before the game and got a cub. I was the first one in line but then I was folowed by other people olny one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally I was up next I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana, pepper, cucumbers and great frech spinach.   It rearned something in that line being patient realy pays off and by the time in at back. It had over been @NUM1 minutes"
"Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4’t have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but here’s a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like there’s no tomorrow. To bad I couldn’t play outside. I was to busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It could give me bragging rights I figure I need some hope and patience..” @CAPS1” ,my brother yelled all happy and in my face. “@CAPS4’t get to happy , there’s still plenty of time left.” I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I ‘d loose, but taking deep brother in and out, I was  very patient. The clock winding down. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back I for the steepless made an awsorde pass and @CAPS1 I screamed dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, “who is the loser now, huh?” wow all it took was patient, and hope” I told myself. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little  competive but if you  just wait and tolerate what’s happening around you, you’ll end up getting rewarded!."
"Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experience difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do @CAPS11 I did it before. Hello, @CAPS13 me mame, I mean man, can you walk any shower? “@CAPS4, I can if you want me to.” A nice man said in a kind friendly voice to @CAPS5. I m cut you just because of your stupuidity .” @CAPS5 said, trying to act all tough. @CAPS5 was only a year older than me (@NUM1) and he thinks he’s all big and can di anything he wants. “@CAPS8, little man you can’t cut me, I was waiting in line forever. “ well , too bad .” while @CAPS3 brother was  making eniesnes, was waiting patiently in line even though the line wasn’t really moving, inside I wanted to out every one @CAPS11 not like some people I have patients and can wait. After @CAPS3 brother cut that man and didn’t get punished he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very very mad at @CAPS5 @CAPS11 not one did anything besides say,” @CAPS8 don’t cut me.” @CAPS11 that didn’t’ really help. Intill @CAPS5 cutted the @CAPS15 person. That person was a young pretty body with beautiful blue eyes and has such pretty blond hair, her name was @PERSON1  “@CAPS13 me police man, this  young , little boy just cutter we and every one else. While I was waiting there patiently, @CAPS5 got kicked out of the whole park’ @CAPS15 in line please, “  “ @CAPS1 that’s me ….Were “was the best roller coaster I had ever been on. Being patient is hard @CAPS11 can be rewarding. I also learned to be patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerant. Now, @CAPS16 know you get the best when your patient. And the worst when your not."
" If you do not possess patience no one will want to be your friend. You have to have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. In order to succeed in life in general you must have patience. Whether is waiting for the bus or waiting for a response from a job interview, it’ll always matter. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have"
 Every weaken my brother play in a play football league and it can bewaring.
"Frezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. Her dirty blond hair whips her face, and @CAPS7 hunches her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles side ways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tooth time. I was cold, bord, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. Which was @CAPS4 easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I had, but I still think I should take him. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say joining them into my pockets. A voice booms out of the specker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Lets get moveing!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.”"
"A time I was patient was when I had to baby sit little cousin. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him"
"There haven’t been many times were I was patient but I’m going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 mede me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn’t aloud to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar paint. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didn’t care because it was my friend’s and my favorite ride, it wasn’t so bad because it’s all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but I’ve had to wait patiently even longer than that!"
" For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it."
"ON @DATE2 I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldn’t get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasn’t doing a lot for @CAPS1, I told her I’m fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2 but she didn’t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us.  But my daddy would always say I know if he had it he would give to @CAPS1. Then when @DATE1 came everything was ok into @DATE1 my grandma passed away. Then that was a time I didn’t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. So my mom and them all tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she’s in a better place with some of her love ones. But into this day I can’t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 forgotten"

 In this narrative essay I will write about @NUM1 different times when I was out had to be patient. Such on the waiting to get out of school on a holiday. And when I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so I could get my game. One day  I was very anxious to get out of school on a firday. And to make it I bad the clack was drare and I had  a planned schedule of my think day. I was about to get a call home but the @CAPS1. Another time I had to be understanding about was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See what had happened was I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it. And that was the time I had to be patient.
"A  time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister , my niece, and I were going to the barber shop at @NUM1. I was getting my hair cut by a official barbor. I waited all the way to @NUM2 to get my hair cut"
 ?? with a ?? tim ??? samh is and infront today she is ??? doing the ??. ?? she ???(@CAPS1
 A time when I was patient was when @CAPS1 came. And I was getting hungry so I went inside and asked when is dinner @CAPS2? And @CAPS3 and hour
" Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. @ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and to watch all for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked with. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that that he had kidnapped: @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient"
"Who likes being patient it’s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn’t wait to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it just be patient and it will pay off."
A time that I showed patience is when my sister broke my futon
"One day when I was walking put side I found a snake on a rock. He said” hold on I need to beat the leavie “ but the snake was getting eratatid sot said,” now garrid its leaving finally after ten minutes he came out of the house and stared at what was in my hand."
"I’m going to tell you a time when I was patient. a time I was patient was when I had to save up my money to get the new game halo reach. I had to pre order it with my money, so I did a bunch of work so I cut the lawn at my house then I cut other peoples lawn for two dollars so I did that for about two months at the end. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre ordered and they told me I had to wait for three weeks so I did just that. I waited and bought some other stuff with the left over money and the game finaly came in the mail."
"Have you ever had enough patients to deal with @NUM1 screaming  kids. I,can proudly say that i can. It all started when my uncle steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed alot of help so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to help them. The only problem was there where @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 her. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But,it didnt take long  for everybody to get uncomfortable. Everybody starts to feel smocshed in and get really hot. I thank god that there was atleast a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn’@CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @NUM1 hours I’d had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion was making me dizzy. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally after about @NUM8 hours we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patients I had"
 You need patience  at an amusment park to wait in all the lines. Patience is not complaining about being board on a long car ride
 I don’t have a time when I’m patience so today I going to write about how impatience I am. I was a hot day and I was ready to go my cool and big house and relax and chillout. You all know how old people are they walk slow and talk to much. If you already notice. @NUM1 of those people where in front of me. He’s taking all the day taking out his wallet and talking to much
 I was buying  @CAPS2  but  I can’t buy  any more  because   @CAPS1 is  coming up  that  why I half to be  patient because it will seen longer  if  I keen getting excited.    Every day  is  patient sometimes I can’t wait to  get  out  of  school so  I can  play. I’m always trying to be patient because it’s one holiday after another each one gets more exiting.  How I’m patient is I act like nopthing  exciting  is even comimg up.

"Today was the final day of tryouts. The deciding day .Tryouts we over I patiently waited for the @CAPS2 to hand out the envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I didn’t know if could handle this. “@CAPS1 until you’ve left the building to open your envelope,” @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said. “@CAPS3’s only fair .If everyone opens them in here then people who don’t make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didn’t make @CAPS3 feel even more bummed and left out .Be patient and @CAPS1 until you leave the building.I came up and grabbed my envelope .She dismissed us .some girls opened their envelopes right away .But, they didn’t make @CAPS3 .karma .I waited until I got outside. I could barely @CAPS1 .I needed to know but I had to @CAPS1 .Patience isn’t such a lovely thing always. I made the team! I was so excited and I was glad I had the patience to @CAPS1 and be surprised."
"One day my brother, my mom and me were going to the doctor’s because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctor’s office’s and sat in the waiting area. They called my mom and brother. My mom told it will only take two minutes. It took her two hours to come back. So while I was patient I texted my aunt and friends. I actually brought my @CAPS1 with me. So I waited and waited. I was so bored I went outside for some fresh air. Then I got tired I just sat there. Finally they came out. Guess what my mom said “how are you sweety”, then my mum told me my brother was sick. I was so patient that we got to eat at @ORGANIZATION1. after the ??? I was patient at the clinic so then we spent @NUM1 minutes. I was ??? ???

One day a kid was going to school @CAPS4 was going to turn in a paper for math @CAPS2 @CAPS4 did. During @CAPS1 class @CAPS4 was doing a chapter sketch. His teacher called him over. @CAPS4 said “no” teacher asked “why” the kid said “because I have been going to a basketball tournament.” teacher said “you have tell tomorrow.” @CAPS2 the next day the kid is at @CAPS1 class @CAPS4 said “I’m @CAPS2 sorry I don’t have my paper.” teacher said “okay tomorrow

" One day it was sunny with a cool breeze. A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they packed up there camping gear and headed farther into the woods it was around dusk when they reached were they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire, @LOCATION1 started gathering firewood and tried to start the fire how there mom and dad had taught them. A.J. didn’t care he got the acorns and started cookin. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning he found @LOCATION1 cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient."
 One day I was being really patient. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or you’ll go to your room.
Patience is about whaiting and having what for staff you want like if I wont anything Patience is that you have to what before you get it
 Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality.
"It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I where going up the street to the carnival they were having. When we got there it was ranning and one of the rides were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn’t go on it. It was called the freax out. There were lights flikering and loud music. We were in the line for it but I got out. @CAPS4 said “why did you get of line?” “I am scaryed.” “ I want to go on it though.” “@CAPS1 you wait till later?” I said. We waited for a hour. That’s when @CAPS4 said “I @CAPS1 wait.” @CAPS4 was nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side I love that ride now"
 One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & I taught him how to pitch. But this didn’t stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said “no!” @CAPS2 time went on @PERSON1 started to get better and better.
 Pg @NUM1: @CAPS1 her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were @NUM2 of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! So we couldnt even more our arms I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. We finally made it to our destination key wrap. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tryed my hardest to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I didnt are and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @NUM4°@CAPS3 degrees. When I thought about how long it was to get here I didnt even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But how I know I have the patients to go home!
"Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience difficult to come by, along with many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait even when it’s the night the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn’t back yet I didn’t know. All I knew was going to happen that night that was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearabl heat getting to me because when the door slamed shut @CAPS10 orgued that @CAPS4’d only been gone for five fast muinets. I didn’t belive her, but we climed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every, stoplight. It was like the light were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with @CAPS3 way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stoped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “@CAPS3!” I shouted, “I don’t have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. Flop” I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night.  “@NUM1 minets till midnight” @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explaind to me “That’s impossible” I told her.” @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minuets wasn’t that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffe coming from inside and listend to the num of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. “@CAPS5 the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen” how is it going to end” @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. “@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad” @CAPS10 asked. “I guess not” I answerd sheepishly. “Being patient payed off’ @CAPS10 lectured. I didn’t reply I was already reading a mile minuet. I learnd being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patient is undersanding and @CAPS9 that I’m a little better at being patient things will be a lot better."
"One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called modern, if you don’t know what that is I’ll tell you. Well modern is a place I love it. I went there with my mom I told her she doesn’t have to stay but she insisted she stayed. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met."
" @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited for his turn. He learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor"
" If you have ever played a contact sport you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When you sprang your ankle it hurts a lot. Once you get in the nurse asked you a few questions then you have to wait even more now @CAPS1! But atleast you eventually find out whats wrong, after the doctors came in they had to take x-rays witch took a while to develop. But at the end of the @DATE1 he let my play! I guess thats what I got for waiting patiatley all game."
V and she went to see if her made was done she was not done and @PERSON1 was unpatient and got really mad and pounded on the door and said you better hang up or or and then she saw someone out of the corner of her eye and she realized that she had left the light on in the bathroom and nobody was in there her made was now right behind  her in the hell she was emmbarassed and humiliated so she ran to her room and cried and that is the story of the time the princess was unpatient!
"Here I was on @CAPS1 third day of volley ball tryouts. I was sure I was going to be on the A team. I tossed the ball up and let @CAPS3 drop back down. The toss was no good. I threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard I could. “@CAPS1 last serve” I thought, “please be over.” I watched as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, I seemed as if gravity suddenly took affect. The ball droped down at hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. I felt cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope, I breathed in and out slowly. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand in the envelope. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in ecxitement. Finally I was got to find out weather I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. @CAPS3 felt as if the world depended on @CAPS3.” @CAPS3 the sight of those words I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I desided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn’t. After all this time I finally knew. @CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tryed something and had to wait to know if I succseded or not. I wouldn’t of had @CAPS3 any other way."
"Patience is one of the worlds most important lifeskills. Having my best friend live across the street is great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesn’t get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you"
"Everyone has to have patience. Everone has patience it depend if its a long patience or a short patience. When you get in to @NUM2-all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well behaved. Like my dad he is a lawyer he deals with adults his patience is not close to what my mom is. My mom still deals with adults but she grew up with four brothers but she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. When ever I say come pick me up mat seven o’clock, he will be there by seven o’clock. Now my mom comes and picks up and I say seven o’clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience.”"
 If I had the money I would have got something for @NUM1-point buck
 Once when me my dad were supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait until my dad and he said he was getting of work at @NUM1 oclock and that’s the time the races starts. It takes a hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet me drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient playing in my room with all my toys. I was worried that I wasn’t going to go at all. @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something tapping me I opend my eyes and saw my dad he said get up were going to the races. We got there and we found out we had the wrong time we were an hour early. And that weekend they were having a three hundred lap race. It was the end of the race seson of the year. First they did the three hundred lap race. After that they did the school bus derby race. I was so happy you be there and to se the school buses race. A little kid said “no w how am I going to get to school there crashing all the school buses.” @CAPS1 the race were finished I than ked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home and I went to @CAPS2
"On a super hot summers day, me, my mother and @CAPS1 all went to best western. The reason is that we don’t have air conditioning and we were melting like ice cream. But, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, but I cooled down and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran then jumped right in! It took like a half hour, even if it wasn’t worth it, it was still fun"
 Once I was at an airport in @LOCATION1. We were coming home from @LOCATION2. There were only two people working for @LOCATION3 citizens. There was a lot of waiting and a lot whining but we finally made it through. Of course they all thanked us for our patience and once the passport were stamped we were on our way to the next flight.
 When I was at cedar point I had a lot of patience. I went to cedar with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1 or @NUM1 @DATE1’s ago. It was my first time and this was like @PERSON1’s @NUM2 time. We went on so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn’t very patient but after a while I had patience and my friend didn’t. My friend wanted to go on the dragter but I didn’t. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of riding amazing rides. The lines got longer. I was funny cause it’s the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient. But I don’t know if that will happen.
"Patience is having control over yourself write you wait. @CAPS1 means to have composure over yourself. But patience is sometimes. Like when you are waiting on a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza @CAPS1 takes about @NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, an @CAPS1 is ,is something someone mode up. Not that people have patience"
My mom and I were were on are way to are house from sonco
"I’m going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. This time was good as any. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, to…uh, I think it’s to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I don’t know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! It’s very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I can’t help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. We’re not aloud to get up, so we’re stuck “sniff”, “sniff”, snot”-ing  all hour long. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, that’s better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably don’t have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying this… writing about patience, but now, I’m done. (yes!)"
"One time I was patient. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun"
"“Patience is a virtue. “patience is virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysist my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. She’s an easy one to babysit. Not that I don’t love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kid to ba bysit. We started off pretty good that morning. we had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please.” @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didn’t want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can’t” “well why can’t you?” “@CAPS1 I don’t want to.” I was started to lose my temper when I realized the saying “patcience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patient must feel like. “@PERSON4 I’ll bet you can’t go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “@CAPS2 I can!” “@CAPS3, prove it.” @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if your patcient, and crafty might just come to you."
"I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when she couldn’t find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat was on the on phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. That’s  the time of when I know  someone was patient."

" I had patience in that store because I waited in the labb of the hospital, and waited for the doctor to tell us what happened and when they took the @CAPS1-@CAPS5 and lastly when they said the need to pull the plug on him"

"Book @CAPS1 ‘And the characters lived happily ever after……..for now!’ @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, very sad that no more pages we’re left. This was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @LOCATION1 made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @LOCATION1 scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. She @CAPS11 the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. @LOCATION1 went to the library @CAPS11 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 about the book. The results we’re very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, @CAPS6 when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “@CAPS3’s wrong!” @CAPS11 her mom. My name is @NUM1 on the list, @CAPS6 @CAPS12 could be ages until those other people finish.” “@CAPS4, I think you have to learn some patience” said mom. “Patience? @CAPS3’s that?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don’t complain about @CAPS12. Take you, for example, your being very impatient.” “@CAPS6 I’m waiting” said @CAPS7 “@CAPS8, @CAPS6 you are complaning a whole lot.” The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. Later on. @LOCATION1 was called to the office. “@CAPS9” said @PERSON2. “@CAPS3’s this?” @CAPS11 @LOCATION1 “@CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @CAPS12’s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.” “@CAPS13 you” said @LOCATION1. She couldn’t belive @CAPS12! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait."
" In the old testament long ago there was a man named @PERSON1@NUM1 was very rich, very happy and was loyal to god.When @PERSON1 was having a bad yet the next day one of his ??? in the said “A great fire has ??? and says , “@CAPS1 your livestock was at nicked by wolves wear the only one s left ,the another I didn’t ian ihand side @CAPS1 your livestock was at naked is wolves we arc the only one left the another I didn’t ran I hand said towel a have stolen @CAPS1 your cold then the???  servant??? in and self the roof had ??? in the hall @CAPS1 your  family has been killed’’!

 Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.
 Is when I want something really bad. Like a phone or to get on the computer or something
"Last year t went to @LOCATION1 city with @CAPS1 mom, @CAPS1 step-dad, @NUM1 of   @CAPS1 brothers, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and, @CAPS1 her @NUM2 kids @PERSON1 and sack. The first place we went was he state of liberty. We got in the line for the ferry that toves you to the island where the statue of liberty is. The line was hug antic. I thought, ""@CAPS4 great"" because it was neatly @DATE1 outside and we were going to the waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half hour I noticed that the live goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty. It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. @CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of way self for not complaining. Apparently @CAPS1 mom was to because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me a side and thanked we for being so patient"
 A story of being patient A kid wakes up. He goes upstairs to get a drink. He goes back down and watches cartoons. He becomes very excited. The @CAPS2 are playing @CAPS1. His dad comes downstairs and tells him to get ready for the game.  They drive about @NUM1 miles to the @CAPS2 stadium. They get there find their seats. The game starts. The @CAPS2 kickoff. The @CAPS2 stop them and by the end of the first half the @CAPS2 are down. ??? the score was @DATE1 to @NUM2. You can already see people leaving. Then comes the @DATE1. Now at the end of the @NUM3. the @CAPS2 are down??? More and more people leave. The @CAPS2 are coming back. Now down by @NUM4 the @CAPS2 get another touch?? They are only down by three. @NUM5 seconds??? to give @PERSON1 culler throws a ??? pass to @LOCATION1 ??she. the crowd goes wild. We were patient enough to stay till the end of the game.
"Two summers ago I went to @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1. We had to drive for @NUM1 hours straight. I mostly just sat in the back seat and listened to my @NUM2 player. @CAPS1 was a very boring car ride. We were half way there so we stopped at a dunkin donuts, @CAPS1 was early in the @TIME1, my sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate. Then we got to a whole bunch of little booths were you have to show your passport to got in. And finally we were in @LOCATION2. We stayed there for @NUM3 or @NUM4 nights. Then we were on the rode again for @NUM5 hours. When we got there, all the patience paid off. And that’s a time  when I was patient"
 Me my brother and my sisters told my mom “can @CAPS4 play the @CAPS1 and the labtop.” @CAPS3 the @CAPS4 played it. Each person had one and a half hour to play on both things .I let my brother and sister s play first because I’m the oldder one and I have to wait ptiencetly until it was my town.  And that’s what I say I do as being patience at home and the respect my brother and sisters.
" After about an hour of waiting my cousin and; started to play video games to entertain ourselves @CAPS1 the time went faster my grandma had  probably worked for @NUM1 hours @CAPS1 at three- pm I decided to watch a movie I had been patient for the whole movie, at the middle of the movie my grandma got home @CAPS1 we all waited patiently till she was ready to  the beach.This was a time when I had been patient."
 The word patience means a lot of things. It also talks a lot ??? It takes time and effort. Other people they don’t complain they an it. A lot of teenagers have no patience. As you get older you develop patience some adults don’t have patience it depends on if you work at it. It also depends on whether the person has gone through in life
" When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits atleast two hours untill it’s over. Every morning she waits on me  to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something  at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn’t rush us unless were late. And she always hugs us before we leave."
"We all don`t like waiting like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. @DATE1 @DATE1 @DATE1 when I went to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. While still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for you flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have. When I went to @LOCATION1 @DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don’t like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it`s something we have to do."
"One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said “@CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @CAPS2 or later?” I chose @CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. It was around @NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was getting mad. This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @LOCATION1 parking lot. When we got into the store that’s when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said “@CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients?” “I’ll try”. I said. After we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ORGANIZATION1, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @ORGANIZATION1 and then realized that line was the @ORGANIZATION1 line. We got in the lot and I knew for sure that I was going to have more patients. So we waited and the line went really fast. We got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said “@CAPS4 you for your patients”. Then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large frie. My mom turn to me and said “Do you see what happens if you be patient?” I said yeah and patients is a good thing to have."
 My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept haveiry mastakes with it like they spelled her last name wrong so it had to be called back and retiped everytime they retipped it they would make a mastakes five times in a row and it takes a long time to prosses and we needed to pay our pills so we wouldn’t get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes. and clothes
 Patience every knows what it is and how we all can stay focus is like if were waiting at a unemployed line we wait cause patient keeps us from getting angry but if were waiting for a long time that’s a better chance of getting angry. When you patience you don’t have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldn’t complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.
The first time I ever was patient before is when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get @DATE1 film out of my camera my mom always promises me to get the film but sense her money was use on ??? She told me to wait @DATE1 @DATE1. She said no because she used her money??? school supples. I was happened to wait another @DATE1 @DATE1 so @DATE1 @DATE1 came again. Yes but she had to pay my dad back on helping her and after that she said after school I??? bringing my film out to buy
Do you have patients? I have very? Patient.I???will for anything for long
"There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said “@CAPS1 not tonight,” because it was a school night.”"
 My story in own way about being patience is when there is like @NUM1 people in front of a line a ceter point. You have to be patient in the lines because other were before you so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that you don’t want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat you have wait your turn in line so you don’t get kick out of the rides you have to wait your turn so you don’t get the secrety on you
"“@CAPS1 on!”I said.

 I was so excited. When we arrived I rushed out the car. We were gonna go on the @CAPS2 dragon there was such a long line. I was so excited to try this ride the family finaly moved up bup bup finally!!! We were next. The roller coaster was about a couple minutes long it was worth the wait.
"One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was at the locked @CAPS1 creem store frasty’s The line was huge. There had to @CAPS2 over @NUM1 people there and I was in the @CAPS3 of the line siting there waiting.  Thinking what I am going to get. One by one @CAPS4 took the orders. Until one short old lady hadn’t decided what she was going to get yet I sat and waited as she blaberd on ashing the prices if it was suger free, what toppings it had on it, @CAPS5, @CAPS5, @CAPS5. Finaly she orderd. I am at the front of the line and all of a sudden a group of people come up. I guess @CAPS4 were “holding  there  place in  line”. There had to @CAPS2 @NUM2 of them yelling at the person @CAPS8 the glass dire a roches ship going off. Finaly the order was done and I was up @CAPS9 @CAPS10 I could talk this sweet old lady asked “can I cut in front of you deer?” I had to say yes it wouldn’t @CAPS2 nice if I did’t."
"My brother matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long.   We always have to have patience with matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and @PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and other things as well. That took up atleast a couple of minutes. The lost couple of minutes we watched the football game that was going on. During those  couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking I did not hear matt have one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed matt’s girlfriend two dollars."
 You got try to be patient with homework. Because I was having trouble. But then my dad said he was going to help me @CAPS1 he told me to be patient. And stayed patient as l long as I could then he finely helped me. I usaly get unpatient when it comes to homework or something like that. You @CAPS2 need to try your hardest to be patient.
Everyone has been patient at one time of their. That we both needed a computer to finish. I let my brother go first. Being that there is one computer in the house I have to wait. After hours I checked to see if my brother was close to being done. He finished the next day. In had no problem with it because I had lots of time to type my paper. This is the time I was patient.
 I was also waiting for to get my own snowmoble licens so I can ride my own snowmible on the troils. Know  matter what you are always be patient
 This one time my brother and I were coming back from @LOCATION1. Everything was fine until the car broke down on the free way. So we called our parents to come get us. Well when they got there they forgot the cabols. So @NUM1 hours went by hear they come.
"Usually I have very little patience (and yes I do know that patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospitle room with any dad to spend time with my mom, @CAPS1 was very boring, but somehow I managed to go the whole day (up to where my dad finally let me watch @CAPS2. in the room) without being baerd to tears."
 I am always patient. But  do you know when and were I am really patient? It is when I am getting my hair cut.
 One day my dad and I had a doctor’s appointment at @NUM1 pm so we went there on time. Then my dad and I sat there for a while. We thought it would take a few more minutes. So we waited for @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went and asked other doctors how long is it going to take. The doctors said abott @NUM2 more minutes so we waited for @NUM2 more minutes. The doctor  still didn’t come out. We waited for @NUM5 minutes. They said few more minutes we waited for @NUM2 more minutes there the doctor called us. So the doctor was @NUM7 minutes late. When we went in the room the doctor said sorry! because he was late. That’s how me and my dad were patient
"A time when I was patient was when my dad and I went to leslie, to go hunting we wake up @TIME1 @TIME3 and get there @TIME1 @TIME4."
 When I was waiting I was sitting on the ground being really board. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn’t know. Finally the doctor called my name.
"Patience is something you need to get through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people do not have much of it, but others do. Like my brother, @CAPS4 has some but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; @NUM1 girls, @NUM2 boys. I am not going to lie, but I am @CAPS1 annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @CAPS1 obnoxious . But this one time, I don’t know what got into him. We were sitting @CAPS2 home one time, and my big bottle was being @CAPS1 patient, when we amay him, @CAPS4 would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother and I kept fighting and missing around with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even smack him in the am. Yet, @CAPS4 would just sit there like is nothing wrong. @CAPS4 would usually beat my siting and I if we would usually fight, and then fit it, but this time @CAPS4 didn’t care @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I was serious starting to get worried because that wasn’t like him. But I think @CAPS2 this point, I cut the thread of calling him nice. Before I knew it ,I was  on the floor crying. Oh, did I mention I ‘m daddy’s little girl? I think you could’ve figure out that my brother was  the one that got in trouble @CAPS4 had so much patience  by being tolerant during @CAPS3 those  things, well , @CAPS2 the and, @CAPS4 got cracked by my dad, and so did my fingers. @CAPS2 least I never got in trouble. That’s when daddy’s little girl comes in handy!"
 When im patient is mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be patient to wait for deer. They don't always come sometimes it could just be a fawn. Other  times it can be does. put when you see a buck ???is everything you first have to wait for it to come in close enough for a shot. When it does you have to wait to bring up your gun. If you get it you be patient and wait for it to die. If you cdnt find it right away dont give up. That is when I was patient.
"What is patient? Being patient means to wait for something that @MONTH1 take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is your waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. When you understand that moneys fight and you don't start by you moms side begging for the toy everyday your being patient. If you are doing that then you're not being patient and your mom going to say ""stop your being patient"

"At time I wsa very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took @NUM1 hours to dry. I worked harder then @ORGANIZATION1, but I kept braking my wonderful creation. The wings would break, and I patiently had to glue them back on"
" In school you have to keep patient. By the of the day you ran out of patient. You would be try to tolerate you patiens. Most of day it will be fun. Maye if you go along with it you will be cool and stay patient. But patient is something I do when it come to  ??? lunch, and the bathroom. I need lunch I have to wait for that to. Once I eat I have to be patient for gym. I have to be patient every day of the week. I need to tolerate all of it weekly. The end bye bye"
 A time when I was patient was when went to the mall. I was so patient waiting in one. That was time when I was patient. The @CAPS3.
"A momma bird was laying eggs. Days went by, and the eggs did not hatch. The momma bird got upset. She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""@CAPS1 be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got agrevated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddeling her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centurys, and milleniums went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the @NUM2 oldest birds took off in flight."""
"I was @CAPS1 excited to get my first ipad. But, there was a very long line. @CAPS1, my mom kept on telling he to be patient. @CAPS1, I just stand there quietly. Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beging of the line. When, I got up there my dad said “what kind do you want?” @CAPS1 I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day all. Then my said “stop listing to that music” @CAPS1, I put it down for about @NUM1 hurs. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy’s new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched tv and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That is the time I was being patient"

And started to bandage him up. They tried to get him to stand up but @CAPS11 wouldn't. @PERSON1 and I were wating in the house trying to wait and see if @CAPS11 was going to live. @PERSON1 decided that she was going to help out with her hourse. They carried the table with @PERSON3 on it to @CAPS8 his mom. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she set the table down. And @CAPS8 kicks @PERSON1 to the tree. The next day @PERSON2 and I were putting a tent up in the back yard. Nana called the vet to see @CAPS1 they could do. They got their @NUM1 minutes later they said that they will stich him up.

I heard the sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail bat and botted for the door. As I met the mail lady she smiled, everyday she sees me.  Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for that one letter address to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to get, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience."
""
 but I just stood there so when we did something else I was patient when we got up there I was ok it was ok ‘cause I still got to eat
"Here is a way that I had to be patient, and we all know that??? has to be patient with others. ??? Yes, it was my birthday. I wasn’t thinking of my birthday party, my cake or ice cream, no I was thinking of getting the money, first present no money. Second present, yes, there was money. It was a card so it had to have money in it. I couldn’t wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient the into this, well I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe??? so much there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyways it payed off. When I finaly got it I couldn’t believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do, if its along time, but its also a good thing to do because it pays with every time."
"Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every mustle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crows. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stoped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. In the end it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had went looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening"
"At one @CAPS2 in left you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerate. Somebody that’s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn’t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the @LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient"
 And being impatient means not writing your turn. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something don’t rush because you can mess up. Don’t go way to slow because then people will think you don’t know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don’t have patience aren’t always happy all the time
One time I had to use patience when we were driving to @CAPS1
"Being patient is hard. I hate waiting. For things days to come up, mail or packages, people, anything. Patience requires effort that dont have. I really have never been patient. I dont know many people, who are either. I am patent when I want to be (wich is never), when I want to be and when I dont realize if I will be impatient in about three seconds because @CAPS1 done with the writing page and time isn’t up yet"
"When I was @NUM1 yrs old my mom started making my @DATE1 present. She was going to make a blanket. Sadly she didn’t find the blanket. I had  and it wasn’t done, then ???. My @DATE1 was almost @NUM2 months ago ???. She ??? found a time to ??? that she ??? find ??? in @NUM3. I have been patient and every year on my @DATE1 and on @CAPS1 I ask if it is fiished but I’m not. I s ??? I can be patient for alittle while???"
" We where fishing on a cold night and no fish where bighting,. My dad was getting mad and I was still @CAPS1 listning  to the backeasard  celtcs  games.  We where only catching little fish that night nuthing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the tralor and I was pitch black and cold. I eventually had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample."
"We were going to @CAPS1. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting the to ride the skyline. After we ate, me my cousins and my??? headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole??? of cedar point. “im so excited” said one of my sisters. “yaa me too!” said the the other. We were walking towards it. When we saw the line we heaked! “this will take so long” said my sister. I was so surprised my @NUM1-year- ol cousin her??? ???. “wow it look really high” said my cousin. “@CAPS2’t, worry we have @CAPS3 with us. She’ll take care of us” said my younger sister. Finally it was our turn. There were @NUM1 small kids behind us. Wanting to go on so badly. “why @CAPS2’t you go ahead” said my cousin. I was shocked my cousin had so much patience. Usually she had start wanting to go first for everything! I was so proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. I hope we come back again!"
 It was the end of the year. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles.”
" Everyday I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I do @CAPS1 practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn’t when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone."
When I was about seven And my mom was pregnant with my @NUM1 sister. It was the night before she had her. We were all asleep. Then when my dad relized he forgot us. So when he got home to pick us up. It was already morning they took us to a room. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the deveiring room we were so paitient it took over an hour to get her out. when they were stiching my mom up the brought my little sister to get all cleand up. When we could see her through the window. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. And we all liked that name. I was so @CAPS3 that day
"Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times I’m not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. Every year I’m not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. I thought I wasn’t gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. So I told myself “be patient” over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldn’t do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me “@CAPS2!” @CAPS3 wouldn’t let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That’s a time I’ll never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That’s how I was patient, and I’m glad I was patient with my legs"
" One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset it was buring @DATE1 vacation and my little sister @ORGANIZATION1 wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream tank that rade by every twenty minuts frome the ice-cream shop which was about seven @CAPS9 ten block away.

Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said “I made mama make you some tea”. That was hart warming @CAPS9 me. After I drank it @ORGANIZATION1 asked if I felt better. I said a little then @ORGANIZATION1 got @CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and new that she didn’t fully understand yet. So I got @CAPS3 and took her @CAPS9 the ice-cream shop @CAPS9 get some ice-cream. @ORGANIZATION1 was happe ans that made me happe. I fell extremely proud that I was patient with @ORGANIZATION1 eve whe she got on me nerves. I know I was n’t patient with @ORGANIZATION1 at the “beginning” but at the end I was."
"The time I was patient was whene I went to the @CAPS1.B.I @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of training, he was there for like @NUM1 months. So there was kind of a lot of  people. We had to dress really nice. The worst part was they gave speeches. Then after what seemed like hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave.

"This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't."
"Patience, whats the first word that comes to your mind when you hear that word? Waiting? I know that’s the main word in my mind. Every kid dreads meap testing it was @DATE1 and we have to be completely silent. But it’s harder when your next to your friends, and your a girl. We had to do meap writing, writing is the most wrost for me. But when I was done I felt really good and quiet for everyone else. That’s the story when I had to be patient."

"There is many ways to be patient like while your wating in the lunch line to pat or when you line up to leav the room. Heres a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was talking to some and I wanted to go right away but I did not say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to get in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I said nothing. Then we walked in to skate but it was a long line for skates but I did not push or shoke my way through I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @CAPS1 how we be patient"
"To me,  patient is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. “Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?” I asked wondering if it would easy to get it.” @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess I’ll have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didn’t grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort."
 So we were waiting while the life guard was telling the  boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slid.  But the little boy fell of tube thing hit his head and all most drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time
 I was so proud of myself. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said “@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you don’t get this line moving then I’m going to have to talk to the waiterger.” And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?” I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that I’m never gonna be inpatient again
"Everyday at school I have to be patience to get my food like pizza,saled,sand with milk what is bad all the time but i check my milk"
"I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher’s or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teacher’s demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I’d see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That’s not the only time but, it’s the most longest time I was patient with some one."
"Patience is being able to wait for something. For some, patience is hard and for some its easy. Like I'm patiencet for this game I pre-ordered. It comes out @DATE1. When I'm not patiencet is when I want I get on the computer. I Was also patiencet for getting my second class rank, well thats all I have to say about patience"
"I have exprienced patients when I went to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 hour strip, we were in a small car and we were a little caradable because we didn’t sleep very well last night even though I brought a book & my @ORGANIZATION1 game we were still pretty bored. All I did watch trees after my battery end on my @ORGANIZATION1. Once he got into @LOCATION2 I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finish her and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you could hear, mom, @CAPS1 and my stomagh growling, we didn’t stop. At @NUM3 we were crushing through the state of @LOCATION1 to then arive at @TIME1 at the hotel we were so excited that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes in the bed."
" A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, I didn’t complain though. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn’t! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. I had to be patient because I didn’t want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast"
"A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn’t just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don’t think that I’ll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, “Patience is a virtue.”"
"I know a time when I was patient. We were gonna hang out. It was two and a half hours before he got their. When he was there we both were patient to play the game or do what others wanted to do.

"One day in the @CAPS1, I had to sit for two hours cause I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there a lot of people, we stay there a very long time, cause there were only @NUM1 docters and this lady took so long. And then I went home."

"I remember a time when I was patient. I was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. My mom couldn’t wait any longer she was about to take me home. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. Me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat."

 There is multiple ways you have to be patient at gymnastics. your body has to be patient when it feels like your ready to do a skill but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient. You have to be patient with the coaches because they are always helping. So sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes until they can finally help you. Patience is a very important life skill that everybody needs to have.
"Being patient means that you are understand and tolerant a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.

Finally the first day of school came she skipped up to him and he @CAPS3 called a way .Couple of confused weeks late she said to him are you jumping  me or ???He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time.

Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. @CAPS1 stopped talking and just waited in line . After @NUM1 long minutes of listening to music at  his ipod @CAPS5, he was @NUM2 people away from the  front of the line. Then something bad happened. “@CAPS3 this isn’t my schedule!” said a blonde girl. The person who was giving  out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule. So @NUM1 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule"

Everybody was throwing tanruns. The kids were sitting quietly at the little benches they have and watching them doing tanrums. The people that work in cedses was trying because there a lot of people and everybody was lewing. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about the pizza. The little kids that are hungry were showing patience than the angry adults. After he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut."
" For example, when I was at a resturaunt that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored so, I decide to color with crayons I got. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk, went to the bathroom. When I came back our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. Good things always come to people that are patient. If your not a patient person then you can always try to become one. It’s not very hard just keep yourself occupied!"
When it was @DATE1 @CAPS1 and I could not wait for @DATE1 so I open my gifts. My mom and dad give my sister and my second sister and me us.

 The one time I was patient is when my mom took me to go get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there the parking lot was full I mean cars was so close you could hardly get in and out without scratching someones car. My mom parked across the streets the streets. People were standing so close to each other you would know their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were parked like dardine. It was hot and smelled like must. We picked a ticket with @NUM3 on and they were on @NUM4. We waited for two hours. My mum wanted to leave. When they got to our number I was sleep. Wile we was in there I lost ten pounds.
 I was patient when I went to the doctors. It felt like years but it was alone for @NUM1 hour then when the doctor called us back to the room wait for a long period of time and a nother half-hour we waited.

First stop they went to the gas station then post office, then to the car wash, then finally to the grocery store. At the grocery store @ORGANIZATION1 helps her @CAPS1 shop. All day @ORGANIZATION1 was patient and didn’t complain once. “The last item on the list is pasta for dinner,” @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1. “@CAPS7 I can’t seem to find it.” “I’ll go find it. @ORGANIZATION1 looks down every aisle until she finally finds the pasta her @CAPS1 wants.

They we got on a lot of ride .but the best one was the diagster . Then I relised  I was  very  patient"
 It was the most boring thing @CAPS3! Imagine just driving in a car for @NUM1 hours just driving and stopping to use the bathroom. So when we finally ??? ??? still had to wait @NUM2 more hours. But when we finaly got there we had a blast! And I have to admit one good thing came from experience ??? rides don’t bother us??? ???.
"A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well I get out of school at @TIME1 my dad gets at @TIME2So,if  I wanted his  help , I would have to wait myself  but I didn’t understand it. Even with homework that needed help on back in my backpack until my dad got home I wished the homework that didn’t need help on. After my homework   that which I did all my @CAPS1, then it was time to eat, as I ate my dinner."
"On @DATE1 my friend @CAPS1 and I climbed on the bus headed for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together till @NUM1 am. The sign out front said “wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours”, but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started a @NUM5 p m and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said “@CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6” all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste a elephant ear on my tounge. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. Caenevil well it was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take fourty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my head rest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more of spooky directions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day l learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did."
"Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it everyday. I need it for basketball.  There could be a lot of different   reasons that some one would need to be patient.                My first one is when people don’t pay attention. It frusterates me. When the team members   goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. gets mad. She  will  either  tell us to knock  it  off or she will  make us run  a couple  laps  around  the gym. My first reason leads to my second.The  second  thing that urks  me is when people don’t pay attention, they  get lost  and  have  no club  what  is  going  on.  There is a  lot  of people who  take  a long  time  to  catch  on.  My second leads to my third.My third is when somebody new joins the team.  We  just  had  to  new  people  join  the  other  day  and   the  season  is  half  over.   The newest member of the team can not make a shot.  She doesn’t put all of her effort into it. There  is  only  like  @NUM2 out  of  @NUM3  or  @NUM4 people  that  is  actually good.looking  over  my paper, all of  this  I have  to be  patient  about. If  I  wasn’t, I would  be  in trouble  and  it  would  mean  I  would  have  bad  sportsmanship.  I deal  with  it  and  put  up  with  all  of   this  though. Over the years I learned about patience. I learned how to be patient too.  I’m  glad I  know  how to be now  or  else  where   would  I  be?  Probably not on any teams or in any clubs."
" “You can’t do this to me. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I can’t leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work honey!” “@CAPS4 can’t you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year!” @CAPS2’s mother sighed. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 “@CAPS7 if!”. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2’s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county’s only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. “@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment” @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother’s red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, “@CAPS12, why don’t you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting “little” @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they’ve asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2 we need to talk.” @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,” honey, you’ve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe he’d still be game for you."
 He quietly waited day after day for the game.But one day after school it arrived
" There was this thing I wanted and I was going to drive me, but just before I got out the door, the phone rang. “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “hold on @PERSON1 I’m on the phone, I’m not gonna take you now!” and walked away"
 In the @DATE1 time my mom had planned of trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. So finally we made it to @LOCATION1.
