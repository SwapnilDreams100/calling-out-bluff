"Don't feel so bad,.It's just the way the wheel turns.Stay in where it's quiet,.And where the sick burns.And I never meant to make you feel alone,.I never meant to hide.And I never thought I'd make you see the light,.Before it was your time.I'm losing you.I'm losing you.Back straight, arms down,.Lift the weight off your shoulders.Take your time, take it slow.Get ready for the end.I'm losing you.I'm losing you.Light head.Cold sweat.Find the vein.And deliver (x4).I'm losing you.I'm losing you"
Place outside where I pass to waste my time.In the shadows of the dark you'll find.Behind sleepless eyes there's a woman.Taste of my sweet.Love like defeat can be so cruel.It can fill you full for a while.You're a lamb with fangs.Girl dressed like crimson flames.So they see it.You're like a bad burn.But they never let you try.Just to feel it.Taste of my sweet.Love like defeat can be so cruel.It can fill you full of wild dreams.And the back of your knees.Can you bend them for me please.I could meet you for a while.Dressed so plain.I put my head in a frame.And the paints just words I scream.Wrapped up in a pretty string.I leave a prize at the heels of your feet.Taste of my sweet.Love like defeat can be so cruel.It can fill you full of wild dreams.And the back of your knees darling.Can you bend them for me please.I could meet you for a while
Fixin' to run through the woods.Leaving cause I know I should.I know a good sign when I see one.Wanted to be understood.Tried in this town but I couldn't scream anymore.At the voices inside of my head.Next to the bed on my knees I said with a sigh.Have to go.Please don't try to stop me.I know you can't save me this time.Don't you want a new?.So do I....I miss the afternoon breeze.The way that it felt on my feet.I could speak my mind.I was just fine.Saw who I needed to be.Long dirty road made me see I'm a different man.You could see it.I know that you can.Have to go.Please don't try to stop me.I know you can't save me this time.Don't you want a new?.So do I... (x2)
"Play, Twenty-seven ways.To get outta town today.Fool around, how may.Got my shoulders straight anyway.You make that hopeless feeling okay.I feel the weight of the world unchain.Told, to be a certain way.To be alive is dying for change.You're alright, I lay.Got your shoulders straight anyway.You make that hopeless feeling okay.I feel the weight of the world unchain.I could scream for angels, only catch the side of a ray.We could talk about it anyway"
"Left the keys on the table.Cause I know I could be a bit more sober.To try to drive and find you.But I might walk to get a little closer.Don't you know there has to be some understanding.I don't expect for you to understand it all.Wish I could blame the weather.Or some disease that makes me feel much colder.Or the man on the moon as he shouts my name when I get much older.There's got to be a way to stop my shaking.Bones and rusty knees and start explaining.Would you be my eyes.Cause I feel so damn blinded by the lies.Told to me by strangers that pass me by.If you could give me a smile I could give you mine.Don't you know there has to be some understanding.I don't expect for you to understand it all.I was right.I never told a lie that I didn't like.I got you by my side.Hey don't that mean I tried.Tried, tried....Would you be eyes.Cause I feel so damn blinded by the lies.Told to me by strangers that pass me by.If you could give me a smile I could give you mine"
"A dime in my pocket's a diamond in my hand.choose your religion, can't change an honest man.because I found jesus with the slight in his hand.building things lately that are meant to rust.saving your pennies, that's like man to lust.pennies won't save you when your heart is dust.Be so selfish you try ahead and run.choose your religion you're not the only one.because I found jesus not the only one"
"Your lips make horrible sounds.They talkin' words from your mouth.I found two mice in the kitchen they help me to summon you out.I hear you talkin' at night.There's something blind in your eyes.Dreaming the teeth of your lover, who swallow you up with your pride.I won't watch you while you dress tonight.I wanna know what it is to light this thing on fire.Wanna taste what it is you're breathing.Wanna take the air you feed me to my side.You know it's time for your bath.So take that dress off your back.Oh will we fight for tomorrow.Scream at the moon for a laugh.I won't watch you while you dress tonight (x2).I wanna know what it is to light this thing on fire.Wanna taste what it is you're breathing.Wanna take the air you feed me to my side (x2).Hey now girl.Where you gonna run.Somehow.Ride back down.Slipping on that filthy sound.Just like you to scream it out your dirty mouth (x2).Your lips make horrible sounds"
It's been three days of seen my eyes.Don't need another discuss.Pull my head from the sky.A weekend of lost my tune.Don't need to play the fool.If you're kicked out of the pool.Silence at the foot of the elephant's bed.I don't believe everything that I've read.From the mental I know what you took.I could read you like an open book.You're never of your hub.Why are you such a pain.I don't mean to complain.But you're driving me insane.Silence at the foot of the elephant's bed.I don't believe everything that I've read.You're looking for a discuss.I will give a white dress for you.I don't mean to be mean.Do you know what I mean.I would climb any wall in your house.Just for you darling.But too reach to see.Do you know what I mean
"Say something, I'm giving up on you.I'll be the one, if you want me to.Anywhere, I would've followed you.Say something, I'm giving up on you.And I am feeling so small.It was over my head.I know nothing at all.And I will stumble and fall.I'm still learning to love.Just starting to crawl.Say something, I'm giving up on you.I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.Anywhere, I would've followed you.Say something, I'm giving up on you.And I will swallow my pride.You're the one that I love.And I'm saying goodbye.Say something, I'm giving up on you.And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.And anywhere, I would have followed you.Oh, oh, oh, oh say something, I'm giving up on you.Say something, I'm giving up on you.Say something"
"You are in my bed.I heard what you said.Well you were in my bed.So I heard what you said.Should we nip this bud?.Can we give this up?.We're not wasting time.I'm with you for life.And it got colder.Every day.But I wouldn't change my mind.It got darker.Every night.But I wouldn't change my mind, no.Should we nip this bud?.Can we give this up?.We're not wasting time.I'm with you for life.And it got colder.Every day.But I wouldn't change my mind.It got darker.Every night.But I wouldn't change my mind, no.I never thought that you would become my greatest friend.I never thought that you would become my greatest friend.And it got colder.Every day.But I wouldn't change my mind.It got darker.Every night.But I wouldn't change my mind.I'm a sucker for you.I'm a sucker for you"

"Lately, what's the problem? What's the headline this time?.Somehow, we're okay with all these differences leaving us blind, blind, blind.I'm not scared of fighting; I'm just a little bit over this conversation.I'm not trying to hide it; I'm just thinking slowly.Maybe you and I can live together if we ever learn to ease the tension.Maybe the world isn't crazy; maybe it's you and I, I, I.I found the truth in the distance; I heard the words in the wind.And on it goes like wildfire, it's spreading, from past lives to the living.Who's changing, the people or times, times, times?.I'm not scared of fighting; I'm just a little bit over this conversation.I'm not trying to hide it; I'm just thinking slowly.Maybe you and I can live together if we ever learn to ease the tension.Maybe the world isn't crazy; maybe it's you and I, I, I.Lost with a cause someone wrote down on a paper.That defines all the lines that we draw.But, we don't understand what's unstable.Maybe we're all lonely and afraid.Maybe we're all trying to find the words to say.Maybe we just need love, love, love, love....I'm not scared of fighting; I'm just a little bit over this conversation.I'm not trying to hide it; I'm just thinking slowly.Maybe you and I can live together if we ever learn to ease the tension.Maybe the world isn't crazy; maybe the world isn't crazy.Maybe the world isn't crazy, maybe it's you and I, I, I"

"I found life and I found laughter..In forgiveness, I found rest..On the shoulders of redemption,.I found hope when hope was dead..I could lose it in a moment,.So I dare not close my eyes..I'll watch fear fall with the sunset.And see hope rise with the tide..And when the pain is true,.Sometimes these troubles prove that I'm alive..My eyes are open,.My heart is beating,.My lungs are full,.And my body's breathing..I'm moving forward..I found my freedom..I found the life that gave me reason to live..As this dusty road now settles.And I see what lay before,.Every tear that held a broken dream.Is now shattered on the floor..And now bursting forth in splendor.Are the blossoms of second tries.Because dreams that bear the mark of love.Are dreams that never die..Sometimes.Life can feel so unkind..Sorrow won't define me.So just reminds my soul..My soul"

"Well he ripped a boge.Right to the end.And he said you listen good my cousin, Manhattan ain't got nothing on a good friend.So when your fast cash goes.And your bats won't bend.He said you call me up my cousin, Manhattan ain't got nothing on a good friend.And I thanked him for his great escape.But I think I'm staying here.'Cause there's bills to miss and there's plans to break.And nobody ever would stay awake back home.Well she wrote her name.With a Mont Blanc pen.She said you call me when you need me, Manhattan gets so rough without a good friend.And the ones who break they don't know to bend.So don't get too confident too quickly, Manhattan chews you up when you pretend.And I thanked her for her sage advice.But I'm doing okay here.Because all these restaurants are overpriced.They all stay open late at night.And mistakes are nice, they make me feel at home.Well I called my sister in the summer said I'm thinking about moving here.She said do it now before you get a job and get married can't go nowhere.But now I can't go nowhere because there's too many chances here.I must admit I miss my friends but I'm staying here"
"She never drove, never climbed, never walked another road.And ever since I can remember in November she's a wilted rose.But in the summer she lights right up from her head down to her toes.Call me crazy but I blow a little kiss when I go.And her necklace is simple it compliments her clothes.Any day she'll pick a fight or pick a flower no one ever knows.She turns inches to miles when I watch her in the snow.Call me crazy, I blow a little kiss when I go.Little face, little face, she's got a pretty little face.Little face, little face, she's got a pretty little face.Everybody's talking 'bout her.Little face, little face, she's got a pretty little face.Little face, little face, she's got a pretty little face.Throw a party and see the pretty presents that she brings.And I'd be lying if I said she's never stolen anything.She may not know the finest wines, but she knows a fast way home.So call me crazy but I blow a little kiss when I go.[chorus].Oh and time, time, time in time she drifts away.Every time I've gone away.The freckles change upon her face.[repeat].But the previous arrangement I never forget.'Cause me and her we go together like coffee and cigarettes.I pack up quickly and never can wait to hit the road.Call me crazy but I blow a little kiss when I go"
"He ties his bags around his thighs.Newspaper bags filled with newspaper lies.And combs his hair, straightens his tie.But the people still stare the people want to know why.He chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life.After all these years when she was alive.He stood in the corner and he built a disguise.Now that she's gone, the house won't rise.So he sits on a milk crate with a handsaw to the sky.He chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life.So don't call me man, don't call me boy anymore.Take or leave your crown behind and I'll cry your name in war.And there's rocks in windows that Michael threw.And this weeks window...it's for you.He dropped out of Amherst in his second year.And now he's digging holes for the state.And he lays so still in the morning chill.'Cause he's having trouble sleeping late.And he pours down the concrete on 7th street.And the children come up slow with open hands.And as they set them in, he's ashamed within.'Cause he knows that once they walk away he'll just go fill it up again.He chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life.Oh and I should go, but can I stay?.Just one more song and I'll be on my way.Don't' call me man don't call me boy.Don't call me man don't call me boy.When he lost his home, and his face grew thin.He traded her dresses for a used violin.And when he raised the wood and touched it to his chin.He whispered who I am, ain't nothing like the wasted man I've been.He chose to fill the air with echoes of an ordinary life.Far away we go.We go far away.We go so far that you can't even see us grow"
"Take me as I come, I come alone.Take me as I go, I'm going nowhere.But if there's someone I should me.Or someplace I should be I will convene.Life if getting hard I hardly work.Things are getting soft, too soft to hear.If there's a job that I should take.Or a sound that I should make I will surrender.Everything I thought I needed now.Every little thing I own is taped away in cardboard.Every little thing I needed new.Every single thing I own is taped away.Streets I used to take I never use them.Footsteps I would trace I never follow.But there's a reason to return.And trails left to burn.I fill my gas tank.I left you all my notes.I left them on the stairs.I left them on the stairs that day with you.I lost my right to vote.I lost it on the stairs.I lost it on the stairs that day with you.My friend for you.So look me up and down I'm feeling shallow.Look me in the eye there's nothing deep.If there's a poet who might know the way my story goes.I'll let him finish"
"It's been the same old day in this town.And my head won't stop hanging down.No my head won't stop hanging down.It's just the kind of day when your friends don't come around.And my head won't stop hanging down.No my head won't stop hanging down.A street gang tried to take my pride, tried to take my money and phone.No train, no fame, cold rain, and I forgot my umbrella at home.Please ask me my opinion of the war and politicians out wasting my dough.When they tell me that I don't know nothing, I just tell them that there's nothing to know.'Cause it's been the same old day in this town.And my head won't stop hanging down.No my head won't stop hanging down.It's just the kind of day that your friends don't come around.And my head won't stop hanging down.No my head won't stop hanging down.I grew up in a Crate and Barrel home and if you could then you certainly can.I'm a good son, good brother, good lover but I sure ain't much of a man.So you think that you know me boy? You think you watched what I became?.Well you better know that what I do and who I am is never the same.[chorus].And the love of a woman ain't gonna save my sorry day.I need something between just a near drink of beam and a river to sweep me away.I ain't gonna share my bed so you can nod your head and tell me it will be okay.[chorus]"
"Well you called but you never did knock.Well you called but my ears they were busy and blocked.So I leaned on the door, fell asleep standing tall.And dreamt that your fist might awake me.And the young we can drift far from home.But we never can get very far all alone.On a tower, in a cave.Just a credit card away.I can't seem to outgrow my history.When I die, leave a stone on my grave.That's the place to remember my face.When I die, leave a stone on my grave.Leave a stone on my grave to remember.She extended her laugh writing fiction in photographs.Fake 'cause it's tape, but more real than unseen.Then she stares at her shape every day like a ghost.Who's haunting his son before heaven.There are people I still like to know.And I few who I wouldn't be sad to see go.But I'm stuck on an aisle that's charted and known.And these bridges won't burn on their own.Oh and boy, baby boy only seventeen years seventeen.Oh and boy, baby boy, it's five less than me.Oh and I know so much less than it seems.Oh but I can admit to the nothing I've seen"
"When you go, take my coat with you.So when it snows I'll stay wrapped around your shoulders.When you drink, raise your glass to me.And you can think of all the inconvenient ways the days would pass for me and you.And if you sing, sing my songs.'Cause if you sang anyone else's you won't think of me for nearly.As long as I live I'll always find your socks in my bed.My bed, socks in my bed, my bed, my little bed.I always find your socks in my bed, my bed.I'll always find your socks in my bed.And in the morning, whisper softly.'Cause these walls are paper thing.Take a pair of my Golden Toes.And was them in your laundry and I'll use them when we sleep on 33rd.And when we're old, old and grey.Would you properly issue pills into the pillbox that I need for the day.That I die will be the day there aren't socks in my bed.[chorus].Well there was a mouse and I found him in the bathroom of your.Second floor apartment but you thought he was adorable.So I watched as he navigated mazes you created using empty paper towel rolls and boots.So if you sing, sing my songs.'Cause if you sing anyone else's you won't think of me for nearly as long.As I live, I'll always find your socks in my bed"
"Dawn is homeless on a suitcase by the train.While city princes hail cabs to beat the rain.Stacks of books she never reads.She never begs.There's reservations on her mind and in her head.I spend my days searching for my soul.And as we roar along the truth is left untold.I know my brother came and turned some heads before.But that was then.And this is someone else's war.Covered faces on the pictures and the news.Are covered faces in my home and in my shoes.A bigger stage should make it quicker than before.But now it's jeans not oily key that open doors.All the buildings are selling poison on the street.They probably brand a better ground for better feet.She breaks her back to have the cash to break her face.And even worse my broken heart, my broken faith"

"Wishing I was dreaming,.Wishing I didn't know..All the thoughts I was thinking,.I don't want to know..Everyone's always moving,.I'm standing still for all the time..Thoughts that I was living,.Echoes in my mind..There's so much more that I could be,.So many places that I'll never see..So many lives that I'll never meet..I'll just dream until we get there in the end..Always thinking 'bout tomorrow,.Before today is even through..Always thinking 'bout the future,.What on earth will happen to you?.There's so much more that I could be,.So many places that I'll never see..So many lives that I'll never meet..I'll just dream until we get there in the end..And if the world stops spinning,.Would I start moving home?.And if the world stopped dreaming,.Would I stop believing in it all?.There's so much more that I could be,.So many places that I'll never see..So many lives that I'll never meet..I'll just dream until we get there in the end..I'll just dream until we get there in the end..I'll just dream until we get there in the end."
"I never felt like this before.Try to hold it back and I feel it even more.Sweat drips down my spine and my knees are weak.I can not move, I can not speak.But then you came and I held it together again.I managed to stumble through.Fifty thousand voices singing in the rain.There's nothing that I wouldn't do.'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to.I'd swim the seven seas.I'll be the one to hold your torch again.I'll do anything you ask of me.'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to.I'd swim the seven seas.I'll be the one to hold your torch again.I'll do anything you ask of me.I never knew how proud I would feel.Just standing in the rain..These three words mean everything to me.And I'd sing it again and again..'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to.I'd swim the seven seas.I'll be the one to hold your torch again.I'll do anything you ask of me.'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to.I'd swim the seven seas.I'll be the one to hold your torch again.I'll do anything you ask of me.Well the blue and the white of the flag shines bright.And it's blowing there for me..With my hand on my heart, the honest truth.There's nowhere I'd rather be..'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to.I'd swim the seven seas.I'll be the one to hold your torch again.I'll do anything you ask of me.'Cause I'd move mountains if you asked me to.I'd swim the seven seas.I'll be the one to hold your torch again.I'll do anything you ask of me"
"Wave your flag high above your head,.You deserve to smile, celebrate in style..'Cause everything that depressed you now is gone..And eighteen days while the world looked on,.You stood your ground, kept holding strong..Eighteen days while the world looked on..Across the Nile there are stars tonight.And they shine much brighter than before..Across the Nile there's peace and love tonight.And it shows much stronger than before..Much stronger than before..Free and fair life they said it would be,.Cross our fingers, wait and see.And dream of a better day..And across the world you've shown them all.That hope and strength can conquer all..Will we stand together again?.Across the Nile there are stars tonight.And they shine much brighter than before..Across the Nile there's peace and love tonight.And it shows much stronger than before..Much stronger than before..Hope and strength can conquer all,.You've shown the world how the mighty fall..And across the Nile there are stars.Much brighter than before."
"Oh my dance is getting slower now,.'Cause my years they're getting older now..And my eyes, they won't cry..My tears have all run dry..And my memory doesn't get me very far,.I can't remember my name or exactly who you are..And I don't know why, no I don't know why..Will you please believe.I'm not the person you see,.I left that body long ago..I left it way back there..Will you please believe,.Given all that you see,.I left that body long ago.But somehow nobody knows..So goodbye,.You were my world and my life..And I don't know why.You've lost your mother, lost your wife..But there's more,.Something more than meets the eye..This is not the end,.This is only goodbye..Will you please believe.I'm not the person you see,.I left that body long ago..I left it way back there..Now I'm free, I'm as happy as can be..I just wanted you to know.That I left that body long ago..So long ago."
"Listen to my heart as it beats for you.And it's telling you the things that I never could..And it's laying it down on the line for you..And the years are catching up, I can see it on your face..And the days of being young and free.Are left there with the memories that blow in the wind..And I can feel it coming when the Monday morning blues,.They last all through the week, I feel it on Sunday too..And I can feel it coming when my knees feel weak.And I can not speak the truth..The days of being young, the days of being free..They're etched upon my face in every light that you see..The stories I could tell, the lies are told as well..What I wouldn't give to live it all again..The years are passing, every single day..Where did they go? Did you take them all away?.Now I'm older and brave..And the children, they all left. They fled their family nest..And now we're all alone.And the house don't feel like home anymore, anymore..Then I can feel it coming when the Monday morning blues,.They last all through the week, I feel it on Sunday too..And I can feel it coming when my knees feel weak.And I can not speak the truth..The days of being young, the days of being free..They're etched upon my face in every light that you see..The stories I could tell, the lies are told as well..What I wouldn't give to live it all again..And in my baby's eyes I lived it all again,.The fear, the surprise, everything..In my baby's eyes I lived it all again.And I wouldn't change anything..And in my baby's eyes I lived it all again.And I wouldn't change anything."
