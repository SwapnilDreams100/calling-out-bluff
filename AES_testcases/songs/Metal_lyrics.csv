"Once shadows called I saddled my horse.To the heights I rode over misty mountains.Through days of cold I battled by the sword.From wars blood I drank the flaming breath of strife.The gods were young none ruled under the sky.At the end of worlds began the time of alliance.Forsworn to gold, men sold their sword to kings.Steel were made for those above the din of battle.I see my ride where gods once rode.I see my ride where gods once rode.Great fathers of the sky, fathers of the gods.And the mighty mountain I ride under heavy skies.For the will of iron and the pride of my kind.Looked in the fire of thy doom.The prophecies were all true.Now the world is ending to.The end of days shall come soon.I see my ride where gods once rode.I see my ride where gods once rode"
"I rode for the moments once under red sky.Born for the wars fearless inside.I fought for the honor, great kingdoms and ground.Once proud a warrior northborn a son.Gods live on to battle kings live under sigh.Warriors hunger blood with death in the eye.I"
"Somewhere in time there was a dream.A dream I felt deep inside.That no one could understand.Where do I go now?.When will I find my way?.All The Lies I've left behind.Seem so far now from my mind.Now I take I look inside, what's left of me.From the life that once was mine.I tried to heal the wounds of time.Never really did believe the lies were real.From beyond I'm reminded of a memory.Now its gone into the gray of the moment.Where do I go now?.When will I find my way?.All The Lies I've left behind.Seem so far now from my mind.Now I take I look inside, what's left of me.From the life that once was mine.I tried to heal the wounds of time.Never really did believe the lies were real.Where do I go now?.When will I find my way?.All The Lies I've left behind.Seem so far now from my mind.Now I take I look inside, what's left of me.From the life that once was mine.I tried to heal the wounds of time.Never really did believe the lies were real"
"Running hard through the snow.No idea where to go.Is there someone there in front of me?.Try so hard, still can't see.Change the path, fight the urge.To give up, to let go.Will someone come rescue me?.How did this come to be?.Far away from a normal town.Feel so lost, starting to drown.I know who's done this me.Not the work of a mortal being.Came so close in the dead of the night.Didn't hear a whisper but felt the fright.Lifted high above me.Shadows were all that I could see.I don't know whom to trust.Tell me where can I run?.To the left or to the right.There is nowhere to hide.I am just one of the many abducted.No one is sane.In the land of the Midnight Sun.Still have so far to go.Escaped their clutch; that I know.Are they coming after me?.Do I have a chance to flee?.A faint scream distantly.Another caught and now is gone.Why is no one helping us?.What's to become of us?.Far away from a normal town.Feel so lost, starting to drown.I know who's done this me.Not the work of a mortal being.Came so close in the dead of the night.Didn't hear a whisper but felt the fright.Lifted high above me.Shadows were all that I could see.I don't know whom to trust.Tell me where can I run?.To the left or to the right.There is nowhere to hide.I am just one of the many abducted.No one is sane.In the land of the Midnight Sun.I don't know who to trust.Tell me where can I run?.To the left or to the right.There is nowhere to hide.I am just one of the many abducted.No one is sane.In the land of the Midnight Sun.I don't know where to rung.Tell me who can I trust?.Far ahead behind.There is nowhere to hide.I am just one of the one who were taken.No one is safe.In the land of the Midnight Sun.Whoa are you now?.I don't know whom to trust.Tell me where can I run?.To the left or to the right.There is nowhere to hide.I am just one of the many abducted.No one is sane.In the land of the Midnight Sun.I don't know where to rung.Tell me who can I trust?.Far ahead behind.There is nowhere to hide.I am just one of the one who were taken.No one is safe.In the land of the Midnight Sun"
I know the games they play.But it's not for me to say.They take the dreams away.And only the scars remain.I'll go another way.Avoid the light of day.And take a chance.That will lead me back home once again.It all comes down to this.We must all coexist.Welcome My Friend Of Mysery.It's been so lons since we set on.......Our journey through eternity.And all of the worlds we left behind.Time has been kind to you and me.No matter what comes we must carry on.Flying on wings of destiny.Through infinity and what lies beyond.A tempting melody beckons invitingly.Draws me closer to the force.That keeps me Earthbound.Our past is swept away.Vanished into thin air.They trapped us once again.Now we take yet another futile spin.It all comes down to this.We must all coexist.Welcome My Friend Of Mysery.It's been so lons since we set on.......Our journey through eternity.And all of the worlds we left behind.Time has been kind to you and me.No matter what comes we must carry on.Flying on wings of destiny.Through infinity and what lies beyond.Just hold my hand.And don't ever let go.Follow me to the other side.Where so few go

Sometimes at night I feel them.Waiting for the dawn.I hear them call out to me; no one do I see.I wander alone through the rain.Drifting I hear them calling;.This time there's no uncertainty.From the depths below.Where only demons dare to go.Resonates the unseen force.Rising through the fragile core.After the rain comes crashing down.Who will be left to sing the songs?.And when the new day has begun;.who'll wipe the tears away?.After the rain comes crashing down.There's no one left to carry on.And then the bells begin to chime.For whom it tolls tonight?.Silently I slip into their lair.Never a doubt as I see the despair;.I sense it everywhere.Now I know what must be done.I take a final look and then I'm gone.My story will live forever on!.From the depths below.Where only demons dare to go.Resonates the unseen force.Rising through the fragile core.After the rain comes crashing down.Who will be left to sing the songs?.And when the new day has begun;.who'll wipe the tears away?.After the rain comes crashing down.There's no one left to carry on.And then the bells begin to chime.For whom it tolls tonight?.From far away they came to elighten us.Offering to change the ways.That have led us down the road to rein
Nights I spend awake.Waiting for the sign.Days never ended.When will the time arrive?.Far beyond my sight.Hiding in the dark.A semblance of a feeling that was lost.But now is found.As I take a look around me.Never did I feel so lonely.In the dream.The voice had told me.Now it's time.For A Different Story.Ever will I know.What lies inside my mind?.Searching through my pride.I find no place to hide.Blindly still I go.And leave the past behind.Faithfully embrace the light.As I take a look around me.Never did I feel so lonely.In the dream.The voice had told me.Now it's time.For A Different Story
"Without you, without you.Thenights are long, cold dark.Without you, without you, I'm yearning.Foryour sinful touch.Far away we will find our own way.In decay we will fade into the light.I know you're always with me.Together just you and me.I know you're right beside me.The Ghost Within Me.I know you're always near me.Forever we will always be.I feel deep inside of me.The Ghost Within my Heart.Without you, without you, I feel so empty inside.Without you, without you, I walk into the endless.night.Far away we will find our own way.In decay we will fade into the light.I know you're always with me.Together just you and me.I know you're right beside me.The Ghost Within Me.I know you're always near me.Forever we will always be.I feel deep inside of me.The Ghost Within my Heart.Far away from the lives we used to know.All I ever wanted was to be with you"
"From long ago, before the storm.I knew that I was alone.Left to my world, strange and unknown.Now it has take its toll.There was a dream, that brought me here.Far away, far from my home.There was a dream, that brought me here.Far away, far away and alone.Fate's not smiled down on me.Still I cry for my reprieve.Time slips by, never here.Always gone, never seems so near.All along, you were the one.That planted the seed, deep inside me.Dreams go on, one into one.Never a doubt, that you were beside me.Still I'm strong, I will go on.Even though, you have abandoned me.You've closed the door, trapped my soul.But one day I will be free!.Just let me be, here in my peace.Where I can be alone with thoughts.No company, just misery.And the burden of what has become of us all.There was a dream, that brought me here.Far away, far from my home.There was a dream, that brought me here.Far away, far away and alone.Fate's not smiled down on me.Still I cry for my reprieve.Time slips by, never here.Always gone, never seems so near.All along, you were the one.That planted the seed, deep inside me.Dreams go on, one into one.Never a doubt, that you were beside me.Still I'm strong, I will go on.Even though, you have abandoned me.You've closed the door, trapped my soul.But one day I will be free!.All along, you were the one.That planted the seed, deep inside me.Dreams go on, one into one.Never a doubt, that you were beside me.Still I'm strong, I will go on.Even though, you have abandoned me.You've closed the door, trapped my soul.But one day I will be free!"
"I felt so complete, so alive, always at ease.You by my side, never to leave.I always knew you'd be taken from me.Days go by and I'm left with the sadness.Time chasing time leads to my madness.Another place, a different window.A new path for me to go through.Why did you leave me this way?.When all I ever wanted was just one more day.In Your Eyes I see the hidden treasure.In Your Eyes I see my life.Take me on your final journey.Take me back into your arms.Why did you leave me this way?.When all I ever wanted was just one more day.In Your Eyes I see the hidden treasure.In Your Eyes I see my life.Far beyond the light I feel your inner torment.Far beyond the night I hear your cries.Can you hear me when I call you?.Are you afraid of what surrounds you?.From beyond the dark I'll find you.No matter what hell I go through.In Your Eyes I see the hidden treasure.In Your Eyes I see my life.Far beyond the light I feel your inner torment.Far beyond the night I hear your cries.Take me on your final journey.Take me back into your arms.In Your Eyes I see the glory.In Your Eyes I see my life"
As I look upon my life.There's a memory of a child.That I knew so long ago.In a distant point in time.We were once so young and free.That's where I still long to be.In the warmness of a love.That was yours and was mine.Sometimes when alone.I still think of you.Memories Of Another Time.When we were young.And the world was ours.Memories Of Another Time.We stood as one.And we never faltered.Running free under the sun.Our days had just begun.Carefree glances instead of words.Not a worry in the world.Hand in hand.We marched through time.From our childhood and beyond.Every time I close my eyes.You are all that I see.Sometimes when alone.I still think of you.Memories Of Another Time.When we were young.And the world was ours.Memories Of Another Time.We stood as one.And we never faltered.One step that's wrong can throw.Your world into the unknown.One step that's wrong can throw.Your world into the darkness.One voice unheard.Turns to silence in the void.One wheel that turns is heard.In the calm before the storm.Sometimes when alone.I still think of you.Memories Of Another Time.When we were young.And the world was ours.Memories Of Another Time.We stood as one.And we never faltered
From The Gutter To The Throne.All the dark places man has gone.There's so much to learn.In front of us.All the sadness we have known.And the madness we have shown.Can we escape the wheel.We're stuck upon?.From beginning to end.All the time that we've spent.Chasing dreams.As the veil ascends.Will we cease to pretend that we're free?.Led to all of the hate.Countless fears.As the darkness descends.Will we ever transcend.And find out what it means?.We're the ones that failed to grow.Even though we've lived before.In this land that has replenished us.One day soon will come a storm.That will wash away all that's born.All the will remain will be forsaken.Take a look in the mirror.Do you like what you see?.Is your reflection getting clearer.Is it what you like it to be?.The books have all been written.Now it's up to history.Our final days are getting nearer.It's time to rise up and be free?.From beginning to end.All the time that we've spent.Chasing dreams.As the veil ascends.Will we cease to pretend that we're free?.Led to all of the hate.Countless fears.As the darkness descends.Will we ever transcend.And find out what it means?.There's a hand made of stone.Holding down our ascent.Truth be known.We stand alone.All alone.Take a look in the mirror.Do you like what you see?.Is your reflection getting clearer.Is it what you like it to be?.The books have all been written.Now it's up to history.Our final days are getting nearer.It's time to rise up and be free?.From beginning to end.All the time that we've spent.Chasing dreams.As the veil ascends.Will we cease to pretend that we're free?.Led to all of the hate.Countless fears.As the darkness descends.Will we ever transcend.And find out what it means?.From The Gutter To The Throne...
Did you know the past?.Did you know that it holds the key.To the part of your mind.That unlocks your memories?.Future fades too fast.Fades away from you and me.Will we be the last.To find the truth to the greatest mystery?.I know a place just follow me there.And I will show you what lies ahead.A different space out there somewhere.Between the living and the dead.The Best I Yet To Come.Our work has just begun.The road that lies ahead.Will lead to brighter days.Don't be afraid to try.I know you're wondering why.But in the end you'll see.And you will believe.Some things just have to be.In the final dance.Will you take a chance with me?.Call it happenstance.Call it out destiny.The Best I Yet To Come.Our work has just begun.The road that lies ahead.Will lead to brighter days.Don't be afraid to try.I know you're wondering why.But in the end you'll see.And you will believe.The final moments have begun.OUr world is waking up.We take the steps to build upon.It's time for the world to see.Let's take a chance before it's gone.And tear the castles down.We'll chase them all out on the run.And set our spirits free
"Standing here.right in front of me.A Ghost from my memories.It's plain to see, but I don't believe.It's wrong , I know, I know.How can I believe.When all my life it seems.The truth has been always kept from me.Although I do feel strong..Never will I trust.the lies that they spew.All of my hopes and.dreams will come true.Some say forever more.But I don't have time at all.Some try to even the score.But I just don't know what for.Some lie when they say goodbye.They'd rather live in denial.Some die to be reborn.But I'd rather not conform.Fate, you see,.plays a game with me.It tears me up inside.It frightens me, to the core of me.And never lets me go.How can I retrieve.What I thought was meant for me.When all of my life it seems.The truth has kept me strong.Never will I trust.the lies that they spew.All of my hopes and.dreams will come true.Some say forever more.But I don't have time at all.Some try to even the score.But I just don't know what for.Some lie when they say goodbye.They'd rather live in denial.Some die to be reborn.But I'd rather not conform.Destiny and reality.Manifest eternity.It's plain to see.right in front of me.Where it was all along.Never will I trust.the lies that they spew.All of my hopes and.dreams will come true.Some say.Some try.Some lie.Some die.Some die"
