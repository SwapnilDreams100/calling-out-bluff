What's a million dollars if your girl's been abused?.What's a fancy Rolls Royce if your friend is being accused?.What's a noble lady if she's got cancer in her head?.What's a medal of honour if all your comrades are left for dead?.What's a fuckin' big house if it doesn't make you feel at home?.What's a Christian lesbian if she is cursed by The Church of Rome?.What you own means nothing.What you gets means nothing.What you are means nothing.What's a crown of gold if you are fighting aids and lose?.What's a new born baby if mommy dear only loves the booze?.What's a world-wide-selling major if you lose your only son?.What's a graduation if a friend commits sucide with your gun?
"Sometimes when I sleep.I can see you walkin' back to me.And sometimes I wake up.'Cause I swear that I felt your touch.And emotions overcome me.And the darkness is so cold.Oh, I light a candle, watch it burn.I feel the angels come and fill this room.Oh baby, when you're gone, I miss you so much.I do the only thing I can do I pray for you.Every minute of the day.I can clearly see your face.And every minute we're apart.Oh, you know it just breaks my heart.I'm so lonely but it's okay.'Cause I know we'll be together again.Oh, I light a candle, watch it burn.I feel the angels come and fill this room.Baby when you're gone, I miss you so much.I do the only thing I can do, oh I pray for you.I pray for you.Oh, I light a candle, watch it burn.I feel the angels come and fill this room.Oh baby, when you're gone, I miss you so much.I do the only thing I can do I pray for you.I do the only thing I can do.Please hold her and protect her.Until she's back here in my arms again.Oh, and tell her, how I love her.And I'll be waiting right here forever.Amen"
"I hate to see that evening sun go down.I hate to see that evening sun go down.Cause my baby, he's gone left this town.Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today.If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today.I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way.St. Louis woman with her diamond ring.Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her.That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere.I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be.That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea.Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me"
Hey.Freedom.Yes I.Ha ha ha.Freedom.Wanna thanking you.Freedom.Is nothing in a world like a.Freedom.Ohh
"I cannot depend on gravity.You are weightless everywhere.So why would it come back to me.To listen to me stare.So what are you afraid of.There's somethin' more.It's leaving you alone.There's somethin' more.There's somethin' more.There's somethin' more.I cannot believe the attitude.That we are simply all alone.So why would it come back to you.To listen to me moan.So what are you afraid of.There's somethin' more.It's leaving you alone.There's somethin' more.There's somethin' more.There's somethin' more.I was bored.I was feelin' uninspired.It caught me.But I am sure.That besides this metal plate.I'm still the same.Same!.And I resent the attitude.That we are simply all alone.Why would it come back to you.Listen to me moan.So what are you afraid of.There's somethin' more.It's leaving you alone.There's somethin' more.What are you afraid.It's leaving you alone.It's somethin' more.It's somethin' more.Yeah.La da dee di, dee di, dee di (6x)"
As time goes on.I realize.Just what you mean.To me.And now.Now that you're near.Promise your love.That I've waited to share.And dreams.Of our moments together.Color my world with hope of loving you
"There she goes, the one that I love.The one I've been waiting for.The one I've been dreaming of.There she goes, but she'll never be mine.Wasted all of my chances.Run clean out of time.There she goes with the wind in her hair.And a smile on her face.She doesn't know what I'd give just for one moment.To be in his place.Anyway.Take a look, there she goes.Take a look, there she goes.There she goes with the wind in her hair.And a smile on her face.She doesn't know what I'd give just for one moment.To be in his place.Anyway.Take a look, there she goes.Take a look, there she goes"
"Komm mit, ich zeig dir.den Weg zu deinem Tier.Komm her, ich geb dir.das Bild zu deinem Volk.Komm rein, ich such dir.die Welt zu deinem Stein.Komm raus, ich fall dir.aus Liebe in deinen SchoÃ.Komm weiter.Komm tiefer.Komm Ã¼ber.uns alle und breite dich aus.Dein Kind ist dein Gott.Es tanzt auf deiner Seele.Es flÃ¼chtet vor dem Leben.wie Wasser auf dem heiÃen Stein.Nerv dich, such dich.find dich, lÃ¼g dich an.Komm rÃ¼ber, ich helf dir.I'm Lager zu deinem Feind.Komm runter, ich stell dir.beim TrÃ¤umen die Lichter an.Komm nÃ¤her, ich zieh dir.die Ohren zu deinem Ich.Komm reiÃ dich, zerfleisch dich.begreif dich und fÃ¼hl dich an.Komm weiter.Komm tiefer.Komm Ã¼ber.uns alle und breite dich aus.Dein Kind ist dein Gott.es tanzt auf deiner Seele.es flÃ¼cjtet vor dem Leben.wie Wasser auf dem heiÃen Stein"

"There is no time to pay my sin.And everywhere blows a firewind.I'm all alone trying to survive.It's coming back into my head.Memories of the time we had.I'm trying hard to stay alive.The sun is down, the day is done.The sky is dark, and I'm on the run.Yesterday is so far away.The wind is strong there's something wrong.But I just have to carry on.For tomorrow is a brand new day.Cause I left you without saying; ""I'll go"".Yes, I left you without letting you know.My memories is chasin' me over mountains high.And across the sea will I ever be well again.I want the strength to carry on,.What's done is done.I want the power in me to remain strong"
"Don't ask why.Just say goodbye.Don't try to understand.Time has come.For this child.To prove that he's a man.Dry your tears, stand up and pray.Hope you will see him someday.Chorus:.And there he goes.Without looking back.Just disappears in the rain.Every night.He comes to you.And blesses you in your dreams.Whispering softly.He asks for help.A cure for his disease.Taken by rage, barely sane.He was just another man.Repeat Chorus.I hate to remember.The last December.A tragic love story.Just left behind.Two souls together.During the last December.Just wanting to stay forever.Forever young.Forever young and alive....Three months later.By your door.Stood this black-dressed man.Gave the letter.Signed with blood.Written by a gun.Went his way and won't come back.Now his footsteps leave no track.Repeat Chorus.It's now or never.This is the last December.We have to grow stronger.Each and every day.We can't surrender.To the last December.We have to keep on trying.Till we find the way.Till we find the way and can go home..."
"Served was his head but still he could see far, far away.Their open plains, their open fields.Where rivers ran with bloos they lifted his body.Drenced in summerian black waters of sin.Clipped are the wings of this angel.His voice has been silenced.Stripped he has been limb from limb.The passage lies open, they are all written down word by word.their author, lord of cryptic seas.Celestian guardian of their tale and scriptures.Lead them to the fire burning.and they shall grow.When all this had been done his sight was still upon them.Neither day nor night his eyes would shut"
"What can you do.When the curtain falls.What will you do.When the curtain falls.You'll.Left, right"
"Spirit of infinity, traveller of an other age.Omitted fron the people's memory.Lost in the maze of the time.He keeps the faith, He believes in us..Evil,""I will give your blood""... Take mine!.Evil,""I will give your soul""... Just try to find mine!.Evil,""..."" don't let the old fears take part from Him.Evil,""..."" don't let the ignorance subjects us....Spirit of the light, spirit of knowledge.He frees us from the time's constraints.In order to find the the strengh and the way.To reveal at the people's conscience.The divine power who dozes in them....Evil....For love, for hate.For pleasure, for duty, Kill....Evil..."
"Shelters full out on the streets tonight.Swollen shut black eyes burning bright.Folded arms hold everything she's ever owned.Folded arms holding every broken bone.Hard to stand on broken feet below the ground.The silent face that screams a shattered sound.More to the eye than another knotted fist.Slash the lips that were once longed to be kissed.Promise keepers nothing cheaper, yeah.Promise to keep her digging deeper.One strong smile reminds looks can deceive.If you're strong enough to bleed.You're strong enough to leave.Running away again down the same short hall.The face she used to have stares from these walls.Burn the rope while tying up loose ends.Introduced to the family secret again.First step out is up then you start to walk.Take first salt by grain then by block.Promise keepers nothing cheaper.Promise to keep her digging deeper.Promise keepers nothing cheaper.I promise to keep her digging deep.If you get the guts you gotta hold em tight.You've got wings spread them out, take flight.Hard to stand on broken feet below the ground.The silent face that screams a shattered sound.Promise keepers nothing cheaper.Promise to keep her digging deeper.Promise keepers nothing cheaper.I promise to keep her digging deeper"
"Pour water on thyself.Thus shalt thou be.A creator of the sun.Charon will inhibit his entrance.The fields and dwellings of relapsing ruins.Find thou thyself in every star.Achieve thou every possibility.Listen! Heed not the siren-voice of thought.The fable of river #5.Deliverme athwart the earth.Forsaken loam of wondrous slumbers.Thee spiritual and thee fertile.A spawn of full equilibrium.But whose availeth is in this,.For hereby there comenth impair.Facillis descensus Acherni.Noctes atque dies patet.Atri ianua Charnus.Sed revocare gradun sperasque.Evadere ad aurus,.Hoc opus, hic labor est..There was not a formal sepulcher.Not one sector for the interment.Throth with thee empire of hope.All effects are welcome to Styx"
"You were an innocent child before I laid my hands on you.And all that pain that you held inside.Was just waiting to bloom in a darkened room.And you just flew right into the light and came alive.My little butterfly.Well you'd never known love and you'd never known pain.But you found out that they were just like wine and champagne.You could drink a little more, then you hurt a little less.And you get that butterfly feeling underneath your dress.And your promises will turn into lies.Then you will fly.My little butterfly.Now I'm lying here babe on your side of the bed.And I've got unclean thoughts flying through my head.And I'm thinking about love, yes I'm thinking about pain.And I'm thinking about some way that I might feel good again.Yes I'm thinking about my little butterfly"
"Lil' darlin', gotta go now.Don't know when I'll be coming back.Got my future all planned out.Got my bags packed.Things don't always turn out right.But that's just the way it goes.Before I leave you there's just a few.Things you should know.Don't talk to strangers.Don't forget to say your prayers at night.Remember God, He made you.And one day He'll make everything alright.Don't cross on the yellow.You always got to wait for a green light.Remember God, He made you.And one day He'll make everything alright.Lil' darlin', gotta go now.Don't worry, you'll be just fine.When it comes to good luck.I just know you'll always be first in line.Nobody will ever love you.As much as I do.But that doesn't mean.Other people won't love you, too.Don't talk to strangers.Don't forget to say your prayers at night.Remember God, He made you.And one day He'll make everything alright"
"I feel like I've been locked up tight.For a century of lonely nights.Waiting for someone to release me.You're lickin' your lips.And blowing kisses my way.But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away.Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby).Ooh, my body's sayin' let's go.Ooh, but my heart is sayin' no.If you wanna be with me.Baby there's a price to pay.I'm a genie in a bottle.You gotta rub me the right way.If you wanna be with me.I can make your wish come true.You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah).Gotta like what you do.(I'm a genie in a bottle baby.Gotta rub me the right way honey.I'm a genie in a bottle baby.Come come, come on and let me out).The music's fading and the lights down low.Just one more dance and then we're good to go.Waiting for someone.Who needs me.Hormones racing at the speed of light.But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight.Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby).Ooh, my body's sayin' let's go.Ooh, but my heart is sayin' no (but my heart is sayin' no).If you wanna be with me.Baby there's a price to pay.I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle).You gotta rub me the right way.If you wanna be with me (Oh).I can make your wish come true (Your wish come true oh).Just come and set me free baby.And I'll be with you.(I'm a genie in a bottle baby.Gotta rub me the right way honey.I'm a genie in a bottle baby.Come come, come on and let me out).I'm a genie in a bottle baby.Gotta rub me the right way honey.(If you wanna be with me).I'm a genie in a bottle baby.Come come, come on and let me out.Ooh, my body's sayin' lets go.Ooh, but my heart is sayin' no.If you wanna be with me.Baby there's a price to pay.I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle).You gotta rub me the right way.If you wanna be with me.I can make your wish come true.Just come and set me free, baby.And I'll be with you.If you wanna be with me.Baby there's a price to pay.I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle baby).You gotta rub me the right way.If you wanna be with me (If you wanna be with me).I can make your wish come true.Just come and set me free baby.And I'll be with you.I'm a genie in a bottle baby.Come come, come on and let me out"
I know why I'm intrigued.You keep surprisin' me.Somewhere between the lines.There's no way to define.Every move you make.Always never the same.Call me mesmerized.Somewhat hypnotized.Somehow in conversation.I'm lost in sweet temptation.Every word you say.Always never the same.I can't count the ways.You take my breathe away.Always never the same.I can't count the ways.You take my breathe away.Always never the same.Always never the same.Always never the same
Woke up lyin' on the floor.Can't recall the night before.Oh another day.Outside it's cold and damp.Unemployment cheque is spent.Yeah another day.Some people never know.You can't just let it go.Or try and work it out some other way.Some people never learn.My life ain't their concern.And nothing's gonna change come what may.Had a job but it fell through.Landlord says the rent is due.Oh another day.They say the best in life is free.But if you don't pay then you don't eat.Oh another day.I guess I'll never know.You can't just let it go.Or try to work it out some other way.Some people never learn.Their life ain't my concern.Ain't nothin' gonna change come what may.Grass looks greener on the other side.But I can't get there my hands are tied.And if I do don't be surprised.Oh gotta figure it out another day
Insane.I feel ashamed when the morning comes.And I hate to breathe.Guilty.No doubt I am.Please tell me how to come clean again.Spaceship.Go fuck the stars.When the night falls down they shine on me.Have you ever felt this way.Like you are the worst mankind on the planet earth.Don't even ask why I'm standing here.I found a piece of me.It is still left in you.It's very cheap but cute emotion.I wish you were here.[Chorus].'Cause I found the way to live with that.I'm not going anywhere.I thought you'd only make me weak.That's wrong.I knew it all and you knew it all.That it's never gonna work.To wait for someone who could stop this rain.It just rains.Watching.The same old dream.A mailing car runs over me.Have you ever felt this way.Like you are the most useless on the planet earth.Don't even ask why I'm standing here.I found the shiners of my own.A fantasy Good memories.It's very cheap but cute emotion.I with you were here.[Chorus].It just rains.Maybe there's no one who is perfect.But who wants to be anyway.Maybe there's no one who is all clean.But who wants to be anyway.[Chorus]
"Brutal orgy on flesh.A carnal feast for our lord.Feel your life float away.As I revel in your blood.Maggots crawl in your flesh.Your life is ending here.Terribly maiming your corpse.Rotting pieces here and there.The loss of your life is now a fact.Dead, eternal hell, awaits.Rotting soul now dies.Innocent soul dismembered.A trophy to our lord.Enter the dark regions.And suffer a thousand death's.You pray for eternal life.But your cries are denied.As you pray to your God.I spit on your grave.Slaughter remains.Enter my ways.Descend to hell.llewd yllanrete ll'eW.Like the rest you all will die.Cast into the pits of hell"

"Living in dreams, day dreaming.Not in good shape for a life.Can't remember, why I like this feeling.Falling, falling on knives.Words can boost, words can break.Smiling sins can do no wrong.Say something good, if you speak.Good news never last too long.Forget the time too often.And I don't care to get some sleep.It's the skull I aim to soften.From there inside of you I'll creep.What did I expect to find.Dreams are not the same as life.More than the world inside my mind.Dreams empty into my life.What did I expect to find.Dreams are not the same as life.More than the world inside my mind.Dreams empty into my life.Heavy lids closing my eyes.Dreaming of falling asleep again.Blacken my visions of my.Life coming to a bitter end.Now surrounded all by strangers.Strangers I call friends.Help the species help to endanger.Darkness falling to play pretend.Forget the time too often.Inside your skull I aim to creep.See the soft spot in the skull.What did I expect to find.Dreams are not the same as life.More than the world inside my mind.Dreams empty into my life.What did I expect to find.Dreams are not the same as life.More than the world inside my mind.Dreams empty into my life.Heavy lids closing my eyes.Dreaming of falling asleep again.Blacken my visions of my.Life coming to a bitter end.Heavy lids killing my eyes.Dreaming of death in my sleep again.Blacken my visions of my.Life coming to an end"

"Music is the key to fall in love.Music is the answer of the world.Music is the power to survive when I feel down.Even if I'm wasting all my time.Trying to get your face out of my mind.The summer takes you back into my heart, into my soul.Remember the time when we were spending afternoons.Making love we used to fly on the sun.Recall the days we broke the rules we jumped the wall.You know that I would never lose your love.I'm feeling like a dancing around the world.Open my heart and keep on trying to find your love.I, I can see this passion drift apart.I thought that I would never miss your love.The summer is crazy ah ha.La la la la.The summer is crazy ah ha.La la la la.The summer is crazy tonight [Repeat x3].La la la la.I keep on thinking how you did me wrong.My love was true and I will never let it go.I need to find a way to save my heart.Cause I know that I will never have your love.The summer is crazy"
"Ayo, this song is dedicated to all the happy people.All the happy people who have real nice lives.And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck.I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net.Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck.I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check.I'm about to burst this Tec at somebody to reverse this debt.Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged.Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged.And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper.I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer.Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders.These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers.We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us.Along with the small fries and average half-pinters.But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas.Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us.Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless.When snakes slither in the grass spineless.That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill.That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal.That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here.Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear.That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill.That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal.That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here.Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear.My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams.I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings.I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished.Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished.And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay.And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day.But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play.Cause when we die we know we all goin' the same way.Cause it's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan.When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan.I'm comfortable and roomy in a 6.But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics.Who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day.And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today.My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play.Live half a life and throw the rest away.That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill.That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal.That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here.Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear.That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill.That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal.That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here.Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear.There's people that love me and people that hate me.But it's the evil that made me this backstabbin', deceitful and shady.I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame.If it means I end up burnin' in hell, scorchin' in flames.If it means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name.This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain.Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom.I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got em.I'm screaming like them two cops when 2Pac shot em.Holding 2 Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on em.My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on em.And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on em.And while you flaunt em I could be takin' em to shops to pawn em.I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want em?.Cause I ain't never went gold off one song.I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn.That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill.That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal.That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here.Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear.That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill.That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal.That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here.Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear"

"I'm trying to control myself.So please don't stand in my way.I've waited for the longest time.This is what I wanted in my way.Move over, move over.There's a climax coming in my way.Move over, move over.There's a climax coming in my way.I don't like you, don't compromise.Shattered by your weakness.Shattered by your smile.And I'm not very fond of you, and your lies.Shattered by your weaknesses.Shattered by your smile.All the kids are going back to school.The summer's over it's the golden rule.And now I'm coming out to play.So please don't stand in my way.And all the things that seemed once to be.So important to me.Seem so trivial now that I can see.Move over, move over.There's a climax coming my way.Move over, move over.There's a climax coming my way.I don't like you, don't compromise.Shattered by your weakness.Shattered by your smile.And I'm not very fond of you, and your lies.Shattered by your weaknesses.Shattered by your smile.Shattered by your weaknesses.Shattered by your smile.Shattered by your weaknesses.I was Shattered by your smile.Shattered by your weaknesses.I was Shattered by your smile.Please don't stand in my way"
I got High John in my pocket.And mud in my shoes.Walked all the way from Mississippi.Just to spread the news.Don't care for idle conversation.I'm not your girl about town.But when it comes to make music.I run the voodoo down.And here in this quiet place I own.Worlds are born.The night of my conception.The star were fixed.Conjure woman told my mother.She's gonna run and twist.Don't have to worry 'bout her learning.She's gonna get around.And when it comes to traveling.She'll run the voodoo down.Here in this quiet place we own.We're born.Destiny is my deliverance.I walk this road alone.I take my pleasure in remembering.I'm just a rolling stone.And I don't mind some company.If you want to stay around.But when it comes to my loving.I run the voodoo down.And here in this quiet place I own.Worlds are born
"I met my love hillary at the local distillery..She was leaning so languidly, on the window sillery..And I was glued to my seat as I gazed at her feat.Hey, hey, hillary. hey, hey, hillary..My heart was hi-jacked. my lips were gobsmacked..Her hair was shimmering. my brain was simmering..Then my blood began to boil. my desire would not be foiled..Hey, hey, hillary. hey, hey, hillary..Hey, hey, hillary. hey, hey, hillary..Right then and there I made a vow..I'm gonna make her mine somehow..Hey, hey, hillary. hey, hey, hillary..My head was spinning like a top, as I offered her a cough drop..And as she placed it on her tongue,.My stomach did a flip-flop..When I invited her to dance,.That was the start of our romance..Hey, hey, hillary. hey, hey, hillary..And though she's got her share of quirks..Living with her has got it's perks..Hey, hey, hillary. hey, hey, hillary..Now we live the way we do, in our cozy little igloo..Feasting on corn flakes, marzipan and hot cakes..And when she leans against the sink, she's my saucy little sausage link..Hey, hey, hillary, hey, hey, hillary..And though it may sound strange to say..I thank my God everyday..Hey, hey, hillary. hey, hey, hillary..Hey, hey, hillary"
Oh it's so easy.When parts take over.My conversation.Is nothing more than lies.You're just the viewer.So cold and distant.I've no intentions.Of saying I love you.My conversation.We are not gods.We are not men.We are not making claims.We are only boys.You are not strong.You are not force.You are not regular.You are just wrong.There are no faces.This is my complex.You are my picture.I call you 'mirrors'.These are not my tears.Not my reflection.Am I a photo?.I can't remember.My conversation
"White boy in town.Big black, blue sound.Night Club, I paid in.I got a stamp on my skin..Main attraction nearly dead on his feet.Black man rhythm with a white boy beat.They got him on milk and alcohol..They got him on milk and alcohol..Stay put, I wanna go.Hard work, bad show.More liquor don't help.He's gonna die, breaks my heart..I decided that eventually.This ain't doin' a thing for me.They got him on milk and alcohol..They got him on milk and alcohol..They got him on milk and alcohol..They got him on milk and alcohol..They got him on milk and alcohol..They got him on milk and alcohol..Got up, I walked out.To the car, started up.Feel bad, sad night.Never saw a red light..Sirens were screaming all around.I pulled on over and I shut her down.The black cop gave me a shove with his gun.Sit up against the wall and don't make a run."
Walking down this well known street.turning 'round for ladies feet.like you did so many years ago.sitting in that street cafe.where you had your cup of tea.come on boy don't get sentimental now.everything changed but you didn't move on.and the only fact is.that you're fifteen years older now.No use to turn out the lights.you feel so depressed inside.when you think of your wasted years at night.Standing in your discotheque.look since hours straight ahead.play the part of some young and lonesome star.introverted more and more.waiting for a small hello.people next to you they seem so far.but deep inside you made love to the world.'cause your imagination.was bigger than reality.No use to turn out....When you came into that town.you found everything so fine.all your projects shall be realized.but your day-dreams strangled you.kept you from what you had to do.and life went on while you were paralysed.heaven knows you would give all you have.for the change to go back to those days for a new beginning.No use to turn out....Walking down....Better you leave the places of your past.'cause dreamers love cities and citie hate dreamers.No use to turn out...
When your little world has fallen apart.You'll be living on Beacon Street.In a flat above a laundry.It's warm and forgiving on Beacon Street.Hundreds of paperback novels adorning your shelves.Piles of CDs that are eager to please.Still asserting themselves.There's something in the morning light.That is muted and soft down on Beacon Street.Then a bar or two of classical music.Will waft through the air.Newspaper adverts will usher the future your way.Indian teas and then take-out Chinese.At the end of the day.Shadows on furniture cast by the light of the moon.You've got a fridge full of food.You won't need to go anywhere soon.When it's time to start again.They will welcome you in down on Beacon Street.Everybody needs a moment or two.Now and then on their own
Welcome to the TERRORAISE.The movies weren't enough.You got sick of all the fakes -.And now you want some blood.Pick up your hero place your bets -.I wonder who will die.TERRORAISE - life is so cheap.TERRORAISE - you must stay on your feet.Smell the sweat taste of blood - in your movie seat.Think of what the future holds -.When death is the retreat.Kids will grow up fat on violence -.Murder is the norm.And you'll be in the picture-show.Like just another pawn.TERRORAISE
"Se viene la sera.compagno non avrai,.da solo farai la tua strada....E allora la prima sar la faina,.verr per portarti paura..Se non la fuggirai,.sorella ti sar,.lei che davvero conosce.l'ordine segreto che il fiume conduce,.per il tuo passo il sentiero sicuro..Se viene la sera.compagno non avrai,.da solo farai la tua strada....Sar solo allora che da te verr il lupo,.verr per portarti paura..Se non lo fuggirai.fratello ti sar,.lui che davvero conosce.il passo segreto che il monte ferisce,.per il tuo capo il riparo sicuro..Seguendo la via.che va verso il lago,.tu troverai la sorgente,.ritroverai la collina dei giochi,.e l tu deponi il tuo cuore."
I can hear your soul crying.Listen to your spirit sighing.I can feel your desperation.Emotional deprivation.Let yourself go.Let yourself go.Let your feelings show.Picking up the conversations.Deep in your imagination.Tune in to the lonely voices.Talking of their only choices.Let yourself go.Let yourself go.Let your spirit grow.Step out of your cage and onto the stage.It's time to start playing your part.Freedom awaits.Open the gates.Open your mind.Freedom's a state.I can taste the tears falling.The bitterness that's inside you calling.Yearning for a liberation.Emotional emancipation.Let yourself go.Let yourself go.Let your senses overflow.Step out of your cage and onto the stage.It's time to start playing your part.Freedom awaits.Open the gates.Open your mind.Freedom's a state
"At the edge of the world is a big tin wall.Put it there when I was a child.Trying to define - explain - infinity.Chorus.At the edge of the world.At the edge of the world.At the edge of the world love is dangerous.Nowhere to turn - front, side, back, around.Nowhere to fall but into the arms of infinity.At the edge of the world.At the edge of the world.Understand what you can not see.Won't you please take a picture for me?.Alone on the edge I am wandering.Trying to see over the side.Tell me, will I see you there.Dangling and reaching your hand to me?.At the edge of the world.At the edge of the world.At the edge of the world.At the edge of the world"
"We must complete the trip, try not to lose your grip.No sight of solid ground and never look straight down.Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper.Your claustrophobic brain sucking you down the drain.The walls are closing in, the air is getting thin.The elevator broke, it went right through the floor.It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go.We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in.We're helpless, panic grows, down and down and down we go.Daylight is at an end, you'll never see again.You'll soon embrace the sight, this cold eternal light.The elevator broke, it went right through the floor.It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go.We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in.Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go.The elevator broke, it went right through the floor.It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go.We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in.Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go.The elevator broke, it went right through the floor.It left a burning hole, down and down and down we go.We're in a deadly spin, hating this spin we're in.Our helpless panic grows, down and down and down we go"
True you ride the finest horse.I've ever seen.Standing sixteen one or two.With eyes wide and green.You ride the horse so well.Hands light to the touch.I could never go with you.No matter how I wanted to.Ride on.See you.I could never go with you.No matter how I wanted to.Ride on.See you.I could never go with you.No matter how I wanted to.When you ride into the night.Without out a trace behind.Run your claw along my gush.One last time.I turn to face an empty space.Where you used to lie.And look for the spark that lights the night.Through the teardrop in my eye.Ride on.See you.I could never go with you.No matter how I wanted to.Ride on.See you.I could never go with you.No matter how I wanted to

"Well I'm up there beside the magic man.And he laid some tricks for me.He said you do need help my friend.I whispered, obviously.He laid a spread of Jacks and Queens.And he begged me take my pick.But every face that had your face.I cried out, I am sick.[Chorus].Sick of hauling your love around.Want to run my train alone.But the engine tracks straight through your heart.And weighs me like a stone.Oh it's a hard love to love you it takes up all my time.Having you so familiar like past lives and nursery rhymes.So I gave away the pictures and your golden ring.And the phone calls you sent me and the silver birds that sing.Then the man he told me something that really brought me down.Your things were blown away it's true but you were still in town.[Chorus].The magician left a message, it flashes when I hide.Accept the chains of loving,.Accept the rails remove yourself from her side.Do without her love.As I lay back in the speeding train, I keep it by my side.I could mail a letter to you but I still have my pride"
"Too much like everybody else.You let me fall to my knees again.We can't pretend it's all right.To make it through another night.All this is happening too fast.She said she knew it wouldn't last.And why should anything change?.Because you decide to remain.We're too late.We took too long.Yeah, I thought that we could have had it all.We're too late.We took too long.Yeah, I thought that we could have had it all.So much like everybody else.I let you fall at my feet again.Well let's pretend it's all right.And make it through another night.I'm not like anybody else.So please don't put me on a shelf, no, no.And why should anything change?.Because you decide to remain.We're too late.We took too long.Yeah, I thought that we could have had it all.We're too late.We took too long.Yeah, I thought that we could have had it all"
"The big problem is the main attraction.Dominoes are falling in a chain reaction.The scraping subject ruled by fear told me.""whiskey life's better than beer"".The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final.And nobody gets a reprieve.And everyway this title if you hang around.You're going to get well.I can't prepare for death any more than I already have.All you can do now is watch the shelves.The game looks easy that's why it sells.Frustrated fireworks inside your head.Are going to stand and deliver talk instead.The method acting that pays my bills.Keeps the fat man pheening in beverly hills.I got a heavy metal mouth in hilltop city.And I get my check from the trash treasury.Cos I took my own insides out.It don't matter cos I had no sex life.All I want to do now is eject my ex wife.I've seen the movie and I know what happens.It's a christmas time.And the needles on the tree.A skinny santa is bringing something to me.His voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred.And I only understand every other word.""open your parachute and grab your gun.Falling down like an omen, my setting sun.Read the part and we turn out fine.It's a hell of a role if you can bring it alive"".But I don't care if I fuck up.I'm going on a date with a rich white lady.Ain't life great?.Give me one good reason not to do it.This is a place where time reverses.Dead men talk to all the pretty nurses.Instruments shine on a silver train.Don't let me be carried away.Don't let me be carried away.Don't let me be carried away"
"If I had a dollar.For every time.You broke my heart,.Messed up my mind.Well I'd be the richest man.I'd be the richest man....in the world.If bad times paid interest.I'd have you to thank.I'd be driving a new car,.Have money in the bank.I'd be the richest man.I'd be the richest man....in the world.Baby..money can't buy love.The kind I dream of is so hard to find.For a good womans touch in the morning when I rise.Well baby I'd give up every single dime.Money cant buy love.The kind I dream of is so hard to find.For a good woman's touch in the mrning when I rise.Baby I'd give up every single dime.If teardrops were diamonds from the african mines.If heartaches were silver.My whole life would shine.And I'd be the richest man.I'd be the richest man....in the world.Baby."

I found my thrill on blueberry hill.On blueberry hill where i found you.The moon stood still on blueberry hill.And lingered till my dreams came true.The wind in the willow played.Love's sweet melody.But all of those vows we made.Were never to be.Tho' we're apart you're part of me still.For you were my thrill on blueberry hill.The wind in the willow played.Love's sweet melody.But all of those vows we made.Were never to be.Tho' we're apart you're part of me still.For you were my thrill on blueberry hill
Another Sunday match again.Another Merseyside clash again.It's the 36th this season.By my calculations.That's when I made the decision.To stay in the lower divisions.Travelling from town to town.Hopping round from ground to ground.For the character and determination.In the face of bankruptcy.For the passion and dedication.Despite the threat of the Vauxhall League.And the stands may be empty.And the bank account too.But there's something in my stomach.Says they'll always pull through.That's when I made the decision.To stay in the lower divisions.Travelling from town to town.Hopping round from ground to ground

"The busy streets.And the even busier.Patrons and vehicles.Argue my elusive steps.Through the blur of urgency.Here, I'm always on my toes.Until an abrupt blond door.Stowing a porcelain blond girl.Knock me right onto my back.And for a moment we're alone.And we both know that we're trapped.If morning never brings.Salvation for either one of us.Leave me and save yourself.I'll only slow you down.Breathe in slowly.Are you listening?.On this muted block.Everything is paused.You glow, blinding.Breaches my pupils.I taste your skin, I see our kids.I manage to siphon.Some breath from out my gut.Tell you to take my hand and run.I'll be waiting for you to come home.Extra, extra read all about it.A corporate head's been murdered!.His secretary found him.Scandal, slander.Catch all the gossip.From what I hear.The chief executive deserved it.Let's leave tonight at dusk.When the lights shine bright.Miles of cracked, crooked paths.Lit by buzzing filament.And neon glass.If morning never brings salvation.Leave me and save yourself.I'll always love you"
"Born to suffer, through a lifetime of darkness.Controlled by fear, held deep within your mind.As your mind reaches a distant point.Your soul beyond all pain.You shall realize all that has occurred.Were illusions formed from within your brain.You now know the truth, your mind is now set free.You have broken the chains that enslave all of humanity.Perceiving, life's reality.An insight to man's destiny.A coherent existence, comprehension you cannot deny.A meaningless persistence, confirmation you cannot defy.We follow without thinking, as our life passes us by.This newly acquired knowledge, clarified as we die.In this kingdom of the mindless.We are born to suffer"
"Here you stand seething with guilt.Silence only justifies this act of cowardice.Look the stapled on your face cries out for forgiveness.The one thing that I cannot give.Did you ever see that one person.And the way they do these things?.And it hurts you so much.It's like choking, choking.I can give you freedom from your guilt.With a flick of my wrist onto yours.I can give you peace of mind with a forced smile.I can give you death with the look upon my face.This is your freedom in a life of fallacy.With no last kiss and no regrets, you don't deserve goodbye.This is your freedom in a life of fallacy.With no last kiss and no good bye.Here you stand seething with guilt.Silence only justifies this act of cowardice.With a short story, the one you add to daily, you are the tragic loss.No story book ending for this fairy tale of you.Just the one composed with blood taken from your head.That you hold in your lifeless hand.Cry for you, shed tears, mourn, wish the end.Cry for you, shed tears, mourn, wish the end.Mourn, wish the end, mourn, wish the end.Mourn, wish the end.Did you ever look? Did you ever see that one person.And the subtle way that they do these things?.And it hurts so much.So much like choking down the embers of a great blaze.It's a moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions.And to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds.You let this one person come down in most perfect moment.And it breaks my heart to know the only reason, you are here now.Is a reminder of what I'll never have, I'll never have, I'll never.Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in.Standing so close knowing that it kills me to breathe you in.But this table for one has become bearable.I now take comfort in this, and for this, I cherish you.Did you ever look? Did you ever see that one person.And the subtle way that they do these things?.And it hurts so much.So much like choking down the embers of a great blaze.It's that moment when your eyes seem to spread aspersions.And to scream confessions at the insipid sky parting clouds.You let this one person come down, come down.I cherish you, I cherish you.Just say you would do the same for me.Just say you would do the same for me.Just say you would do the same.Just say you would do the same for me.For as much as I love Autumn, I'm giving myself to Ashes"
"Whoa yeah!.She came walking in like a vision, everybody's school boy dream.Ooh yeah, she could be my teacher, ooh yeah, she could be my queen.Me and the boys, we stopped talking, she came walking through.And one by one the subject got around, yeah, got around to you, thank god.I've got no secrets, I've got no clue.And all I really wanna do, is get next to you.You know what the world's about, and I'll be your dirty boy.Well your clothes are made by designers, you only wear the best perfume.You're so cold and chique, yeah, you're so unique.But when it comes to me, don't think that you're immune, no.I've got no answers, I've got no doubt.I know you wanna show me baby, what the world's about.Don't treat me like I broke your toy, and I'll be your dirty boy.(solo).I've got no secrets, I've got no clue.And all I really wanna do, is get next to you.You know what the world's about, and I'll be your dirty boy.I've got no answers, I've got no doubt.I know you wanna show me babe, what the world's about.Don't treat me like I broke your toy, and I'll be.Be your dirty boy, be your dirty boy, I wanna be your dirty boy, ooh yeah.I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be your dirty boy, be your dirty boy, yeah.I wanna be your dirty boy, be your dirty boy..."
"Electric line, racing time.Fire down the wall.Spinning around, the killing ground.It makes you look so small.Henna years, the stinging tears.Flesh on the railway track.The screaming queen on the TV screen.Is never coming back.Suffer no more.Step inside and listen.Listen to my pillbox tales.Your special days, your winning ways.You're living out the past.You're lying lies and tying ties.And running much too fast.But you feel so sick.If you run too quick and wishing every day.Wishing you were all along.Wishing you were years away.Suffer no more.Step inside and listen.Listen to my pillbox tales.Listen to my.Listen to my pillbox tales.Electric line, racing time.Fire down the wall.Spinning around, this killing ground.It makes you look so small.The henna years, the stinging tears.Flesh on the railway track.Jamming queen on the TV screen.Is never coming back.Suffer no more.Step inside and listen.Listen to my pillbox tales.Step inside and listen to my.Step inside and listen to my.Step inside and listen to my pillbox tales"
"walking trough theh unknown woods.the angels fell aslee (That night).but my steps were firm and strong.(as they were) in the light of day.i held my eyes straight in the dark.to scare the beasts that cross my way.there'll never be a winding road.that stops my quest and ends my prayers.ref: i know until the judgement day.when all the seas gonde dry.there will never be another one.who's lonelier than i.i saw (the) infoerno and (the) paradise.i saw the beast and heard its lies.i heard the sirens sing their songs.i still don't know my way.i wandered as i always did.a shere of darkness followed me.as i saw a clearing light.that marked the end of all (my journeys).ref.and as i entered the placeof light.a bird appeared before my eyes.and it twittered brightly into my ear.""Your aim is death, your grave stands here!"".so i lie down in the grassrelax my arms my feet my heart.the burdens of my quests are one.now i know where i belong!.now i know my way"

Sometimes I feel.That we've been herded like sheep.We've been led out like lambs to the slaughter.And empty souls.Have kept the downtrodden down.And took the best and left us the fodder.Still in my heart.I feel such purpose.A reason for being alive.And I want to know.I want to know.Sometimes it seems.There was meant to be more.Than this rush and this battle to living.And there's the times.We've all tasted the space.That you know when we feel that we're giving.So take some time.To think about this.I'm blinded now.I'd like to see.And I want to know.I want to know.I want to see through all the barriers.That were created before I was born.Were they put out there just to guide me.Or keep the weak from becoming strong.I want to know.I want to know.Still in my heart.I feel such purpose.A reason for being alive.And I want to know.Sometimes I fear.That all men are asleep.Must we shout to awake those that slumber?

"It's a plentiful day.Holding us together this way.The only things real to us are the words.We know we can have it all.Upon the heads of our youthful charms.But as far as I can see, all you see.Emotions flooding you to me.I touch, you're never there.I call, but we never seem to reach that far.Each time we fall, I call.You're a girl of an age.Who isn't touched by anyone.Out of reach, out of disbelief.You're a girl of an age.It's a plentiful day.Holding us together this way.The only things real to us are the words.Words are fine, each one we say.At the time we fall, to each others arms.But as far as I can see, all you see.Emotions flooding you to me.We belong to an age of love"

"From his youth, he sees inside,.A slow parades of storms.Lessons learned from fear are nothin' to lose.The voice remeins it sounds the same.Even from so far.And he feels much better.From the sky hear the call.Faces and colors they change I fade my believin'.When I'm lost in the shadows to roam.The voice of Eujena can send me home.Draw this bridge and sail away.The boy becomes a man.To fight his own battles and realize some dreams.Beacon light shine all around.Guides the sheep to shore.And he feels much better.In the light safe he goes.Faces and colors they change I fade from believin'.I feel lost in the shadows alone.With no ending.Faces and colors they've changed.Through all that I've known.But thevoice of Eujena can send me home"
"I'm having myself a time.I mean I'm having what I want.Wanting what I have.Doing what I like.And liking what I do.And I'm having myself a time.I never could save a dime.And so I'm living like a lord.Acting like, a loon.Lying in the sun.And sighing in the moon.And I'm having myself a lime.When I hum songs.They're all dumb songs.Without reason nor rhyme.But I'm certainly in my prime.I friend I'm happy as a bird, flying up above.Walk a little love and get a little love.And I'm having myself a time.But I'm certainly in my prime.I mean I'm happy as a bird, flying up above.Walk a little love and get a little love.And I'm having myself a time"
He doesn't want your love.But he can't say goodbye.He's beggin' you to stay.But he can't tell you why.You finally made your move.Your hand is on the door.You know the rest is hard.You've been this far before.Don't look back now.He's gonna see you cryin'.You'll turn around.It happens everytime.That look will always break you down.Don't look back now.You pick your suitcase up.You hear him call your name.You'd give your soul to him.If things could be the same.You stop and close your eyes.You grab some memories.You think of better days.But that's all history.Don't look back now.He's gonna see you cryin'.You'll turn around.It happens everytime.That look will always break you down.Don't look back now
"I didn't see it coming.I just thought that you were friendly.But here we are passionately embraced.I suppose it's kind of funny.But it's also kind of scary.That your kiss brought back a feeling I'd erased.When you said that you were lonely.And I said I thought you would be.Then you took me to a darker holy place.Then I said I liked to kiss you.And you said you loved to kiss me.Then kissed the sweetest kiss I'll ever taste.Cause I've known you for an hour.But you're growing like a flower in me.I've known you for a lifetime.Or we're soul mates from a past life.Daisy.It's all mixed with indecision.And a painful soulful spilling.Of everything I've ever felt or known.And you know that they're all looking.So you kiss me even harder.Then hold me and I just feel right at home.Your touch is soft and tender.So I raise my flag surrender.Then say I feel you staring at my soul.And it makes them all feel awkward.But our time here's more important.So we sink into our closed eyed painful hole.I'm scared of what will happen.So I kiss you, say I'll call you.Then I tell you so much I don't understand.Then you kiss me with an answer.And my question seems invalid.And I go to bed with daisies in my hand.I call you there's no answer.But I know I have to see you.So I call and call and call and call again.But you never get my message.Or you choose not to return it.Because you shouldn't, needn't, wouldn't or just can't.I'm lonely and I love you.For the moment that is what's true in me.I've known you now forever.Joined at the soul together.Daisy.There'll be no way to avoid you.When I see you in the movies.And I realize right now you're not here with me.If I'll see you in my lifetime.If again I'll feel you kiss me.I suppose that I'll just have to wait and see.But for now I'll just be grateful.To be touched by such an angel.And put it down as life experience.That my muse is just a daisy.With the most beautiful nature.Will one day fall back in my flower bed.And I know you said you love me.And that's the only memory left for me.Cause I need you more than ever.Joined at the soul together.Daisy"

Been going on for fucking years now.And punks we're going to stay.What you see is how it is.We'll never sell out no way.[Chorus].We'll never sell out.Is what I say.We'll never sell out no way.I don't give a fuck about you say.I do things my own way.Because that's the way i've always been.And the way it's gonna stay.[Chorus].We'll never sell out.Is what I say.We'll never sell out no way.All those cunts that slagged us off.Are just a bunch of fucking twats.From Big John to Conflict too.Disappeared up their own arse.[Chorus].We'll never sell out.Is what I say.We'll never sell out no way
"Such a picture of loveliness.Didn't you notice the resemblance?.Doesn't it look like she could speak?.Those eyes I tried to capture.They are lost to me now forever.They smile for someone else.Funny, how looks can be deceiving.But she`s not easily.Painted from memory.You`d think that I would know by now.Those eyes I tried to capture.They are lost to me now forever.They smile for someone else.And so this had to be.Painted from memory.She is gone, and I must accept it.She is lost to me now.But I can`t look away just yet though.She smiles for someone else.And so this had to be.Painted from memory.Funny, now I can see.How looks can be deceiving.And so this had to be.Painted from memory.Funny, now I can see.How looks can be deceiving"

Vanochtend toen je wegreed.Keek ik je na.En je verdween in een wolk.Van een regenboog zo blauw.Zo groen.Zo geel.Zo rood.Ik wens je veel sterkte.In de jungle.Pas op voor het donker.In de jungle.Pas toen je weg was.Dacht ik na.En keek of ik mijn verstand.Niet verloren had.Ik vond het in een la.Ik was bang.Dat je het meenam.Naar de jungle.Misschien had je het nodig.In de jungle.Weet je nog.Die droom die ik vannacht had.Of was het werkelijkheid.Dat jij hier in mijn armen lag.Zacht als een weekdier.Zacht als een spons.Waren je lippen p mijn mond.Mijn armen op jouw hals.Hard op de grond.Vannacht namen wij een voorproef.Op de jungle.Alles wild en warm.In de jungle.Geen schaamte.Laat je gaan.In de jungle.Ik kom je wel weer tegen.In de jungle.In de jungle
"Sixty feet out of reach, hammer down every time.And we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on.Don't fuck with the stroker, it's 60 over.And I know that we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on.Power down in the hole,.and you was smokin' on the shoulder.Sucked you up like a leech.and now you're limpin' like a Duster.While we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on.Like a D/Class gasser, four-speed suicide.We was gittin' it on, gittin' it on.Dominatin' the modified, force-fed power grind.And we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on.Power down in the hole.and you was smokin' on the shoulder.Sucked you up like a leaech.and now yo're limpin' like a Duster.While we was gittin' it on, gittin' it on...Gittin' it on, Gittin' it on.Got the heavies, Got the heavies"

Give it to me!.Give it here! c'mon!.C'mon! Give it to me!.Uh! Put your weight on it"
"I asked myself what the chances could be.That I would live to age seventy-three.We're livin' in Ground Zero.Talk to the TV and the TV talks back.It says, ""Buddy better face the fact.You're living in Ground Zero"".Chorus:.Livin' in Ground Zero.The future has begun.Livin' in Ground Zero.The future has begun.Ground Zero.Ground Zero.Go to the doctor feeling paranoid.He says, ""Buddy better face it boy.You're livin' in Ground Zero"".I want to live to be a family man.I want to live without fear.Chorus.I asked myself what the chances could be.That I would live to age seventy-three.We're livin' in Ground Zero.Chorus"
"Sitting on a sofa, chewing gum and watcing a movie.Got no things to do but sit and chew, and I'm feeling groovy.All right, chill out, switch off the telephone.Come on, cut out, don't you see I'm stoned.Prove me, honey, give me an argument.That the weed I'm smoking ain't no heaven sent.Peeling a potato in the kitchen, gotta say that it's the last one.Smiling at the neighbours that are knocking on my door.And saying 'what fun'.All right, chill out, switch off the telephone.Come on, cut out, don't you see I'm stoned.Prove me, honey, give me an argument.That the weed I'm smoking ain't no heaven sent.Sitting on a sofa, chewing gum and watcing a movie.Got no things to do but sit and chew, and I'm feeling groovy.They say I'm gonna end up in a funny farm.Although I think that kind of place does have it's charm.You'd better roll a joint and feel it's getting, getting warm.All right, chill out, switch off the telephone.Come on, cut out, don't you see I'm stoned.Prove me, honey, give me an argument.That the weed I'm smoking ain't no heaven sent"
The Feeling of understanding is very rare.For someone like me it's hard to find.Somebody to care.She's got a way about her.Changes everything.She's got a way about her.She's my sweet lil' thing.Making love with her indie rock.Playing on the stereo.Holding hands going down the road.When she drives me home.She's got a magic about her.Makes me want to sing.She's got a magic about her.She's my sweet lil' thing.Spent the day lying in her bed.My nose against hers.Later we went for a drive.Didn't know where we were.Man I never felt so alive.Nobody gets the girl.But baby I do.Nobody gets me either.But she sees through.She's got a glow around her.Shines on everything.She's got a glow around her.She's my sweet lil' thing
"Gentle you were in your first presence.Hazel to brown eyes embraced innocence.We dressed each other in colors of intrigue.First words to each other sang comfort's melody.Childlike was your first gracious allurement.Her offering hands touched mine in content.Laughter filled the air illuminated portraits.Silence was the moment that gave dawn to this kiss.Elation shined off our vivid souls, in waves of euphoria.Emotions were thrown. sunshine's fire in embodied eyes, so.Full of truth and when we held! we held tight..Lifeless! I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.Lifeless! I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.Lifeless! I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.Lifeless! I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.I felt her image sorrowed face nods to the ground.Grey clouds suffering was her sound.She screamed deep, but desire claimed her collapse.Gone to nothing then her frigid mask.Her own remorse, her lifeless companion, tongue stained.In duplicity's song, gentle hands stifle, I perishing suffering.This isn't her! this could never be her.Diminishing, forsaken all, I.Offering entirety, left empty to cry.She cried with me! Danced with me and kissed me.She was filthy in lies, gentle, always.Lifeless! I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.Lifeless! I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.Lifeless! I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.Lifeless! I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.Watch me rise.I say you left me, I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.I say you left me, I say you left me, I say you left me lifeless.Lifeless! Lifeless! Lifeless! Lifeless! I say you left me"
