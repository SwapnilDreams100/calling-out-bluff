"When all this revolution is over, he sits down on a highly polished floor while his dizziness fades away. It is an empty modern hallway and the dreamdoll saleslady sits at the reception desk. Without prompting she goes into her rap: ""This is the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging, those you are about to see are all in for servicing, except for a small quantity of our new product, in the second gallery. It is all the stock required to cover the existing arrangements of the enterprise. Different batches are distributed to area operators, and there are plenty of opportunities for the large investor. They stretch from the costly care-conditioned to the most reasonable mal-nutritioned. We find here that everyone's looks become them. Except for the low market mal-nutritioned, each is provided with a guarantee for a successful birth and trouble free infancy. There is however only a small amount of variable choice potential - not too far from the mean differential. You see, the roof has predetermined the limits of ac.tion of any group of packages, but individuals may move off the path if their diversions are counter-balanced by others."".""It's the last great adventure left to mankind"".- Screams a drooping lady.offering her dream dolls at less than extortionate prices,.and as the notes and coins are taken out.I'm taken in, to the factory floor..for the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.- All ready to use.the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.- I just need a fuse..Got people stocked in every shade,.Must be doing well with trade..Stamped, addressed, in odd fatality..That evens out their personality..With profit potential marked by a sign,.I can recognize some of the production line,.No bite at all in labor bondage,.Just wrinkled wrappers or human bandage..Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.- All ready to use.it's the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.- I just need a fuse..As he wanders along the line of packages, Rael notices a familiarity in some of their faces. He finally comes upon some of the members of his old gang and worries about his own safety. Running out through the factory floor, he catches sight of his brother John with a number 9 stamped on his forehead..The hall runs like clockwork.Their hands mark out the time;.Empty in their fullness.Like a frozen pantomime..Everyone's a sales representative.Wearing slogans in their shrine..Dishing out fail safe superlative,.Brother John is No. 9..it's the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.- All ready to use.it's the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.- I just need a fuse..The decor on the ceiling.has planned out their future day.I see no sign of free will,.so I guess I have to pay,.pay my way,.for the Grand Parade.it's the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.- All ready to use.it's the Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.- I just need a fuse."
"I can feel your body.When I'm lying in bed.There's too much confusion.Going around through my head.And it makes me so angry.To know that the flame still burns.Why can't I get over?.When will I ever learn?.[Chorus:].Old love, leave me alone.Old love, go on home.I can see your face.But I know that it's not real.It's just an illusion.Caused by how I used to feel.And it makes me so angry.To know that the flame will always burn.I'll never get over.I know now that I'll never learn.[Chorus]"
"Papa come quick, Joy's gone to the city.What we gonna do now that Jody's gone.She left a note on the TV and Papa it's a pity.What we gonna do now that Jody's gone..Mama's been cryin' in the kitchen since mornin'.She cried right through As The World Turns.I seen it myself and papa it's a bitchin'.Let's haul ass before the baby gets burned..Gas up the old Ford, get out the road map.They got a head start about half a day.Load up the shotgun, put it in the gun rack.Jody's with Chico down in East L.A..It must have been that wild-eyed, silver-tongued schemer.A girl like Jody don't think for herself..Him and that Harley and his damn Jalapeno.Smokin' that stuff'll make you hurt yourself..Papa come quick.Papa come quick.Papa come quick.Papa come on.Papa come quick, Joy's gone to the city.What we gonna do now that Jody's gone.She left a note on the TV and Papa it's a pity.What we gonna do now that Jody's gone..Gas up the old Ford, get out the road map.They got a head start about half a day.Stop at the Mobil, pump up the the flat wheel.Jody & Chico and his ding dang deal."
"Evil, runnin' through our brain,.we and evil's about the same..Bad blood through our body flows,.where's the love nobody knows..Beauty in our face you see,.tryin' to hide all our misery, but.Evil, runnin' through my brain,.me and evil are about the same..Evil... in our life.Evil... causin' strife.Lookin for a place to gild a little light.in our souls and minds.Maybe if we learn to pray.life would lend us sunshiny days..And evil runnnin' thru our brains.turn to love and won't be the blame."
"I'm getting bored.Being part of mankind.There's not a lot to do no more.This race is a waste of time.People rushing everywhere.Swarming around like flies.Think I'll buy a forty four.Give 'em all a surprise.Think I'm gonna kill myself.'Cause a little suicide.Stick around for a couple of days.What a scandal if I died.Yeah I'm gonna kill myself.Get a little headline news.I'd like to see what the papers say.On the state of teenage blues.A rift in my family.I can't use the car.I gotta be in by ten o'clock.Who do they think they are.I'd make an exception.If you want to save my life.Brigitte Bardot gotta come.And see me every night.I think I'm gonna kill myself.'Cause a little suicide.Stick around for a couple of days.What a scandal if I died.Yeah I'm gonna kill myself.Get a little headline news.I'd like to see what the papers say.On the state of teenage blues.On the state of teenage blues.Kill myself, suicide.What a scandal if I died.Suicide, headline news.On the state of teenage blues"
"Strange though we made it, in those days that were bare.What pulled us through them, something was there..I can remember, drifting apart,.Thoughtless ways much stronger,.As the time grew longer.One for one not always,.Then you said to me....(*)It's only goodbye, a smile and a cry, and suddenly over, when.(*)I think of you know, in kindness allow. My memory lingers, then.(*)It's only goodbye, my strength telling lies, Just facing what had to be..Mixed my reflections, did we think it was real.Was it forever, fear not, just feel..You had your troubles, yes I had mine..Weren't we both for sharing, No not really caring,.I would realize that, when you said to me....(*)REPEAT......IT'S ONLY GOODBYE....."
"Once I was young and so unsure.I'd try any ill to find the cure.An old man told me.Tryin' to scold me.""Oh, son, don't wade to deep in Bitter Creek,"".(Bitter Creek).Out where the desert meets the sky.Is where I go when I want to hide.Oh, peyote (oh,peyote,mm).She tried to show me.(tried to show me).You know there ain't no cause to weep.at Bitter Creek.(Bitter Creek).Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.We're gonna hit the road for one last time.We can walk right in and steal 'em blind.All that money (All that money,ooh..).No more runnin' (No more runnin').I can't wait to see the old man's face.When I win the race.(Bitter Creek).Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,.Doo doo doo doo doo.Doo........."
"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!.Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!.Just one look at you.My heart grew tipsy in me,.You and you alone.Bring out the gypsy in me!.I love all, the many charms about you!.Above all, I want my arms about you!.Don't be a naughty baby,.Come to papa, come to papa, do!.My sweet embraceable you!"
"I called him for days, he didn't answer the phone.I drove by his house, I knew he was home.A week's worth of papers and mail in the box.I thought he was dead, I picked the lock.I found him in tears in the dark on his knees.With a hole in his chest where his heart used to be.And he said.Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse.Call for the lady with the alligator purse.She knows the spell to lift this curse.Go find the lady with the alligator purse.In an old stone house off 21st.I found the lady with the alligator purse.She answered the door, said I know who you are.She lit a candle, consulted the stars.When I saw her closing that reptile's hide.I asked her point-blank, is my friend going to die.And she said.I'm not a doctor, I'm not a nurse.I'm just the lady with the alligator purse.Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.So said the lady with the alligator purse.She said, look at what happened to Cleopatra.When she didn't take my advice.And Romeo, Juliet, they didn't get it.Too bad, those kids were so nice.By the time we got back to my pitiful pal.There was no sign of life till he saw the alligator.Purse on her arm, the gleam in her eyes.She opened the bag, there was nothing inside.She said, there's no secret, it's love that I use.I just carry this bag because it matches my shoes.And she said.Don't call the doctor, don't call the nurse.Don't call the lady with the alligator purse.Love is the magic of the universe.Take it from the lady with the alligator purse.Love is the magic of the universe.Take it from the lady with the alligator purse.The lady with the alligator purse"

"Talkin' to myself and feelin' old.Sometimes I'd like to quit.Nothin' ever seems to fit.Hangin' around.Nothin' to do but frown.Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.What I've got they used to call the blues.Nothin' is really wrong.Feelin' like I don't belong.Walkin' around.Some kind of lonely clown.Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you.Nice to know somebody loves me.Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do.Run and find the one who loves me (the one who loves me).What I feel has come and gone before.No need to talk it out (talk it out).We know what it's all about.Hangin' around (hangin' around).Nothin' to do but frown.Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do (only thing to do).Run and find the one who loves me.What I feel has come and gone before.No need to talk it out.We know what it's all about.Hangin' around (hangin' around).Nothin' to do but frown.Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.Hangin' around (hangin' around).Nothin' to do but frown.Rainy days and Mondays always get.Me down"

"I looked out the window and seen his bald head.I ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg.Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair.Launched that shot and he was caught out there.Saw the convertible driving by.Loaded up the slingshot and let one fly.He went for his to find he didn't have one.Put him in check correct with my egg gun.The egg a symbol of life.Go inside your house and bust out your wife.Pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke.The trigger I pulled his face the yolk.Reached in his pocket took all his cash.Left my man standing with an egg mustache.Suckers they come a dime a dozen.And when I say dozen you know what I'm talking about.Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg.He was playing the wall and then he broke his leg.Tossed it out the window three minutes hot.Hit the Rastaman he said ""bloodclot!"".Which came first, the chicken or the egg?.I egged the chicken then I ate his leg.Riding the trains in between cars.When I pull out the station, you're gonna get yours.Drive by eggings plaguing L.A..""Yo they just got my little cousin esse"".Sometimes hard boiled sometimes runny.It comes from a chicken not a bunny, dummy.People laugh it's no joke.My name's Yauch and I'm throwing the yolk.Now they got me in a cell but I don't care.It was then that I got caught catching people out there.We all dressed in black we snuck up around the back.We began to attack the eggs did crack on Haze's back.Sam I am down with the program.Green eggs and ham Yosemite Sam.Come Halloween you know I come strapped.I throw it at a sucker K-pap.You made the mistake you judge a man by his race.You go through life with egg on your face.You woke up in the morning with a peculiar feeling.You looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling.Families punk rock the businessman.I'll dog anybody with an egg in my hand.Not like the crack that you put in a pipe.But crack on your forehead here's a towel now wipe"

Why must I be so lonely?.When so many people pass me by.I've been waiting for oh so long now.And yet I'm unable to answer why.I can't be made to give up now.Can you find room for me.In your heart somehow?.I wanna be loved.I just wanna be loved.I guess I'm a victim of loneliness.But why should this be my destiny?.A foolish man for a lot of my life.Shouldn't there be someone.Someone for me?.I hope and I pray some happy day.That I'll be around to hear you say.I wanna be loved.I just wanna be loved

"There's a story told of a very gentle boy.And the girl who wore his ring.Through the wintery snow.The world they knew was one.For their hearts were full of spring.As the days grew old.And the nights passed into time.And the weeks and years took wind.Gentle boy, tender girl.Their love remained still young.For their hearts were full of spring.Then one day they died.And their graves were side by side.On a hill where robins sing.And they say violets.Grow there the whole year round.For their hearts were full of spring"

"We rose early on a desert morning.Into the burning sands we go.Said ""good day"" to the thieves and fakers.We did it all for a chance to tell a tale.We rode on until early next morning.Eyes burned and our nerves were frayed.I confess I felt so worthless.I lost hope, big price to pay.Now there were stars and there were wild birds circling.A lot of screams and a fight breaks out.Between wars and between burnings.He did it all for a chance to die for love.I went higher than I'd ever been before.I went lower than the depths could hold.I said a prayer, then without warning.A figure rose up from the desert floor.He looked at me, said ""how high are you?"".I looked at him with my one good eye.We just smiled and stared in silence.He did it all for a chance to die for love.We think again on the dreams that made us.As I stare into your beautiful eyes.There came a day when the words had meaning.The sky cried and the waters came rushing.I do believe you are the lone survivor.I suspect you of the bravest deeds.He just smiled and said it's all worth it.I fell down on my knees and I cried, for love"

"When two lovers meet in Mayfair so the legends tell.Songbirds sing and winter turns to spring.Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell.I know such enchantment can be.Cause it happened one evening to me.That certain night, the night we met,.There was magic abroad in the air,.There were angels dining at the Ritz.And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square.I may be right, I may be wrong,.But I'm perfectly willing to swear.That when you turn'd and smiled at me.A nightingale sang in Berkley Square.The moon that lingered over London town.Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.How could he know we two were so in love,.The whole darn world seemed upside down.The streets of town were paved with stars,.It was such a romantic affair,.And as we kissed and said goodnight,.A nightingale sang in Berkley Square"
"Daybreak.How can I ever leave this place beside you?.You were the only one I ever cried to.The night is through.And now it's heartache.I should be home before he sees it's daybreak.Light from the sky is shining through the curtain lace.I never really meant to stay.And now it's daybreak.We were just sitting and talking.Oh, who would have thought we'd be spending the night.Dreading the light of daybreak?.And now it's daybreak.We were like storybook children.Hey, but, like all good fairytale, this one must end.Here is the end it's nearly daybreak.How can I ever leave this place beside you?.You were the only one I ever cried to.The night is through.How can I ever leave?.In the night I'm suppose to leave.But what can I do?.What can I say, what can I do?

"She says, 'it's cold where you brought me'.He says, 'Darling, don't worry.You can stay in my arms.Until the springtime comes.We'll let the snow drift around us.And wait for the robin and the crocus.To tell us that our love has again found the sun'.Lone oak stands tall,.Bare arms scratch the sky,.Dry leaves cracking beneath our feet.Hand in hand we've watched.The autumn fires burn -.Summer's dreams collapsing,.Chestnuts in need of gathering,.The whole world lies rotting in the street.Soon we will walk with collars high.Like ramparts raised for the siege.We'll bow to her beauty,.Cower from her fury.Sent as a judgment for a slight.Long past forgotten.Winter's love once again unrequited.Winter's love once again unrequited.She says, 'Babe are you sleeping?'.He says, 'No, wide awake and thinking.Of a dream I just had about the two of us.He takes his hand to her cheek now,.His lips to her brow,.Their whispers pile softly.By the foot of the bed"
"As I lay by your side and hold you tonight.I want you to understand this love that that I feel.Is so right and so real I realize how lucky I am.And to you ever wonder if my love is true.There is something that I want to make clear with you.There's no way I could make it without you.There's no way that I'd even try.If I had to survive without you in my life.I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way.It means so much to me whenever I see that 'wanting me' look in your eyes.I don't know how I could do without holding you close every night.I've waited so long just to have you to hold.Now that I've got you, I'll never let go.There's no way I could make it without you.There's no way that I 'd even try.If I had to survive without you in my life.I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way.I never knew what to do, what I was missin'.Now you say forever, I find my heart is listenin', yes, I'm listenin'.There's no way I could make it without you.There's no way that I 'd even try.If I had to survive without you in my life.I know I wouldn't last a day, oh baby, there's no way"

"He was a hard-headed man he was brutally handsome.And she was terminally pretty.She held him up and he held her for ransom.In the heart of the cold, cold city.He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude.They said he was ruthless said he was crude.They had one thing in common: they were good in bed.She'd say, ""Faster, faster. ""The lights are turning red."".Life in the fast lane Surely make you lose your mind.Life in the fast lane.Eager for action and hot for the game.The coming attraction, the drop of a name.They knew all the right people; They took all the right pills.They threw outrageous parties; They paid heavenly bills.There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face.She pretended not to notice she was caught up in the race.Out every evenin' until it was light.He was too tired to make it; she was too tired to fight about it..Life in the fast lane surely make you lose your mind.Life in the fast lane.Life in the fast lane everything all the time.Life in the fast lane.Blowin' and burnin' blinded by thirst.They didn't see the stop sign; Took a turn for the worst.She said, ""Listen, baby. You can hear the engine ring..""We've been up and down this highway; haven't seen a god-damn thing."".He said, ""Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash."".""The doctor say he's coming but you gotta pay in cash."".They were rushing down that freeway; Messed around and got lost.They didn't care they were just dyin' to get off..And it was life in the fast lane.Surely make you lose your mind.Life in the fast lane.Life in the fast lane everything all the time.Life in the fast lane"
"Precious memories, how they linger.How they ever flood my soul.In the stillness of the midnight.Precious, sacred scenes unfold..Precious father, loving mother.Fly across the lonely years.And old home scenes of my childhood.In fond memory appear..In the stillness of the midnight.Echoes from the past I hear.Old-time singing, gladness bringing.From that lovely land somewhere..As I travel on life's pathway.Know not what the years may hold.As I ponder, hope grows fonder.Precious memories flood my soul."
My clothes don't fit and I have no point of view.I got a bad reputation but I don't believe it's true.I had something going but I blew it down the can.Not exactly what I planned.I'm a ramshackle man.That's what I am.I look like a joker but I feel like a one eyed jack.Shuffling around never get to the top of the park.I said to the dealer put the ace in my hand.But he couldn't give a damn.I'm a ramshackle man.That's what I am.I sit down thinking bout the things I have to do.I start out fine then I pick up something new.Stumbled through the door that's how it all began.Now it's buried in the sand.I'm a ramshackle man.That's what I am.The stars shine bright when the boys come out to play.Never feeling more than I'm feeling right here today.I used to be fresh but now I'm second hand.I do what I can.I'm a ramshackle man.That's what I am

"Ten years ago on a cold dark night.Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light.Just a few at the scene, and they all did agree.That the man who ran looked a lot like me.The judge said ""Son, what's your alibi?.If you were somewheres else, then you won't have to die"".But I spoke not a word, tho' it meant my life.For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.Chorus:.She walks these hills in a long black veil.Visits my grave when the night winds wail.Nobody knows, nobody sees.Nobody knows, but me.The scaffold is high, eternity near.She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear.But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan.In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones"
"Along the palo duro canyon.Red river shows so may eyes.One eye squinting, shaded from the sun, shoot me.Black a oil, his hair shone.Lily white, his skin glistened.Restless as the reed between his lips blew.It's just that mean old texas sun.It makes me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head.What day is this? i, quiet, asked the sky.What time is it? he asked me, sitting up.Love that villan on the run.He's got me spinning 'round and falling on my head.What are you running from? I asked the white boy.From the guys who chase me therecome run.I need your dark skin.To sit beside me in my car, light up my cigar.I'll light you.It's just that mean old texas sun.It makes me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head.Love that villan on the run.He's got me spinning 'round and falling on my head.And dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head.He said you're ony indian in oklahoma.You could be melting in america.White on red, melt with my skin.These two hearts will beat along the walls of our hotel.I need your dark skin.It's just that mean old texas sun.It makes me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head.The last I saw of oklahoma.A gas station fading in the dusk.Goodbye my father, I thought, I'm carrying the light.The light of my comanche.Make sure the dog remembers me.I dream the sand beneath your feet.I hold the light.It's just that mean old texas sun.It makes me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head.Love that villan on the run.He's got me spinning 'round and falling on my head.And dizzy, dizzy, dizzy in my head"
"Soldiers come down, they're gonna raze your home.take all your children babe and leave you all alone.now there's just one man who can save you all.Old Man Moses, that's name now can you heed the call.Chorus:.Old Man Moses is coming he knows what it's all about.Old Man Moses is coming he can get you out.Old Man Moses is coming he's got the strenght of the Lord.Old Man Moses is coming he will create a ford 'cross the Red Sea.Born in a slave's home raised by the Pharaoh's hand.he's got one purpose in life, to lead you to the promised land.he floated down the river in a boat made out of reeds.now he's the man I know who will 'fill his people's needs.Follow me I've come to set you free.take my hand and part the waters.I'm just one man lead you to the promised land.oh come on children, oh you know I'm the one.I'm the one the Lord has chosen for you.I am the man for you.I'm the man to set you free."
