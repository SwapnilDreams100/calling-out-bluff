Well, you got the key to my heart.But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body.And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside.No need for me to lie.It's too big, it's too wide.It's too strong, it won't fit.It's too much, it's too tough.He talk like this 'cause he can back it up.He got a big ego, such a huge ego.I love his big ego, it's too much.He walk like this 'cause he can back it up.Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose.You can leave with me or you could have the blues.Some call it arrogant, I call it confident.You decide when you find on what I'm working with.Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs.Better yet them thighs.Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes.Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me.It's too big, it's too wide.It's too strong, it won't fit.It's too much, it's too tough.I talk like this 'cause I can back it up.I got a big ego, such a huge ego.But he love my big ego, it's too much.I walk like this 'cause I can back it up.I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up.I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up.I, I can back it up, I can back it up.I walk like this 'cause I can back it up.It's too big, it's too wide.It's too strong, it won't fit.It's too much, it's too tough.He talk like this 'cause he can back it up.He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego.I love his big ego, it's too much.He walk like this 'cause he can back it up.Ego so big, you must admit.I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch.Ego so strong, if you ain't know.I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano"
"playin' everything so easy,.it's like you seem so sure..still your ways, you dont see.i'm not sure if they're for me..then things come right along our way, though we didn't truly ask..it seems as if they're gonna linger.with every delight they bring,.just like what you have truly seemed..i'm trying to think of what you really want to say,.even through my darkest day..you might want to leave me,.feeling strange about you.like you're gonna let me know,.when words then slipped out of you..when words dont come so easy to say.you just leave me feeling, come what may.though i want things coming from your way..i say to you, you bore me all the time.when you seem to hold back all in you,.all that you want to let me know..why dont you have the courage?.speak up and i'll listen,.if you truly want me to know, then tell me..is there something wrong with you.and you seem fastened there..it sounds as if there'll be a melody.if things in you are let out.and then i will feel alright..when you sleep, do you feel the same,.exactly as i do?.i really want to hear things from you,.though i've felt something new.eversince you acted that way..if i go,.would you still mind telling me?.if i stay,.you seem to let the days go by..if you truly want to let me know,.then tell me."
"If you search.For tenderness.It isn't hard to find.You can have the love.You need to live.But if you look.For truthfulness.You might just.As well be blind.It always seems to be.So hard to give.Chorus:.Honesty.Is such a lonely word.Everyone is so untrue.Honesty.Is hardly ever heard.And mostly.What I need from you.I can always.Find someone.To say.They sympathize.If I wear my heart.Out on my sleeve.But I don't want.Some pretty face.To tell me.Pretty lies.All I want.Is someone.To believe.(Chorus).I can find a lover.I can find a friend.I can have security.Until the bitter end.Anyone can comfort me.With promises again.I know, I know.When I'm deep.Inside of me.Don't be.Too concerned.I won't ask.For nothin'.While I'm gone.But when I want.Sincerity.Tell me where else.Can I turn.When.You're the one.That I depend upon.(Chorus)"

"Took me a while but I'm finally here.So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear.See I've been picked out to be picked on.Talked about, out my friends mouths.I've been beat down til He turned my life around.Seems like I always fall short of being worthy.Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me.I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me.Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me.I used to wake up somedays.And wish I'd stayed asleep.Cause I went to bed on top of the world.Today the world's on top of me.Now everybody's got opinions.They ain't been in my position.That it breaks my heart.When I hear what they have to say about me.Seems like I always fall short of being worthy.Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me.I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me.Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me.And I'm not perfect.Yes I do wrong.I'm trying my best.But it aint good enough.Shunned by the world.If I don't succeed.Cause I aint good enough.But He still loves me.If you ain't worthy just raise your hands.And let me know that you understand.That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved.Stand for him or fall for anything.Cause through his eyes we all look the same.What will we do without pain?.Seems like I always fall short of being worthy.Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me.I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me.Cause I ain't good enough but He still love me.I'm not perfect.Yes I do wrong.I'm trying my best.But it aint good enough.Shunned by the world.If I dont succeed.Cause I aint good enough.But He still loves me.I'm not perfect.Yes I do wrong.I'm trying my best.But it aint good enough.Shunned be the word.If I don't succeed.Cause I ain't good enough.But He still loves me.No, I ain't good enough.But He still loves me.No, I ain't good enough.But He still loves me.No, I aint good enough.But He still loves me.No, I ain't good enough.But He still loves me.(But the Lord still loves me)"

"Ooh, ooh, ahh.Star, star.I'm wishing.I'm wishing.On a star.I'm wishing on a star.To follow where you are.I'm wishing on a dream.To follow what it means.And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see.I'm wishing on the people who really dream.And I'm wishing on tomorrow rain never comes.And I'm wishing on all of the things we never done.I never thought I'd see the time when you would be.So far away from home.So far away from me.Just think of all the moments that we spent.I just can't let you go from me, we were meant.I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know.In the game of love, you reap what you sow.(Sow).I feel it's time we should make up baby.I feel it's time for us to get back together.And make the best of things, oh baby.When we're together whether or never.I feel, it's time we should make up baby.I feel, it's time for us to get back together.And make the best of things, oh baby.When we're together.(Let's get together, baby).Whether or never.I'm wishing on a star.To follow where you are.I'm wishing on a dream.To follow what it means.And I'm wishing on the rainbows that I see.I'm wishing on the people who really dream.Hoping all the days to come and days to go.Hoping on the days of loving, loving you so.Wishing on a star, wishing on a dream.Baby, forgive me.Lets make up, I'm sorry.Lets be together, breakup? Never.The love we have seems special so far.'Til we get back, I'm wishing on a star"
