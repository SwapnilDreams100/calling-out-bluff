If I've had my way I'd leave here today I'd leave in a hurry.I'd find me a place where I could stay and not have to worry.I'd find me a spot on some mountain top with no one around me.With valleys and streams and birds in the trees and lakes that surround me.A place I could use a place I could lose these Tennessee blues.A place to forget all my regrets and keep just a right time.A place I could sleep with nothing but peace and feel free an all time.A place I could use a place I could lose these Tennessee blues.A place I could lose these Tennessee blues
"It's only small town talk.You know how people are.They can't stand to see you.Being who you are.It's only small town talk.Don't pay it no mind.Don't believe a word they say.They do it to you every time.You can't believe everything you hear.Only half of what you might see.But if you have to believe in anyone.I'd believe, darling, believe in me.It's only small town talk.A well-known fact.You don't even know.How one other might react.To what you're thinking.What are they thinking.It's only small town talk.They're telling all the lies.And make some people crazy.They don't realize we're still thinking.We're only people, trying to live together.We're trying to make this little life work.Who are we to judge one another.It may lead to tears or maybe something even worse.It's only small town talk.You know how people are.They can't stand to see you.Being just exactly who you are.It's small town talk.Pittle, pattle, it's small town talk.Tittle, tattle, it's small town talk"

Wild apple trees blooming all around.I must be in a good place now.Sunshine coming through.Rainbow coloured sky.Paints pretty pictures in my mind.Oh what a good day to go fishing.And catch the sunset in the hills.Dream of my yesterdays and tomorrow.And hope that you'll be with me still.Saw a butterfly and I named it after you.Your name has such a pleasant sound.Love is all around and all I see is you.I must be in a good place now.Oh what a good day to go fishing.And catch the sunset in the hills.Dream of my yesterdays and tomorrow.And hope that you'll be with me still.Saw a butterfly and I named it after you.Your name has such a pleasant sound.Love is all around and all I see is you.I must be in a good place now.I must be in a good place now

Oh it's you sweet baby.Though we've had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby.Only hopin' it's not too late to try again.It's you, sweet baby.Won't you try and believe in what I say, sweet baby.I will always be right there by your sided, right by your side.(chorus)"
Thoughts that I can't erase.Brought from a distant place.But for a twist of fate.Africa could be my home
"Love songs, sweet love songs.Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love.Hasn't every way to write a love song been written.And hasn't every way to tell the story been told.Hasn't everyone been moved and soothed by the melodies.Aren't there other tales to be told, other stories to unfold.Haven't we anything else to say.Or are we merely trapped to find another way.To say the same things.Don't we have other thoughts, other dreams.Girl it seems every time I search that quiet place.I find myself with you face to face.In my mind there's nothing left to say except, ""I love you"".Love songs, sweet love songs.(I love you).Hasn't every way to sing a love song been sung.And hasn't every way to phrase the message been done.Haven't all the great ones sung the melodies that've wooed you.And aren't there other songs to be sung with messages untold.Seems that we've lost our will to challenge the mind.And be a unique kind of art it's been for me.Oh a teacher or prophet by pen.Girl but wait, don't get me wrong, I love a good good love song.One that gets me real good, when I close my eyes.I only seem to find the words ""I love you"".""I love you"", girl I can't help myself.(Love songs, sweet love songs).And as long as you keep needin' them.I'll keep servin' 'em till my last breath.(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love).No, I'm not alone, there're others like you and me.'Cause there's always someone who wants.To tell their story of need.It's a simple story, one as old as time.(Love songs, sweet love songs).And we all know that sometimes.Love don't have no reason or rhyme.(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love).Hingin' on to those love songs.Oh love, oh love, oh love.Love songs, sweet love songs"
"Though we push this feeling aside.And though we cry, this can't go on forever.Seasons come and seasons flow and I know.That most things come to an end.But you're so wonderful.Good for me in every way.And I love that message you left on my.Service today.""Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you"".Girl, I'm thinkin' about you, too.You've become so special, someone I don't.Want to lose.""Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love"".I need you in my life.Sometimes the simple things are the best.Things to say.And sometimes it's what you least expect.That will make your day.And sometimes it's not words at all but a.Glance saying ""I'm okay"".Sometimes a simple ""Hi, it's me"" will set.You on your way.Like a warm breeze.A memory that stays in your head.One that feels so good you'll wish you could.Live it instead.""Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you"".Girl, I'm dreamin' about you, too.You're so special, someone, the only one.I choose.""Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love"".I need you in my life.Never say no, 'cause what you won't do.You do for love, no matter what they say.You'll swallow your pride.Reach down deep inside.And find what is true and what's real.Baby, oh I'm thinkin' 'bout you.Yes, I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love.I'm thinkin' 'bout you.Baby, oh I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love"
"Got that thang that you need.Uncut and spreadin' the seed.And when you're feelin' down.Look, we'll be around.Splish, splash we water your mind.Never serve ya till it's time.We will supply the heat.Good things from head to feet.We will be your rock.And when you're really in need.Turn it to the right and feel the flow.And if you want some more.Just look down, we're kinda low.We will be your rock.Just when you need to be found.We'll be right back on the block.Right back on the block, right back.You know we'll be around.Say you been lost in a barren land.With no water or funk on hand.Hot sweat runs down your chin.Look what a mess you're in.Put your hands upon the rock.(Let the vibes flow through).Then check the time on your clock.(As if it really knew).Turn on your radio, big daddy's flowin' so.Pump up the volume it's kinda low"
"Summertime.Hopin' that you'll pass my way, hmm.Summertime, oh baby.Hopin' I'll see you again.Summertime.Summertime, my baby.Summertime.Hopin' that you'll pass my way, hmm.Summertime, oh baby.Hopin' I'll see you again.Summertime.Summertime, my baby.Summertime.Hopin' that you'll pass my way, hmm.Summertime, oh baby.Hopin' I'll see you again.Summertime.Hopin' that you'll pass my way, hmm.Summertime, my sweet baby.Hopin' I'll see you again.Summer, summertime.Make it right.We can try to make it last, oh.Summer, summertime.Summertime.Hopin' that you'll pass my way, hmm.Summertime, oh baby.Hopin' I'll see you again.Summer, summertime.Make it right.We can try to make it last, oh.Summer, summertime.Summertime.Hopin' that you'll pass my way, hmm.Summertime"
"Deep in your eyes love calls.To my surprise I'm falling.Deep in your eyes love calls.There's no surprise I'm falling.Falling, I'm falling.Ooh.Falling, I'm falling"
"Whatever happened to honor and love.Self respect and the will to rise above.Whatever happened to the right thing to do.Love your brother, let peace abide with you.Whatever happened to live and let live.Tolerance and a willingness to give.Whatever happened to the goodness in a man.Was good ever there or has good lost its hand.Whatever happened to the drive to learn.To better oneself just because one yearns.Whatever happened to the unique voice.The one of a kind giving us a greater choice.Whatever happened to striving towards goals.Seems we're our own worst enemy and foe"
"Givin' it up is what we must do.Everyone on the line, no other way to choose.The whole world is in our hands.We can make a better place it's in the.Master's plan.We can do it if we try.And if others ask you why say.It's our world.Far too many just don't care, a living negative.It's our world.And we know right and wrong.But far too many close their eyes and hide.Their fears at home.It's our world.And we must keep our love alive.We've done so much and come so far.But yet we still can't get along and don't.Know who we are.War and pain, I read somewhere.Said they will always be with us until He comes again.Does that mean we shouldn't try.Should I just lay on down and die.Our world.Only world.It's our world, it's a gift.(Celebrate life) we can find a better way.We can change it (rearrange it).And there's really nothing else to say.It's our world, just keep it goin', do it.It's our world, we better try, honey.It's our world, just show your love.It's our world, don't let it get you down.Keep it goin', just keep it goin', do it.It's our world, we can do it.To be, to be, honey.It's our world, take care"
"Light, Beautiful light.Light, Savior from darkness.Light, Precious power.Light, Look to the light.Come learn the way, hear what we say.Come learn the way, hear what we say.(Chorus).Look into the Crystals see what you can see,.If you desire..Lost in reflectios see what you can be.Hearts filled with fire..(Chorus)"
"I've got a perfect situation.And I'm so lucky that I feel the way I do, girl.I've got no heavy complications.You keep my love from coming straight to you.Oh you are smiling with another.Your eyes keep telling me you just don't care.If we could talk just for a minute.I get your number and we go from there.Oh you (girl) are on my mind (on my mind).And I love to make you mine (I'll make you mine).Reach your heart and soul to me (on my mind).Turn your love to ecstasy (baby love, baby love).Oh you (girl) are on my mind (on my mind).And I love to make you mine (I'll make you mine).Reach your heart and soul to me (on my mind).Turn your love to ecstasy (baby love, baby love).I caught your eye just for a moment.And now you know the way I feel about you, girl.You keep on seeking my attention.I think I see what you were planning to do.With some excuse you leave the table.You want to meet me near the powder room, yeah.I follow you without his notice.You touch my hand and slip your number to me.Oh you (girl) are on my mind (on my mind).And I love to make you mine (I'll make you mine).Reach your heart (girl) and soul to me (on my mind).Turn your love to ecstasy (baby, baby, baby, baby).Reach out your hands to me.And our love for sure will be (baby love, baby love).Reach out (reach out) your heart to me (reach your baby).Turn your love to ecstasy.Oh you are on my mind.And I love to make you mine.Reach your heart and soul to me.Turn your love to ecstasy (baby, baby, baby, baby).Reach out your hands to me.And our love will surely be (baby love, baby love).Reach out your heart to me (reach out baby).Turn your love to ecstasy (baby, baby).Reach out your heart to me.Turn your love to ecstasy.Reach out your hands to me.And our love will surely be.Reach out"

You walk into my life.And change the balance of my days.With your eyes you say.I am yours and you are mine.But still something's very wrong.No I can't just go along.Though you want to stay.I must find a reason to delay.[Chorus:].We're not the same.You play a game.I know.But if I keep my feelings strong.I'll find the song you sing.Though i can tell.We're worlds apart and in my heart it's clear.That Love has found a cloudy day.I'm here to say that.I was born to love you.Such a lovely face.With a warm and tender smile.Though I want you so.Something deep inside keeps saying.Don't trust your heart this time.Could my mind be playing games.Am I so betrayed.That my heart and mind can never be the same.[Chorus]
"I have the answer yes I've got the power in my hands.and I know it but I just can't find the way to show it.and I've got the reasons and the excuses to satisfy.for the moment but the truth would let me high.The morning you and love you're in, oh, my lady.the morning you and love I don't want you to get away.the morning you and love I know it will be this easy.the morning you and love.Watching you sleep in the morning sun.remembering the night we had before.all the loving makes me want to love you more and more.but I keep hesitating cause I'm just not ready to settle down with one woman but my heart's turned me around.The morning you and love are you the right lady.the morning you and love and why do I feel this way.the morning you and love it can be this easy.the morning you and love, no, no..interlude.The morning you and love I don't want you to get away.the morning you and love should I go or should I stay.the morning you and love you're in alright lady.the morning you and love.Should I go or should I stay.for another day.Should I stay"
"I grew up in a small town.World War II housing.For people of color.Now when I was a kid round 8 years old.My bedroom wall was next to a single guy.A thin wall away from mine.Was that a sign.Trippin'.Trippin' on a memory.You know I'm trippin'.Memories.Nearly every weekend the guy played music.That I later found out was jazz.The bass funky ....the sax player.The trumpet soloed.maybe Ray Charles or Les McCann.The sound was oh so soaked.with a lot of blues.Maybe it was Miles.The music really drew me in.I love the way it made me feel.Made me hope this dream.Just trippin'.Trippin' on a memory.A memory.The music would play as he got dressed.The groove that they do at the club.When the DJ turned off the music.They're leaving home with some girl to rub.The music would start up again.Surrounded by the sex.the blues.the knocks on the wall.Mama was always screaming.Is somebody hurt.Or did somebody fall.backgroud.I never knew ,you'd draw me in.foreground..I loved the music.Loved the way it drew me in.Loved the way it made me feel.Made me hope and dream that day.I dreamed of.Playing on the records.Being at the gig.Knockin on the thin wall.Later I found that music could mean.What you want it to mean.Its the yen and the yang.As Cannon used to say Ahuuuummm !.THE BALL USED TO SAY AAAHHHUUUMMM !.As the ball,used to say AAAAAHHHUMMMM !"
"Girl, just take some time.Let me try to find the words I want to say to you.I been searchin' my mind.I got to find the reasons I feel the way I do.Let me emphasize that I recognize.What I should and should not do.And though I know it's wrong.Every now and then I phone.Just to talk to you.Sometimes love.Has no rhyme, and no reason.Even if we try to be cool.At the strangest times.Love can make a connection.If you trust your heart to choose.Sometimes you cross my mind.And I don't know why.But I hear from you.And though I want to stay close.I realize the most we'll ever be is good friends.I got kids at home.I can't leave them alone.This I'm telling you.I've got another life.Cause I still love my wife.Though I still want you.Sometimes love.Has no rhyme, and no reason.Even if we try to be cool.At the strangest times.Love can make a connection.If you trust your heart to choose.Even when you trust your heart.Sometimes love.Has no rhyme, and no reason.Even if we try to be cool.At the strangest times.Love can make a connection.If you trust your heart to choose.Sometimes love.Has no rhyme, and no reason.Even if we try to be cool.At the strangest times.Love can make a connection.If you trust your heart to choose"

"As I walk this hall alone I wonder.exactly why it is I'm leaving.when there's nothing there for me to return to.other than blind faith.with a lack of believing.and not to say that I have nothing.I have everything and I am grateful.but my head is trying to tell me something.in this state of mind I feel so hateful.and I don't understand.and I'm not going to try to because.now that I've seen it.I couldn't walk away no.even if I wanted to, yes.now that I've seen it.even though I'm leaving now.every bit of me is still there.well I am filled with a quiet resolution.and questions posed without solution.and in my realm of indecision.finally I feel as though I can see something.and though this beacons ever flashing.Ii can't revisit without rehashing.when I'm stuck in where I created fear.I can not fix myself from here.and I'm starting to understand.at least in this state I believe something because.now that I've seen it.I couldn't walk away no.even if I wanted to, yes.now that I've seen it.even though I'm leaving now.every bit of me is still there.the amount of times.I've seen the edge.of my own head.is unrelenting.the floor falls out.and I am left with.thoughts that move.without consenting.when all I want is peace.and all I want to believe in.is knowing without seeing.and wanting without fear.now that I've seen it.I couldn't walk away no.even if I wanted to, yes.now that I've seen it.even though I'm leaving now.every bit of me is still there"
"I've heard there was a secret chord.That David played and it pleased the Lord.But you don't really care for music, do you?.It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth.The minor fall, the major lift.The baffled king composing hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Your faith was strong but you needed proof.You saw her bathing on the roof.Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.She tied you to a kitchen chair.She broke your throne, she cut your hair.And from your lips she drew the hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Maybe I've been here before.I've seen this room, I've walked this floor.I used to live alone before I knew you.I've seen your flag on the marble arch.Love is not a victory march.It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.There was a time you let me know.What's real and going on below.But now you never show it to me, do you?.And remember when I moved in you?.The holy dark was moving too.And every breath we drew was hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Maybe there's a God above.And all I ever learned from love.Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.And it's not a cry you can hear at night.It's not somebody who's seen the light.It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah"
Stepping on.the thoughts of all pain.released from this anger.is some place I would like to be.and when I feel myself defeated.I bleed.and when I see them twist around.dancing in their own wake.I rage.And I don't want to exist on this plane.crashing down to the level of.depth of skin.flesh and bone.all wrapped up in pages.flashed in our faces.laughing and spiteful.Run away.Lost again.misdirected and folded.drowned in bones.and thrown away.they told me to disappear.and slowly dive.into the shallow end.of the gene pool.Try to hold on to what I believe.disappeared.no longer here as anything but.wretched and disfigured.so I slash myself again.and I drown my hopes again.lose myself in this disease.Lost again.misdirected and folded.drowned in bones.and thrown away.they told me to disappear.and slowly dive.into the shallow end.of the gene pool.Cut yourself to the mold.Nothing left to rid yourself of.but bile and blood.torn skin screaming.and silenced as we.replace marble with plastic.Lost again.misdirected and folded.drowned in bones.and thrown away.they told me to disappear.and slowly dive.into the shallow end.of the gene pool

"Effortless.Words & Music by Allison Crowe.As performed by Allison Crowe.I'm trying not to try so hard,.Makes me wonder if it's really effortless,.Or if I'm fooling myself?.'Cause if I have to put so much of me.Into trying not to care,.Where am I then?.I'm lying..And do you see the way I walk away?.I never really know what I should say,.So it comes out wrong,.If it comes out at all..So I straighten myself out,.I bring me back down,.""Don't be ridiculous,.You are so wrong."".But then I'm drifting,.On a wave of thought..I get lost in the tides,.And I can barely recognize myself..I don't mind,.'Cause do you see the way I walk away?.I never really know what I should say,.So it comes out wrong,.If it comes out at all..So I try to act the way I would.If I was someone that wasn't me..But you wipe that away, don't you?.And I am falling down,.I am tripping on words,.I am out of my mind..You know, this is not like me..I'm not usually happy, I swear..And do you see the way I walk away?.I never really know what I should say.So it comes out wrong..And I turn my back.And I don't look back..I am unafraid.......but really I'm just kidding..I'm terrified,.And I think I like it..And I don't care if I look ridiculous,.Trying to be effortless."
"Skeletons and Spirits.Words & Music by Allison Crowe.Take your sympathy and shove it.as for the pain,.well, I love it.I'll eat your words.I'll devour your soul.I will laugh like a lemur.as you crawl back into your hole.I won't deny you,.but I'll pay you no heed.And, if you keep stabbing me,.I will probably bleed.But, I'll pretend I'm a cloud.and my rain will surround you.And if you keep hurting me.I'll eventually drown you.And, yes I know.I'm a little bit off.But, you, you can't leave, you can't open the door.you think you're unique but I've seen you before.so run, run away from the fires that burn.you will do this again and again.but you will never learn.So keep looking down.as you crush me keep smiling.'cause I will get up.and there's no denying.that I am one of your punching clowns.you can keep on striking.but you can't keep me down.You always think that you.are fearless and right.but I think that you.are afraid in the night.of the ghosts, of the spirits.that crawl into your head.of the skeletons that'll haunt you.until you're dead.but, now, you can't leave, you can't open the door.you think you're unique but I've seen you before.so run, run away from the fires that burn.you will do this again and again and again and again.but, now, you can't leave, you can't open the door.you think you're unique but I've seen it all before.so run, run away from the fires that burn.but you will never learn.you will never learn.you will never learn"
"Just before our love got lost you said.I am as constant as a Northern Star.And I said, constantly in the darkness.Where's that at?.If you want me I'll be in the bar.On the back of a cartoon coaster.In the blue TV screen light.I drew a map of Canada.Oh Canada.With your face sketched on it twice.Oh you are in my blood like holy wine.You taste so bitter and so sweet.Oh I could drink a case of you darling.And I would still be on my feet.I would still be on my feet.Oh I am a lonely painter.I live in a box of paints.I am frightened by the devil.And I'm drawn to those that ain't afraid.And I remember when you told me, you said.Love is touching souls.Well surely you touched mine.'Cause part of you pours out of me.In these lines from time to time.Oh you're, you are in my blood like holy wine.You taste so bitter and you taste so sweet.Oh I could drink a case of you.I could drink a case of you darling.And I would still be on my feet.I would still be on my feet.And I met a woman.She had a mouth like yours.She knew your life.She knew your devils and your deeds.She said.Go to him, stay with him if you can.But be prepared to bleed.You are in my blood, you're my holy wine.You taste so bitter, baby, and you taste so sweet.I could drink a case of you darling.I would still be on my feet.I would still be on my feet"

"Open up your door.I know we've both been here before.But there's a shadow fading here.A revolution on its way.Open up your mind.I know I've drowned in there before.But my wings are drying off.And I am ready to dive in.I am coming back again.To you.A way.There is a way.Out of this.There is.Give me a minute.I'll try to explain myself to you.I am the girl who is always with you.The one who's always watching.Give me a break I thought that you.understood this already.And I'm not trying to deceive you.I don't have that much time on my hands.And I am not going to leave you alone.A way.There is a way.Out of this.There is.I see you in the rain.and you are more beautiful.than I have ever seen.And when I walk I want you with me.And I see your smile above me.and I know, I know there is.A way.there is a way.out of this.there is."
"Don't want to raise my head.The world is covered in rage.Voices calling out in anger.Entering erratically into another age.Shadow puppets on the wall.Don't know who to believe.In the darkness standing tall.With a smile upon your face.And I have a right, to.Have a voice, have a say.Whether I'm wrong, or whether I'm right.It doesn't really matter anymore.You've put up a wall.You've put up a fight.And now it seems we've forgotten.What all that was for.Whether you don't want to.Or whether you can't see.What is right in front of your face.Time is running out.And we're already losing ground.With the human race.Don't want to raise my hand.Don't know why I'm scared to say.I feel like I want to call out.Feel like I want to run away.And I don't know why anyone.Should have to suffer anymore.I don't know a lot of anything.But I do wonder what all of this is for.And you have a right, too.To have a voice, have a say.Whether I'm wrong.Or whether I'm right.It doesn't really matter anymore.You've put up a wall.We've put up a fight.And now it seems we've forgotten.What all of that was for.Whether you don't want to.Or whether you can't see.What is right in front of your face.Time is running out.And we're already losing ground.With the human race"
Silence.In the darkness of your soul.Following your call.Grey skies.Belong to me.Open my eyes.Rain falls.On you.On me.I cannot control.Where I am.supposed to be.Bring the winds.That carry you.Bring them to me.I will hold.This rebel light.This renegade sea.Rain falls.On you.On me.You cannot control.Where you.Are supposed to be.I wait in the dark.I carry these chains.I roam through this night.No Ill not open the door.For you to be free.For you to take flight.Rain falls.On you.On me.we cannot control.Where we.Are supposed to be
At the turning of another moon.comes time to end this day.and only so many have to pass.as I am gone away.So I sing you now this lullaby.though it is bittersweet.for we have to part when we close our eyes.but every morning meet.These words fall down upon this page.I never do get to sleep.but to be so far away from you.I lay my head and weep.I know this night will be over soon.there's another day in sight.though darkness falls on empty sheets.only you bring in the light.I will never be the perfect wife.I don't even know what that is.but I will be here and he'll always know.that my heart is his.So count down the days.and draw the curtains back.pour the wine and say.that we'll love as much as we both can do.until our dying day
"For all we know.We may never meet again.Before we go.Make this moment live again.We won't say goodbye.Until the last minute.I'll hold out my hand.And my heart will be in it.For all we know.This might only be a dream.We come and we go.Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream.So baby, love me, love me tonight.Tomorrow was made for some.Oh, but tomorrow.But tomorrow may never, never come.For all we know.Yes, tomorrow may never, never come.For all we know"
"My life was empty when you went away.Even the blue skies above had turned gray.E3ut now that you've come back.My dream of life is here to stay.Those little quarrels that tore us apart.Oh, gee, I can see.They were wrong from the start.But now that you've come back.My dream of life is here to stay"
"I don't know why, I made you cry.I'm sorry sweetheart and yet.Though you shouldn't be lenient with me.I hope you'll forgive and forget.What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?.What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?.I didn't mean to ever be mean to you.If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do.I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you.Why should I take somebody like you and shame you.I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear.So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?.You made me glad, I made you sad.I made you lonesome and blue.And who ever knew.Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you.What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?.What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?.I didn't mean to ever be mean to you.If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do.I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you.Why should I take somebody like you and shame you.I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear.So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?"
"Who do you think is comin' to town.You'll never guess who.Lovable, hugable Emily Brown.Miss Brown to you.What if the rain comes pattering down.My heaven is blue.Can it be sending me Emily Brown.Miss Brown to you.I know her eyes will thrill ya.But go slow, oh, oh.Don't you all get too familiar.Why do you think she's comin' to town.Just wait and you'll see.The lovable little Miss Brown to you.Is baby to me, yes, yes.Mark it down"
"You're a weaver of dreams.You and your strange fascination.You're a weaver of dreams.You and your come-hither smile.Just to hear you speak.Can leave me weak as a babe in arms.Poor little babe in arms.Helpless before your charms.For you're a weaver of dreams.You and your lips warm and tender.Just like magic it seems.Thrilling, enchanting me too.I'm in your spell and there's no cure.I'm lost for sure.`Cause you're a weaver of dreams.And I'm in love with you..(You're a weaver of dreams.You and your strange fascination.You're a weaver of dreams.You and your come hither smile).I'm in your spell and there's no cure.I'm lost for sure.`Cause you're a weaver of dreams.And I'm in love with you..(You're a weaver of dreams,.You're a weaver of dreams)"
"Once I was young.Yesterday, perhaps.Danced with Jim and Paul.And kissed some other chaps.Once I was young.But never was naive.I thought I had a trick or two.Up my imaginary sleeve.And now I know I was naive.I didn't know what time it was.Then I met you.Oh, what a lovely time it was.How sublime it was too.I didn't know what day it was.You held my hand.Warm like the month of May it was.And I'll say it was grand.Grand to be alive, to be young.To be mad, to be yours alone.Grand to see your face, feel your touch.Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own"".I didn't know what year it was.Life was no prize.I wanted love and here it was.Shining out of your eyes.I'm wise and I know what time it is now.Grand to be alive, to be young.To be mad, to be yours alone.Grand to see your face, feel your touch.Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own"".I didn't know what year it was.Life was no prize.I wanted love and here it was.Shining out of your eyes.I'm wise and I know what time it is now"
"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened.A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye.Romance was the theme.And we were the players.I never think of this without a sigh.Lover, one lovely day.Love came, planning to stay.Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting.The setting for nights beyond forgetting.And through these moments apart memories live in my heart.When I recall the love I found on.I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street.Lover, one lovely day.Love came, planning to stay.Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting.The setting for nights beyond forgetting.And through these moments apart memories live in my heart.When I recall the love I found on.On Green Dolphin Street"
"Just when I thought that fate was unkind,.That happiness wasn't to be,.I got a shock and I changed my mind,.A miracle happened to me..If the moon turns green and shadows get up and walk around,.And clouds come tumbling to the ground,.I wouldn't be surprised,.'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?.If the stars turn blue and Willows that weep begin to sing,.And winter changes into Spring,.I wouldn't raise my eyes,.'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?.I thought I was foolish to think of romance.With someone so charming as you,.Thought I was hoping without any chance..But ev'ry hope came true..If the moon turns green and rivers begin to flow up stream,.And this is all a crazy dream,.I wouldn't be surprised,.'Cause anything can happen if you can fall in love with me."
"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you.And day by day my love seems to grow.There isn't any end to my devotion.It's deeper dear by far than any ocean.I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true.So come what may I want you to know.I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay.As we go through the years day by day"
"Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?.Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?.Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?.Or is what i feel the real McCoy?.Is it for all time or simply a lark?.Is it Granada i see or only Asbury Park?.Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?.Or is it at long last love?.Is it an earthquake, or simply a shock?.Is it the good turtle soup, or is it merely the mock?.Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?.Or is what i feel the real McCoy?.Is it for all time or simply a lark?.Is it Granada i see or only Asbury Park?.Is it a fancy, not worth thinking of?.Or is it at long long long last love?"

I've been so many places in my life and time.I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhymes.I've acted out my love in stages.With ten thousand people watching.But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you.I know your image of me is what I hope to be.I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see.There's no one more important to me.Darlin' can't you please see through me.Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you.You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing.You came out in front and I was hiding.But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together.Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding.I love you in a place where there's no space or time.I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine.And when my life is over.Remember when we were together.We were alone and I was singing this song for you.You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing.You came out in front and I was hiding.But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together.Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding.I love you in a place where there's no space or time.I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine.And when my life is over.Remember when we were together.We were alone and I was singing this song for you.We were alone and I was singing this song for you
"I remember other days how I used to weep.Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep.You forgot your promises, every single vow.All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now.I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me.Every road has a turning.That's one thing you're learning.I cried for you; what a fool I used to be.Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer.I found a heart just a little bit truer.I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me.How can I forget the hours that I worried through.Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?.In those days you never thought anything of me.But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free.I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me.Every road has a turning.That's one thing you're learning.I cried for you; what a fool I used to be.Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer.I found a heart just a little bit truer.I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me"
"I sigh ev'ry Monday thinkin' over Sunday.That one day when I'm with you.It seems that I sigh every Tuesday and I cry all day Wednesday.Oh, my, how I long for you.And then comes Thursday.Gee, it's long and never goes by.Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die.But after payday is my fun day, 'cuz I fall all day Sunday.That one day when I'm with you.And then comes Thursday.Gee, it's long and never goes by.Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die"
It's like reaching for the moon.It's like reaching for the sun.It's like reaching for the stars.Reaching for you.You're so far above me.How can I expect an angel to love me.Who is so divine as you are.It's like flying without wings.Playing fiddle without strings.And a million other things.No one can do.Though my hopes are slender.In my secret arms I pray you'll surrender.Though it's like reaching for the moon
Three little words.Oh what I'd give for that wonderful phrase.To hear those three little words.That's all I'd live for the rest of my days.And what I feel in my heart.They tell sincerely.No other words can tell it half so clear-early.Three little words.Eight little letters.Which simply mean I love you-ou.And what I feel in my heart.They tell sincerely.No other words can tell it half so clear-early.Three little words.Eight little letters.Which simply mean I love you.Simply mean I-I love you-ou
"I took a trip on a train.And I thought about you.I passed a shadowy lane.And I thought about you.Two or three cars parked under the stars.Winding stream.Moon shining down on some little town.And with each beam, the same old dream.And every stop that we made.Oh, I thought about you.And when I pulled down the shade.Then I really felt blue.I peeped through the crack.Looked at the track.Oh I'm going back to you.And what did I do? I thought about you.There were two or three cars parked under the stars.Winding stream.Moon shining down on some little town.And with each beam, the same old dream.And then I peeped through the crack.And looked at the track.Oh I'm going back to you.And what did I do? I thought about you"
