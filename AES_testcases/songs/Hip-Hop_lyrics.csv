"We're sitting here with Eazy E.Believe that.How are you doing?.All right.So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?.Ruthless, my style as a juvenile.Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile.Bankin' , I specialized in gankin.whites, Mexicans, brothers and others.Daily, it's all about comin' up.Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up.Because I'm a gangster havin fun).Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton.Terrible, I never listened to my mother.It went in one ear, and out the other.Ran my gang, sold undercover.Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover.I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar.At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala.Rollin, and runnin' from the police.Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief.or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal.Leave your car open, gank for your stereo.Hard and raw, no regard for the law.(Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?).Hell no!

I'm sorry for that verse.It's in my nature, I gotta curse.out anybody gettin' on my nerves.You get beat, ganked, broke and served.So you know who I am.and if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn.Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?.Sometimes.Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?.Wait for some people to leave.I got another trick up my sleeve.Step with pep to the back of the house.Look then all the lights are out.Grabbed the door and it's locked, so.easily made my way to the window.Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing.Looked around, and then I climbed in.Once inside, I start takin'.Cause you know it's no time for shakin.Get what you gonna get, front and center.or get five years for breakin and enter.Move quickly, but no runnin'.Shht, I think somebody's comin'.Hear the front door key, and I flee.out the back door with a fist full of jewelry.Over the wall don't fall.Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call.gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson.So is there any more questions?.Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?.You mean a two hundred eleven ?.Yeah.There's a store, but don't point.Walk inside, case the joint.One man behind the counter, another in the back.Go out to the car and load the gat.Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task.Go in broke, come out with cash.(Were you slick?).Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'.Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'.Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery"".Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby.Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag.I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags.The man in the back had a camera.so he came out to test his stamina.against Eazy E, but he took one.Fell to the floor, so I ran.back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it"".Took the gun, and then dumped it.I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more.Steal from the rich, hang with the poor.My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me.I feel like nobody is badder than me.(Is all that true ?).I don't lie.You see I'm not mister nice guy.Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?.Not exactly.And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?.Bad and bold, you can't get with this.Those that tried, you're on my hit list.Can't be caught, sought or fought.thought, and damn so what?.Down and dirty from the C-P-T.N-W-A and Eazy-E.One more, before we end this session.(What's your real name?).No more questions!"

"Let me tell you a little story about the slave master.Use a whip on your ass so you behave faster.You got chains on your neck and the man's respect.You'll work all damn day but you will never see a check in the field.Cotton you yield, your skin peels off your back.From the crack of the whip, it won't heal.Ya wish, you had a shield 'cause he wields iron.So when you act up, he smokes ya and keeps firing and it's tiring.Forget about recreation.One wrong move and it's death you're facing.White mothafuckaz got the ball and chain.On your leg and in the form of religion on your brain.They say, you the devil, you say, who the devil?.Some of us was house niggers, some of us was rebels.Some tried to get along the best they could.And didn't nobody use the phrase, it's all good, would you?.They got you living like a shrew.They throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards then you make a stew.They give us a white Jesus to appease us.We talk among ourselves and hope nobody sees us.They had our brothers beating us, called us creations.Plus monkeys, they just junkies mistreating us.The master said, ""If you don't whip 'em, you're dead"".It was fucking with his head but he beat us instead and we bled.Red blood flowing like a flood.Then he'd rape your mother stick her face in the mud.They were ruthless! If you tried to front, you'd be toothless.Some tried to run even though it seemed useless.Virginity was torn, soon babies was born.That was half white and now his skin is kind of light.You think you're special, because they let you oversee the carnage?.But I bet you will get hung, even if you stick out your tongue.'Cause they pull out the shank and stick it right through your lung.Now it's 96 and white people say, forget it, it's all in the past.And some even regret it 'cause they think we'll set it.Now my missions to get federal.So I can raise a black family with a true devil.And you know how that goes.The slave master watching over you.Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do.The slave master watching over you.But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew.The slave master watching over you.Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do.The slave master watching over you.But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew.This is for you kids trying to get signed.Just a little something you should keep in mind.The labels are slave masters, artists are slaves.Don't get too raunchy, they want you to behave.You get signed, you're thinking this is great.But wait you never knew what was at stake.Creative control they withhold, you sell your soul.When you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold.But you'll never see that, not without promotion.The label'll just throw your shit out and got it floatin'.You think your shit is potent but ain't nobody buying it.If they ain't never heard of it, ain't nobody trying it.If they ain't never heard of it, your record' they murder it.You can complain but they are not concerned a bit.'Cause when they signed you, they thought you'd make a hit.'Cause of who you were affiliated with and all that bullshit.Frustrations, all these rules and regulations.Just so you can have your shit heard by the nation and be patient.'Cause by the time they find a lead release, your shit is ancient.You think they're working your album? You're mistaken.And if you flop, you get dropped, 'cause you ain't the star.You didn't go pop, just straight up hip hop, time to get a mop.'Cause without no promotion, of course sales drop.Peep the break down if tapes cost ten.You'll probably only get to see a dollar in the end.That you cannot spend 'cause your budget gets recouped.So you never get cash unless your record is shoop.You better hope you get shows, which will not happen.If you don't have a record that's the main attraction.Even if you sell a million, you'll get burned.'Cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns.For a while, you wonder why rappers don't smile.'Cause to them, you're not an artist, you're just another file.Another nigger used to make another buck.They don't give a fuck and if your shit don't blow up, tough.But the star gets both promotion and devotion.From the whole fucking staff, at you, they laugh.The star probably don't know that he the house nigger.Thinking he bigger 'cause he's the, pick of the litter.These labels think backwards.They push the acts that need it the least.So they can get all the money they can when it's released.They take you to a restaurant for a feast.And then expect you to pick up the check?.That's why I give props to niggaz who is independent.'Cause they make they own money, plus decide how to spend it.Splendid and lets end it and don't get offended.The slave master watching over you.Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do.The slave master watching over you.But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew.The slave master watching over you.Always trying to tell you what the fuck to do.The slave master watching over you.But ain't nothing gonna stop me and my crew.Hieroglyphics"

"I'm chocolate like a bar but my name is not Roseanne.My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan.I plan to grow dreads but first a nappy fro.The longer the hair, the easier to scare a foe.It grows from my head until it covers up my face.People look and stare when I walk into the place.This is just a taste from the Funky Human Being.Ain't no misbehavin', ain't no use for ravin'.Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back.My skin is really brown even though it's labeled black.Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandanas.Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta.I chiseled up a sculpture to complement my culture.Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers.Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways.For this is how I like to spend my days, and it pays.To steal a groovy sample form the archives.Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid.Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes.Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs.""Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it"".I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby.I utilize a sample that I salvaged from the 60's cause I'm picky.My meal must appeal to me like Morris.Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest.I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes.Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose.I suppose they will bite, they'll try not to show it.I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded.I ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ.Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper.He will use his clippers to give himself a fade.I give my fro a sheen with a smidgen of Pomade.I laid in the shade and I greeted mixel place.With a rhythm and a rhyme and he said that it's a twist.From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that RnB and rap makes a winner.Guess who's comin' through for dinner.A native-like brother with the passive little style.That most certainly will smother.Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes.I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze.And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune.I'm the Funky Human Being not a monkey or a coon.Assume that the style is Funkadelic in the 90's.Del is livin' phat as I leave a foe behind me.""Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it"""

"Fun, even funner.I'm the gunner sub-machine gun.It don't seem right, that they don't get my theme right.They don't know me,.So we move forward.More words & phrases.My style amazes.Come into the scene with the means to rip shit.My brain's power packed with the proper equipment.So step.I come inta the area to bury ya.I compose the flows.Makin' people merrier.Never the less, I sever the flesh.With a razor.Reserve the major beef.I'ma slay ya, hey.You never came across a person like me.I never instigate.First come strike me.Then I'll flip.And rip clothing, and I'm loathing.MCs who front like I don't know things.Uh uh.Check again.I get wreck again.On the down low.Because you sound slow.Retarded MCs get neglected.& check it.Anytime I hafta show a foe.I'ma flex it.Then I exit.With my records & my next shit.Prepared, so be scared.I strike unexpected.I write rhymes in sections.Testin' my slang.I bang MCs with these.& make 'em hang.Dangle, what's ya angle?.When I strangle and choke.I hold Bennedicts by their throat.Until they sing notes like a canary.Fairy, or genies.We slipped out.They never seen me bust his face.I like bass when it hums.And that sums up my properties for the dumb-dums.Someone need to check him.Deck him.Slam him.And put him in the bushes.So 'shush' kids.No one needs to know.I'll proceed & go into.And then tell ya what I've been through..[CHORUS:].""In one ear, right out the other,.Go tell ya sister, go tell ya mother,.In one ear, right out the other,.Go tell ya father, go tell ya brother,.In one ear, right out the other."".I would feel comfortable.If your front would go elsewhere.Or disappear.Hear my specific style that's speaking.Creeking, making noises in the nightime.When I write rhymes.I look out my window.It's a bright day.And I might display my skills in the hills.Or, in a different neighborhood.Cause my flavor could.Be the best, so lets test this.Yes, bitch.I saw you posted at the pool table.I could never talk to you.But now a fool's able.With the best of luck.And, hey, how do you impress a duck?.By pullin' out a wad of bucks.Shucks.I need to stop this.I plop this, played this.I murder MCs.& leave their pens inkless.Do you think this is a twist.A turn, I insist.To burn those foes who haven't learned.To keep they mouths closed.Guinness Stout flows.Through your intestines, when life is depressin'.I built my foundation using patients.Some didn't hear us.Some had to state it....[CHORUS]"
"What's happening? I keep my dreadlocks in a napkin ring.Rap and sing Unlike the homogeneous clones.I'm into earth tones, birth stones and erogenous zones.The more ticklish the more you have.Sitting on the curb of what used to be the burbs.And before that was Canarcie, I'm a disturbed and bitter herb.Like saltwater and parsley, mics crawl up, tights fall down.That's my mnemonic voice stalactite slash stalagmite.You may have this Maglite, it survived the apocalypse.And for the fragile force of an agile horse.Here's a handful of very special chocolate chips"
"Get your lazy butt up off my couch.It seems nowadays friends step to me bogus.And end up on my couch at night without notice.It's cool to have a friend over every.Now and then but I gotta have my space.And I don't wanna see their face.Like every single day of the week, talk is cheap.You betta find yourself another place to sleep.It ain't my fault that ya moms got fed up.And now you wanna come to my crib and wet my bed up.You better find a job so you can get an apartment.And you can save your crocodile tears don't even start with.The sob stories I got enough from the other.Seven brothas in the den playin' genesis.Damn I can't win at this.Seems like I'm gonna have to flip.And tell those other brothas that they're gonna have to skip.I've had it up to here with these lazy cats.They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that.Get your lazy butt up off my couch.People come to my house and kinda wonder where the squadron's at.They're not gone, they're just down at the laundromat.Because they wear the same pairs of clothing.I'm taking up crazy patience just holding my temper.I'm about to start charging rent for.Every single brother that kicked it with my mother eating.Biscuits on saturday morning like a family.The minute they step it's like moms is crazy mad at me.Cause they're in my mother's room watching television.I feel like giving 'em the boot and say the hell with 'em.But if I give 'em the boot I'm not a friend though.Even though my room smells like dime bags of indo.But I can't pretend like I haven't been peepin' it.Even mom knows that my brothas been sleepin' on.My couch for weeks so your speeches fall flat.They keep sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that.Get your lazy butt up off my couch.Maybe this was just my upbringing perhaps.But I was taught that I shouldn't take seven day naps.At other brothas' cribs like I don't have a home.Brothas on my couch so much there's like foam.Coming out the seams and a pair of jeans.Is missing from my closet, I wonder why I even bother being friendly.They're running my ass like the indy 5000.They went and wrinkled my mother's blouse.When they snuck downstairs for a midnight snack.And ate the last slice of bread and a box of apple jacks.Then they hit the sack with the stereo blastin'.And even little tyson is fed up, so I'm askin'.You all to jet, before I get upset.And throw each and every one of you bums out on your back.My house is a mess, so step ya little pest.Who was sleepin' on my couch cause I'm tired of that.Get your lazy butt up off my couch"
"I'm ready for action, packing provisions of visions.Verbally, every word will be enhanced.With the bass that'll put you in a trance.Some dance, come take a chance.Del won't do you wrong.I've been in the rap game too long to falter.I rock like Gibraltar.Make you kneel to the butt like an altar.We move to prove that this is improved, when you're at-water.Caught em with vibration that soothes your back like massages.Before you can park your car in garages.It'll be just for riders, listening to 'Rock The Bells'.You can barely hear the vocals.Mixing is important, getting the public into chokeholds.Hip hop homo's will do well to know this.It ain't about who's the dopest.It's who gets the fan's focus upon you.When they feel what the song do.I think I'm onto something, when I got my shit pumping.I remember, when they were satisfied with just lyrics.Now, if the music 's flat.I can barely stand to hear it.And my rhymes are impeccable and you can't dissect my flow.With music sounding like it's out of tin cans.Just wretch the whole vibe and stride for perfection.Why you think they call this a profession? Hey.[Chorus: x2].Can't forget the bass, the bottom got em crawling to the wall man.We got cassettes, CD's and LP's.DJ's for days, whatever you do.Give it your all, cause that's what pays.I just love when I can hear the bump pleading to the walls.In the halls, coming from the record stores in the malls.A beat with walls I like that.It bites back and strikes back.At niggaz who are wack, 'cause.Back in the day when hip hop was just developing.It was back in the day.We should be relishing in experience.All you newcomers better be leery cause.Hieroglyphics got the bump.And it ain't mysterious.[Chorus].This don't apply to the niggaz who salved.And fell out of their fam base.Trying to chase the big bucks.It sucks, I know, when your heroes want to appear to hoes.Supermacho! And watch the whole role and image of a mic champion.To the fam base it simply can't be done.'Cause they're your folks when you don't get the prop shit.They know you got the top shit and in it only for profit.But since we on the topic, let me drop it.We need to stop this segregation of hip hop.Talking 'bout fuck the east coast, and fuck the west.He's sold out, cause someone either sings a notion in the chorus.What is real hip hop then? Only the shit you listen to.Everything else pretending, I'm sending a message to my fam base.Fuck this is hip hop and this is rap, it came from the same place.And there's a place for everything including hieroglyphics.And we gonna come with it, as long as y'all with it.'Cause the fam base is like a legion.For one cause, we want the dope shit cause.The other got flossed ??? Now.I'm a fan who likes a lot of different things.I differentiate with music just to spread my wings.I always do my best, that's why the fans love me.Not some crime shit, so I can pop bubbly.We all got some preferences, that's just how it goes.But when you see there's an effort being made, don't turn up your nose.Turn up the bass, race to go and buy it.Some of y'all love it - don't you, don't deny it.[Chorus]"

"They say that nice guys finish last, but I'm the leader.Drinkin' liters of Seagrams with the heathens.Misbehave and break the buzz, fuck the shavings.Collectin' scratch for my savings before the day ends.Cravings for music, collaborate at a rate.Faster than the speed of sound to go thataway.No replicas, step to us, I guess the job was left to us.To kick the phonics that kept you buzzed.And perkin', workin' words, distributin' herbs.To niggas livin' in 'burbs cause they too petro.To come to the ghetto.Mind you, all we do is find you, wave and gave you a sack.Come back but watch 50, they try to lift me.Off the tracks but we ain't offerin crack, just bomb.No need for alarm or bad karma, but arm yourself.Move in stealth, wealth is accumulated.Pockets are illuminated.I make the shit I think hit even though some assume you hate it.I pass judgment when the fuzz lit, take a shit.Just another skit comin' from the pit of Babylon.But powerful like Alvatron.From the Decepticons.Music is magical like a leprechaun.Kept you on point in many different sectors.On Elektra, make you remember Medgar Evers and James Evers.My skills sent from the heavens.I wish they sold Maddog at 7-11.I remember when niggas wore Thriller jackets.And Starter jackets and harder tactics.Had been adopted and most of y'all mocked it.But put a sock in it for a minute.I provide the funk and y'all rock with it.As I spit it, admit it, oh shit.[Chorus].It's Del the Funky Homosapien.Goin' from town to town to town and just makin' friends.Reach out and shaking hands.With the public and they love it.No technical difficulties or faultiness, you salt me with.That plain-Jane-no-game-insane-to-the-brain.Don't need cocaine fuckin' with the A.The A-Pluster plus the A from way back in the day.For mind expansion enhancing thoughts.I'm raw with savagery, the majesty of all in vision.Wait, but isn't this a good way to start?.Developin' art to cart scrill to kill Satan.Plans for gettin' Daytons are past tense.Stack ends so I won't be a has-been (You know it).The question you been askin: Is Del that masked man?.Rollin through our cities just rippin' major venues.Like Whitney Houston like when I went to Houston.My father is from Texas, so next bust a rhyme for times.I felt it was no hope, but no factors you formulate.Made me foster hatred and made me want to make it.When I'm in the Bay niggas say (Del, how you doin, man?).I ain't no rap star that act hard, can't speak.I leak lyrics, freak lyrics, secrete lyrics.From my spirits.Tyranny for all who hear of me.Bomb in a bong, my feet in a thong.On a beach with a biatch named Bonbon.Called her on the Intercong, enter John Owens.Better known as Casual to y'all not knowin'.About flowin, cause your rhymes are all stolen.Another dip on the strip cause task force patrollin'.But rollin' blunts too fat to measure.Mexico's national treasure for pleasure.Resurrect tracks like this from my childhood.Before it was such a wild hood.Knock on wood.[Chorus].My beats are meaty.Let's call a peace treaty.And stick to it.I'm quick to do it, are you?.So much funk you can't kick it with my crew.Other than when it's time to get blue?.(Shame on you).I want me a girl that's intelligent.Doin' shit and ain't too belligerent.Picture it, chillin' backyard barbecue.Not trippin' off what niggas are to you.Jealousy, well let's see.It's a lot of that in Oakland.It started when niggas started smokin'.And snortin' hop, fuck pop.I want the melodies.But not the weak topics you are selling me.Del is free of confinements.My mind bendin' fragile and frazzled.I choose to stay underground like Fraggles.In battles I'm sure to win.While you smoke bud I drink gin.It sinks in while everyone else act on it.I macked on it but not too far from redrum.Don't push me, I'm not a pussy.I wish we could gather at a function, drink some lager.And just bust hymns of funk and flav.'Cause the slaves that are our ancestors.Would feel blessed if we did that.Before we hear rap.Now it's American children syntax.Ever since it been on wax.And that's the facts, believe it, don't mislead it.And don't do the shit if you don't need it.And that's real, you might not be but I am.The truth's gonna slap you in the face, so why scam?.[Chorus]"
"The same ol' thing (all over the world).The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it).The same ol' thing (MCs out there got).The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it).MCs keep comin' with the same ol' thing.With the same ol' swing, with the same ol' ending.The same ol' climax cause many have no vertebrae.Yo, but D-E-L and Hieroglyphics have to murder a.Fraudulent foe real quick and get them off of our dicks.Show the public that they ass ain't slick.They lack skills and they can only thrill ya by dance steps.I coulda iced Vanilla, but I haven't got the chance yet.But that's okay cause he was dissed on Soul Train.He got booed because his rhymes are so lame.He ain't the only one, he's far from it.There's more on Earth and they're all gonna plummet.Like falling stars because a brother's in charge.I'mma stomp mud holes in they ass like they was El DeBarge.Then charge to the front of the class.Suckers everywhere like broken glass, yo.But I'mma keep troopin' through the Meadow with the fellow.Named X and a pillow, to sock the pussy willows.While I get dough as I grow as a rhymer.And they can keep showin' their teeth like Aunt Jemima.It's the same ol' thing.The same ol' thing (all over the world).The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it).The same ol' thing (MCs out there got).The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it).The same ol' thing (all over the world).The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it).The same ol' thing (MCs out there got).The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it).I'm in your face with force to eliminate monotonous.Braggin' and boastin', so most will end up profitless.Cause they ain't got a foot to stand on.And I'mma leave the stage bloodier than a tampon.I can't get no rest because of gamin' little pests.Will step and try to test me with the same ol' thing.I wish it would stop but more than likely it will not.Cause too many MCs got the same ol' thing.So I change and rearrange rhyme patterns.Keep ya mind scatterin'.From the solar system.And I still dissed 'em.The ones with the crumbs on they lips.Talkin' about Sucka MCs that don't exist.And I get the gist so don't play me like a imbecile.Thinkin' that ya large, but ya small as a thimble.Plus I get mental over funky tracks.And ya still talkin' Sucka MC's? That shit is wack.If I ever dissed an MC it was one with a name.So don't tell me he was one in the same.Because I know better, I flow better than the average Joe.I use my Nubian stick to overthrow.That same ol' thing.The same ol' thing (all over the world).The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it).The same ol' thing (MCs out there got).The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it).The same ol' thing (all over the world).The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it).The same ol' thing (MCs out there got).The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it).MC's out there got the same ol' thing, got the same ol' game.And trip, some got the same ol' name.Like Rockmaster This, Mighty Kingathat.Who died and left you the Wolfman, Jack?.But the Boogiemen are irregular.Spectacular, Dracula, and plus we're gettin' clever.I never had the urge to ass a tag to my title.And I won't add a (rah) or a (huh) at the end of my recital.Hip hop hibbit.I never say a rhyme like that cause I can take my time and give it.Thought.So I went and bought.A pen and pad.Now I'm makin' MCs real mad.Like Young MC goin' out like Sugar Hill.Add a new beat, new rhyme, bogus still.And even if we are in the same gang it ain't no need.For all MC's to have the same ol' thing.The same ol' thing (all over the world).The same ol' thing (got to get 'em with it).The same ol' thing (MCs out there got).The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya bout it).And it's gettin' mighty ancient"
