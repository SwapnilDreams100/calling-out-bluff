"Rise and fall, like the tide.My hand goes with your chest.Steady now, moon will pull.A slow and even breath.Outa the blue, the storm rolls in.I see it in your eyes.Thunder strikes, but I will be.A place for you to hide.Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves.The highest point is just before it breaks.I will light a candle for you welcoming.Baby, come home to me.Night moves in.And you can't see, a star up in the sky.Let my voice anchor you.I promise the sun will rise.Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves.The highest point is just before it breaks.I will light a candle for you welcoming.Baby, come home to me.I am standing, on the shore.I am holding a light.I am standing, on the shore.I am holding a light.I am standing, on the shore.I am holding a light.I am standing, on the shore.I am holding.You're heart rises and it falls.Just before it breaks.I will light a candle.Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves.The highest point is just before it breaks.I will light a candle for you welcoming.Baby, come home to me.Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves.The highest point is just before it breaks.I will light a candle for you welcoming.Baby, come home to me.Baby, come home to me.Baby, come home to me"
"It's morning o'er the Islands I love.And wild seas lie still, deep and blue.Though life has sent me troubles, I'll feel no pain.If I never spend a morning without you.If I never spend a morning without you.When hope was an ocean-pounding heart.Then love was the ship that carried me through.And now I've reached my Island I'll find peace again.If I never spend a morning without you.If I never spend a morning without you.Old the land, older its people. But the promise of new life is still.the victor o'er decay. Hold the dream, pass by the stranger,.He can never call this land his home.Nor wish the truth away..With the honesty of fire light on your face.We while away the hours as lovers do.At the closing of the evening I will ask no more.If I never spend a morning without you.If I never spend a morning without you.Old the land, older its people. But the promise of new life is still.the victor o'er decay. Hold the dream, pass by the stranger,.He can never call this land his home.Nor wish the truth away..Though tomorrow is still no more than dreams.It's yesterday that gives me strength to do.For the hardest roads will run like silk to me,.it seems..If I never spend a morning without you.If I never spend a morning without you"

"Ah me, I must mourn my true love evermore.Though coldly forsaken, it's you adore.And if you'd return then I'd make you my bride.Or I'd cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side.On the morning we parted, how sad the farewell.Our words, they were few, but our thoughts none could tell.And when lost to my vision far over the brine.I drank your success in a goblet of wine.Three times have I crossed to the ship as she lay.Becalmed on the breast of the silvery bay.And my crew are the bravest ever handled an oar.And not by the tempest, they laugh at its roar.No ballroom can tempt me nor raise my dispair.For there none in the dance that with you can compare.And to watch the young lovers as they swing 'round the floor.Brings tears to these eyes that may see you no more.And in beauty there's none with this lady could buy.She's as pure as the stars and the blue of the sky.She's as fair as a lily and as sweet as a rose.And there's nothing can tempt me, her name to disclose.No drink will I take for to lighten my heart.But the wildest adventures I'll take for my part.No women on earth will I have for a bride.'Til I cross the wild Atlantic to be your side.Ah me, I must mourn my true love evermore.Though coldly forsaken, it's you adore.And if you'd return then I'd make you my bride.Or I'll cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side"

"Pity the fate of a poor Irish stranger,.That wanders so far from his home,.That sighs for protection from want, woe, and danger,.That knows not from which way for to roam..Yet I'll never return to Hibernia's green bowers,.For tyranny tramples the sweetest of flowers,.That once gave me comfort in loneliest hours.Now they are gone I shall ne'er see them more..With wonder I gazed on yon lofty building,.As in grandeur I rose from its lord,.But soon I beheld my fair garden yielding.The choicest of fruit for his foe..But, where is my father's lone cottage of clay,.Wherein I' ve spent many a long day,.Alas ! has his lordship conniv'd it away ?.Yes, it is gone, I shall never see it more..When nature was seen in the sloe bush and bramble,.All smiling in beautiful bloom,.Over the fields without danger, I often.Did ramble amidst their perfume ;.I have wranged through the woods where the gay feather'd.throng.Joyfully sung their loud echoing song.These days then of summer passed sweetly along,.Now they're goneI shall ne'er see them more !.When the sloe and the berries hung ripe on the bushes.I have gathered them off without harm.I have gone to the field and shorn the green rushes,.Preparing for winter's cold storm !.Along with my friends telling tales of delight,.Beguiling the hours of the long winter's night,.Those days gave me pleasureI could them invite ;.Now they're gone, I shall ne'er see them more."
"There was a lad was born in Kyle,.But whatna day o' whatna style,.I doubt it's hardly worth the while.To be sae nice wi' Robin..Chor. - Robin was a rovin' boy,.Rantin', rovin', rantin', rovin',.Robin was a rovin' boy,.Rantin', rovin', Robin!.Our monarch's hindmost year but ane.Was five-and-twenty days begun^2,.'Twas then a blast o' Janwar' win'.Blew hansel in on Robin..Robin was, &c..The gossip keekit in his loof,.Quo' scho, ""Wha lives will see the proof,.This waly boy will be nae coof:.I think we'll ca' him Robin."".Robin was, &c..""He'll hae misfortunes great an' sma',.But aye a heart aboon them a',.He'll be a credit till us a'-.We'll a' be proud o' Robin."".Robin was, &c..""But sure as three times three mak nine,.I see by ilka score and line,.This chap will dearly like our kin',.So leeze me on thee!

"Oh, there're sober men in plenty,.And drunkards barely twenty,.There are men of over ninety.That have never yet kissed a girl..But gie me a ramblin' rover,.And fae Orkney down to Dover..We will roam the country over.And together we'll face the world..There's many that feign enjoyment.From merciless employment,.Their ambition was this deployment.From the minute they left the school..And they save and scrape and ponder.While the rest go out and squander,.See the world and rove and wander.And are happier as a rule..I've roamed through all the nations.Ta'en delight in all creation,.And I've tried a wee sensation.Where the company, did prove kind..And when partin' was no pleasure,.I've drunk another measure.To the good friends that were treasure.For they always are in our minds..If you're bent wi' arth-i-ritis,.Your bowels have got colitis,.You've gallopin' with bollockitis.And you're thinkin' it's time you died,.If you been a man of action,.Though you're lying there in traction,.You will get some satisfaction.Thinkin', ""Jesus, at least I tried."""
"There was a fair young lady so lately I've been told.She lived with her uncle, the cause of all her woes;.Her uncle had a ploughboy, which Mollie liked quite well.And in her uncle's garden their tender love did tell..So early one morning this old man he arose.And at Mollie's room door he hastened on his clothes,.Saying, "" Arise you handsome female, and married you shall be.For the squire is a-waiting on the banks of sweet Dundee..""A fig to all your squires, to lord and Jews likewise,.For William 'pears like diamonds a-glittering in my eyes."".""You never shall have Willie, nor happy shall you be.For I mean to banish Willie from the banks of sweet Dundee."".The first crowd came on Willie when he was all alone,.He fought full hard for his liberty, but there were eight to one;.""Pray kill me now,"" says Willie, ""Pray kill me now,"" says he.""For I'd rather die for Mollie on the banks of sweet Dundee."".As Mollie was walking, lamenting for her love.She meets the wealthy squire, all in her uncle's grove..""Stand off, stand off!"" says Mollie, ""Stand off, you man,"" says she,.""For I'd rather die for Willie on the banks of sweet Dundee."".He threw his arms around her and crushed her to the ground,.There she spied two pistols and a sword beneath his morning-gown;.The pistols she slipped slyly, and the sword she used free.She shot and killed the squire on the banks of sweet Dundee..Her uncle overheard them, come hastening to the grove.Saying, ""You've killed the wealthy squire, prepare for your death-blow,"".""Stand off, stand off!"" says Mollie, ""Stand off, you man, says she,"".So the trigger drew and her uncle slew on the banks of sweet Dundee..The doctor being sent for, he knew that they were killed.Also there came a lawyer to write the old man's will..He willed his gold to Mollie, because she fought so free.Then closed his eyes to write no more on the banks of sweet Dundee"
"THERE came to the beach a poor exile of Erin..The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;.For his country he sighed, when at twilight reparing..To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill..But the day-star attracted his eyes' sad devotion,.For it rose o'er his own native isle of the ocean,.When once in the fire of his youthful emotion,.He sang the loud anthem of Erin-go-Bragh..""Sad is my fate!"" said the heart-broken stranger :.The wild-deer and wolf to a convert can flee..But I have no refuge from famine and danger-.A home and a country remain not to me..Never again, in the green sunny bowers,.Where my forefathers lived, shall I spend the sweet hours,.Or cover my harp with the wild-women flower,.And strike to the numbers of Erin-go-Bragh..""Erin, my country ! though sad and forsaken,.In dreams I revisit thy sea beaten shore:.But alas ! in a far foreign land I awaken,.And sigh for the friends who can meet me no more.O! cruel fate ! wilt thou never replace me.In a mansion of peace where no perils can chase me?.Never again shall my brothers embrace me..They died to defend me, or live to deplore..""Where is my cabin door, fast by the wild wood?.Sisters and sire, did you weep for its fall?.Where is the mother that looked on my childhood?.And where is the bosom friend dearer than all?.O! my sad heart! long abandoned by pleasure,.Why did it dote on fast-fading treasure?.Tears, like the rain-drops, may fall with-out measure,.But rapture and beauty they cannot recall."
"It being a fine morning, this young man he chose.That he'd make occasion to wear his fine clothes.And it's down to the glen where the bonnie lassie goes.To give her a token of his love, we suppose.""Mary, oh Mary, if I could be your man.Between you and danger I fearlessly would stand.With this gold claddagh ring on your lily-white hand.Oh, there ne'er was another would dress you so grand."".There's no sun in summer there's no flowers in spring.Her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring..""Johnny, oh Johnny the ring it is of gold.And it's hands and fine heart, they are lovely to behold.But if I had the ring for one evening to hold.Then you shall have my answer e'er the week shall be old."".""Oh why have the weeks gone and not an answer came ?.And why is it that women are smarter than men ?.Oh the girl's kept the ring which I shall ne'er see again.Oh, she has many like it in a fine box at hame."".There's no sun in summer there's no flowers in spring.Her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring..It being a fine morning, this young man he chose.That he'd make occasion to wear his fine clothes.And it's down to the glen where the bonnie lassie goes.To give her a token of his love, we suppose.There's no sun in summer there's no flowers in spring.Her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring..Oh, her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring."
"My darling, do not break your heart.Though I leave this Irish shore.Though their cruel laws may force us to part.Fate may join we two once more.Take this farewell kiss as a token.Of my love while far I stray.For true love will never be broken.Let me kiss your tears away.Like the rain, like the rain.When he turned his back to Donegal.Her tears fell like the rain.Don't let your eyes fill with sorrow, love.Don't wet your pretty cheeks with tears.There will come a bright new tomorrow, love.There will come an end to fears.Dark may seem our lives December.Time will bring to us the May.Love will guide me back remember.Let me kiss your tears away.Like the rain, like the rain.When he turned his back to Donegal.Her tears fell like the rain.Take this jewelled ring to wear, my love.While I am o'er the wave.Next my heart you know I will wear, my love.This lock of hair you gave.Kiss me once before we sever.For my safety say, you'll pray.You will be my dearest, forever, love.Let me kiss your tears away.Like the rain, just falling like the rain.When he turned his back to Donegal.Her tears fell like the rain.Like the rain, like the rain.When he turned his back to Donegal.His tears fell like the rain"
"I am a wand'ring minstrel man,.And Love my only theme,.I've stray'd beside the pleasant Bann,.And eke the Shannon's stream;.I've pip'd and play'd to wife and maid.By Barrow, Suir, and Nore,.But never met a maiden yet.Like Brighidin Ban Mo Store..My girl hath ringlets rich and rare,.By Nature's fingers wove -.Loch-Carra's swan is not so fair.As her breast of love;.And when she moves, in Sunday sheen,.Beyond our cottage door,.I'd scorn the high-born Saxon queen.For Brighidin Ban Mo Store..It is not that thy smile is sweet,.And soft thy voice of song -.It is not that thou fleest to meet.My comings lone and long;.But that doth rest beneath thy breast,.A heart of purest core,.Whose pulse is known to me alone,.My Brighidin Ban Mo Store!"
"I mourn for the Highlands, now drear and forsaken.The lands of my fathers the gallant and brave.To make room for the sportsmen, their lands were all taken.And they had to seek out new homes far away.Oh shame on the tyrants who brought desolation.Who banished the brave and put sheep in their place.Where once smiled the gardens rank weeds in their station.And deer are preferred to the leal-hearted braves.Oh where are the parents and bairns yonder rovin.The scene o' their gladness is far o'er the main.No blithe-hearted milk-maid now cheers at the gloaming.The herd-boy no longer seen on the plain.But the lark is still soaring; she sings in her glory.With no one to listen her sweet morning lay.The clansmen are gone, but their deeds live in story.Like chaff in the wind, they were borne far away"
"Ae fond kiss, and then we sever,.Ae fareweel, alas, for ever!.Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,.Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee..Who shall say that Fortune grieves him,.While the star of hope she leaves him?.Me, nae cheerful twinkle lights me;.Dark despair around benights me..I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,.Naething could resist my Nancy,.But to see her was to love her,.Love but her, and love for ever..Had we never lov'd sae kindly,.Had we never lov'd sae blindly,.Never met-or never parted,.We had ne'er been broken-hearted..Fare-thee-weel, thou first and fairest!.Fare-thee-weel, thou best and dearest!.Thine be ilka joy and treasure,.Peace, Enjoyment, Love and Pleasure!.Ae fond kiss, and then we sever!.Ae fareweeli alas, for ever!.Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,.Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee."
"Tho' women's minds, like winter winds,.May shift, and turn, an' a' that,.The noblest breast adores them maist-.A consequence I draw that..Chorus.For a' that, an' a' that,.And twice as meikle's a' that;.The bonie lass that I loe best.She'll be my ain for a' that..Great love I bear to a' the fair,.Their humble slave, an' a' that;.But lordly will, I hold it still.A mortal sin to thraw that..For a' that, &c.;.But there is ane aboon the lave,.Has wit, and sense, an' a' that;.A bonie lass, I like her best,.And wha a crime dare ca' that?.For a' that, &c.;.In rapture sweet this hour we meet,.Wi' mutual love an' a' that,.But for how lang the flie may stang,.Let inclination law that..For a' that, &c.;.Their tricks an' craft hae put me daft..They've taen me in, an' a' that;.But clear your decks, and here's-""The Sex!"".I like the jads for a' that..For a' that, &c.;"
THE HEART OF YOUR HOME.He still smiles when he recalls.How the gold ring fit her finger.And they made that moment linger.That it's memory'd be strong.They had made a brand new start.Found a whole new way of living.Two voices joined together.Singing no sad songs.When the hard times come around.May you see them through together.Let there be love and laughter.In the heart of your home.Leaving there was always hard.Leaving her was never easy.With those memories to tease you.Summer night's seemed winter's long.But in his heart there was a song.And the only sound worth hearing.Two voices joined together.Singing no sad songs
"I'm wearin' awa', Jean.Like snaw-wreaths in thaw, Jean.I'm wearin' awa'.To the land o' the Leal.There 's nae sorrow there, Jean.There 's neither cauld nor care, Jean.The day is aye fair.In the land o' the Leal.Ye, aye,were leal and true, Jean.Yer task is ended noo, Jean.And I'll welcome you.Tae the lan' o'the Leal.Our bonnie bairn 's there, Jean.She was baith gude and fair, Jean.And oh, we grudged her sair.To the land o' the Leal.So, dry that tearfull e'e, Jean.My saul langs to be free, Jean.And angels wait on me.To the land o' the Leal.Now fare-ye-weel, my ain Jean.This warld's cares are vain, Jean.We'll meet, and we'll be fain.In the land o' the Leal.I'm wearin' awa', Jean.Like snaw-wreaths in thaw, Jean.I'm wearin' awa'.To the land o' the Leal.There 's nae sorrow there, Jean.There 's neither cauld nor care, Jean.The day is aye fair.In the land o' the Leal"
"Wha will ride wi' gallant Murray.Wha will ride for Geordie's sel'.He's the flower o' Glen Isla.And the darlin' o' Dunkeld.See the white rose in his bonnet.See his banner o'er the Tay.His guid sword he now has drawn it.And has flung his sheath away.Every faithfu' Murray follows.First of heroes, best of men.Every true and trusty Stewart.Blythely leaves his native glen.Athol lads are lads of honour.Westland rogues are rebels a'.When we come within their border.We may gar the Campbell's claw.Menzies he's our friend and brother.Gask and Strowan are nae slack.Noble Perth has ta'en the field.And a' the Drummonds at his back.Let us ride wi' gallant Murray.Let us fight for Charlie's crown.From the right we'll never sinder.Til we bring the tyrants down.MacIntosh the gallant sodger.Wi' the Grahams and Gordons gay.They have ta'en the field of honour.Spite of all their chiefs could say.Point the musket Bend the rapier.Shift the brog for Lowland shoe.Scour the durk and face the danger.MacIntosh has all to do"
"There's many who talk of Freedom.And we have some it's true.But if you think it's fairly shared around.Then you don't have a clue,.No you just don't have a clue..Freedom oh Freedom while men are bought and sold.You're free if you've plenty of money boys.For freedom is like gold. Freedom is like gold..She's young and she's a mother.Her man is out on the town.Her life reads like a lousy book.But she can't put it down.No, she just can't put it down..Apartheid in South Africa.Is everything that's vile.In this land of inequality.Slavery's in style.Slavery's in style..Have you ever been in CND..And are you a union man?.If you stood at the Mine in the picket line.You may never work again..You may never work again..And the rich folk they have plenty.While the poor folk they have none.But who must die when the bullets fly?.It's the poor man and his son.The poor man and his son."
"My heart was ance as blithe and free.As simmer days were lang,.But a bonie, westlin' weaver lad.Has gart me change my sang..To the weaver's gin ye go, fair maids,.To the weaver's gin ye go,.I rede you right, gang ne'er at night,.To the weaver's gin ye go..My mither sent me to the town,.To warp a plaiden wab,.But the weary, weary warpin o't.Has gart me sigh and sab..To the weaver's..A bonie, westlin weaver lad.Sat working at his loom;.He took my heart as wi' a net,.In every knot and thrum..To the weaver's.I sat beside my warpin-wheel,.And aye I ca'd it roun';.But every shot and evey knock,.My heart it gae a stoun..To the weaver's.The moon was sinking in the west,.Wi' visage pale and wan,.As my bonie, westlin weaver lad.Convoy'd me thro' the glen..To the weaver's.But what was said, or what was done,.Shame fa' me gin I tell;.But Oh! I fear the kintra soon.Will ken as weel's myself!.To the weaver's"
"Where are you tonight I wonder.And where will you be tonight when I cry?.Will sleep for you come easy,.Though I alone can't slumber.Will you welcome in the morning.At another man's side?.How easy for you the years slipped under.And left me a shadow the sun can't dispel.I built for you a tower of love and admiration.But I set you so high I could not reach myself..I look through my window at a world filled with strangers.The face in my mirror is the one face I know.You have taken all that's in me, so my heart is in no danger.My heart is in no danger, but I'd still like to know.If there is a silence then it can be broken.If there beats a pure heart to her I will go.And time will work its healing and the spirit will grow stronger.Ah, but in the meantime I'd still like to know."
"Have you seen him on the corner.And his lip would reach the pavement..He's been hiding from his razor,.Is he not an awful sight?.In love he was the purist,.How he's frightening our tourists..If he'd gone and asked his father.Oh, I'm sure he'd set him right, sayin'.""Take her in your arms.And tell her that you love her,.Take her in your arms.And hold that woman tight..Won't you take her in your arms.And tell her that you love her..If you're going to love a woman.Then be sure you do it right."".Now he met her at a disco.In a dive in San Francisco.And it all might have been different.Had he seen her in daylight..She was painted, she was scented,.But she drove your man demented.If he'd gone and asked his father.Oh, I'm sure he'd set him right, sayin'.Here's a pub with fun and laughter.The landlord's buying bevvy..There's a session in the corner.And the crack is grand tonight,.But your man who's lost his woman,.He's still at home lamenting..If he'd gone and asked his father.Oh, I'm sure he'd set him right, sayin'.Now, depression's not a million laughs.But suicide's too dangerous..Don't go leppin' out of buildings.In the middle of the night..It's not the fall --- but landin'.That'll alter social standin'.So go first and ask your father.Oh, I'm sure he'll set you right, sayin'.Here's a health to all true lovers,.Their sisters and their brothers,.And their uncles and their grannies,.For this thing is black and white..If you're keen to start romancin'.With its leppin' and its dancin'.Then go first and ask your father.And I'm sure he'll set you right, sayin'"

"I am a ramblin' Irishman.It's Ulster I was born in.And manys the happy hour I spent.On the banks of sweet Loch Erin.Ah but to live poor I could not endure.Like others of my station.To America I sailed away.And left this Irish nation.Rie tan tah na nah tan tan na nah.rie tan tan a noo tan a tan deh.The night before I went away.I spent it with my darlin.From 2 o'clock in the afternoon.Til the break of day next morning.And when that we were going for to part.We linked in each other's arm.And you may be sure, ah and very very sure.It's wounded both her charms.Rie.....The very first night I spent on board.I dreamt about my Nancy.I dreamt I held her in my arms.And it's well she pleased my fancy.Ah, but in the morning when I awoke.And I found my bosom empty.Ah you may be sure, and very very sure.That I lay discontented.Rie.....Ah but when we reached the other side.We both stout and healthy.We dropped our anchor in the bay.Going down to Philadelphie.Let every lass link with her lad.Blue jacket and white trousers.Let every lad link with his lass.Blue petticoat and white blousers.Tan tan na nah..... (repeat first verse...)"

"Oh, what a parish, a terrible parish;.Oh, what a parish is that o' Dunkeld..They hangit their minister, droon'd their precentor,.Dang doun the steeple and fuddled the bell..The steeple was doun but the kirk was still staunin',.They biggit a lum whaur the bell used to hang..A stell-pat they gat and they brewed Hielan' whisky;.On Sundays they drank it and ranted and sang..O, had you but seen how graceful it lookit,.To see the crammed pews sae socially joined..MacDonald the piper stood up in the poopit,.He made the pipes skirl out the music divine..Wi' whiskey and beer they'd curse and they'd swear;.They'd argue and fecht what ye daurna weel tell..Bout Geordie and Charlie they bothered fu' rarely.Wi' whisky they're worse than the devil himsel'..When the hairt-cheerin' spirit had mounted their garret,.Tae a ball on the green they a' did adjourn..The maids wi' coats kilted, they skippit and liltit,.When tired they shook hands and then hame did return..If the kirks a' owre Scotland held like social meetin's.Nae warnin' ye'd need from a far-tinklin' bell,.For true love and friends wad draw ye thegither.Far better than roarin' the horrors o' hell."
"There was a lord, lived in this town.Who had a handsome, lovely daughter..She was courted by a fair young man.Who was a servant to her father..But when her parents they came to know.They swore theyd send him from the island..The maid she knew her heart would break.Had she to part with young Matt Hyland..Then straightway unto her love she goes,.Into his room him to awaken..Saying, arise my love, and go away,.This very night you will be taken..I overheard my parents say.In spite of me he will transport you..So arise, my love, and go away,.I wish to God Id gone before you..Oh must I go, to her he said,.Oh must I go without my wages..Without one penny allin my purse.Just like some poor, forlorn stranger.Heres fifty guineas all in bright gold.And thats far more than father owes you..So take it now and go away,.I wish to God Id gone before you..They both sat down upon the bed.Just for the side of one half hour,.Not a word did either speak,.But down their cheeks the tears did shower..She rests her head upon his breast.And round his neck her arms entwined..Not duke nor lord, nor earl Ill wed.Ill wait for thee my own Matt Hyland..Ill wait for thee my own Matt Hyland..Ill wait for thee my own Matt Hyland."
"My name is Patrick Sheehan, and my years are thirty-four;.Tipperary is my native place, not far from Galtymore;.I came of honest parents, but now they're lying low;.Though' many's the pleasant days we spent in the Glen of Aherlow..My father died; I closed his eyes, outside the cabin door;.For the landlord and the sheriff too, were there the day before,.And then my lovin' mother, and my sisters three, also,.Were forced to go with broken hearts, from the Glen of Aherlow.For three long months, in search of work, I wandered far and near;.I then went to the poorhouse to see my mother dear;.The news I heard near broke my heart, but still in all my woe,.I blessed the friends who made their graves in the Glen of Aherlow..Bereft of home and kith and kin, with plenty all around,.I starved within my cabin, and slept upon the ground;.But cruel as my lot was, I never did hardship know,.Till I joined the English army, far away from Aherlow..""Rouse up there,"" cried the corporal, ""Ya lazy Irish hound!.Why don't you hear the bugle, its call to arms to sound? "".I found I had been dreaming of the days long, long ago,.And I woke upon Sebastopol, and not in Aherlow.I tried to find my musket, how dark I thought the night!.O blessed God! It wasn't dark, it was the broad daylight!.And when I found that I was blind, my tears began to flow,.And I longed for even a pauper's grave in the Glen of Aherlow..A poor neglected mendicant, I wander Dublin's streets.My nine months' pension it being out, I beg from all I meet;.As I joined my country's tyrants, my face I can never show,.Amongst my dear old neighbors in the Glen of Aherlow..So Irish youths, dear countrymen, take heed in what I say;.For if you join the English ranks, you'll surely rue the day.And whenever you're tempted, a-soldiering to go..Remember poor blind Sheehan from the Glen of Aherlow."
"Let your quacks and newspapers be cutting their capers.About curing the vapors the scratch and the gout.With their medical potions, their serums and their lotions.Upholding their notions, they're mighty put out..Who can tell the true physic to all that's pathetic.And pitch to the divil, cramp, colic and spleen.You'll know it I think if you take a big drink.With your mouth to the brink of a jug of poteen.So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature.For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys.Oh what botheration, no dose in the nation.Can give consolation like poteen me boys..No liquid cosmetic to lovers athletic.Or bodies pathetic can give such a bloom.As the sweet by the powers in the garden of flowers.Ever gave their own bowers such a darling perfume.And this liquid so rare if you willingly share.To be taking your hair when it's frizzled and dead.Oh the sod has the merit to yield the true spirit.So strong it will shake all the hairs from your head.Then stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature.For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys.Oh since its perfection, no doctor's direction.Can cleanse the complexion like poteen me boys.While a child in me cradle, me nurse with her ladle.Was filling my mouth with a notion of pap.When a drop from her bottle fell into my throttle.I stumbled and capered clean out of her lap.On the floor I lay crawlin' and screaming and bawling.'Til me mother and father were called to the fore.All sobbing and sighing they feared I was dying.But soon found I only was crying for more..So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature.For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys.Oh lord how they'd chuckle if babes in their truckle.They only could suckle on poteen me boys.Through my youthful aggression, through times of depression.My childhood's impression still clung to my mind.And at school or at college the basis of knowledge.I never could gulp 'til with whiskey combined.And as older I'm growing times ever bestowin'.On Erin's potation, a flavor so fine.And how ere they may lecture on jove and his nectar.Itself is the only true liquid divine.So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature.For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys.Oh lord, 'tis the right thing for courting and fighting.There's nowt so exciting as poteen me boys..Come guess me this riddle, what beats pipes and fiddle.What's hotter than mustard and milder than cream.What best wets your whistle, what's clearer than crystal.What's sweeter than honey and stronger than steam.What'll make the lame walk, what will make the dumb talk,.The elixir of life and philospher's stone.And what helped Mr. Brunnell to build the Thames Tunnel.Wasn't it poteen from ould Inisowen.So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature.For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys.Oh lord, it's no wonder, if lightning and thunder.Weren't made from the plunder of poteen me boys..You maidens pathetic, with lovers athletic.For liquid cosmetic, you can't beat the drop.With a glow to your cheek, it will make your heart leap.It'll quiet a stallion or cure an old cob.At the mouth you would drool, be reduced to a fool.You'd kick up your heels and you'd peel to the buff.Then 'tis he'd be pathetic while you'd be athletic.If only you'd take a few drops of the stuff.So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature.For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys.For there's nothing like whiskey to make maidens frisky.It soon separates all the men from the boys."
"At market day in Huntley toon.An' it was there, I did agree.Wi' Bogieside, the farmer.A twelve month for to fee.Tae drive his twa best horses.That's a task that I could do.Tae drive his twa best horses.In the harrow and the ploo.Now Bogie had a dochter.Her name was Isabelle.She was the lily o' the valley.An' the primrose o' the dell.An' when she went out walkin'.She chose me for her guide.Doon by the burn at Cairnie.Tae watch the fishes glide.And when three months was scarcely o'er.The lassie lost her bloom.An' the red fell frae her bonnie cheeks.An' her eyes began to swoon.Noo, the neist nine months were past and gone.She brought tae me a son.And I was quickly sent for tae.See what could be done.I said that I would marry her.But oh, that widna dae.For, ""You're nae match for Bonnie Belle.An' she's nae match for thee"".He sent me packin' doon the road.Wi' nae penny o' my fee.Sae a' ye lads o' Huntley toon.A lang fareweel tae ye.But noo she's marrit tae a tinker lad.Wha bides in Huntley toon.He mends pots and pans and paraffin lamps.Aan' scours the country roon.Maybe she's gotten a better match.Auld Bogie canna tell.But it was me wha's ta'en the maidenheid.O' Bogie's bonnie Belle"

Black bay whered you go.I have lost any light from your boats.And it only makes me feel more alone.Grey fog dont you tire.Of the dark isolation of night.I know that the pressure gives you life.I know that the truth comes with the quiet.But Im just so afraid of mine.So I blame the ones that I love.When I am no one to act as a judge.I know the bottles not best.But Im just so starved for some kind of rest.From these lungs.And my tied tongue.What makes a man cave.To the simple escape from his days.Is it only a triumph over fear.Of what happens when waking disapears.Or do we secretly love these tears
No answers.No absolutes.All theories.With no kind of proof.Clinging on to what we were told.In our youth.I know what they believe I just dont.Know why now.With all that weve learned.Still no answers.With no stone unturned.I know Im never gonna be right.And so I.Im filling my belly tonight
I read the advice in your letter.To see myself without a filter.So tonight I have locked all my doors.And Im down on all fours.Wild again.The dawnlight is slowly approaching.Eyes open to slow down the spinning.I bet youd be proud of me now.Lost in my own house.I cant find a way out.I used to believe.That shame only came on display.To the others.But I was wrong.Im here by myself and the feeling is strong.Im learning to split into portions.The pain that comes sharp with the morning.I take some with coffee and then.I bring some back to bed.And wait for a dream
You shouldnt trust me.I cant decide.Whether my instincts.Care what is right.If good is inherent.Its hard to find.Beneath the conceit.In our design.They say were the only.Capable of charity.But I would be lying.To make a claim.Of any decisions.That arent in vain.When even my giving.Could be explained.By the willful feelings.That overtake me
"In the dark of night.When the last drop of blind youth.Has left you.You will wake to find.That you have been lied to.You're nothing more.Than cells, same as the ones that surround you.And the will to make.And build what there isn't.Before you.Now will break.This paper and concrete.Are nothing new.Just earth moved and glued, stuck to you.I warned you.There's no use.Trying to win"
"Shivering.I am looking in at.People that I call my friends.Just a sillhouette.With a cigarette.And no idea who I am.There were songs in these eyes.But now theyre gone.If only I had held the light in.Flashing teeth.They are smiling.So happy to burn through their time.And I dont know when.But I lost the will to savor mine.Now theyre all.Stumbling to some other house.Though Ive tried I cant find any interest now.It takes.The guilt of just a small mistake.To puncture the joy.So its poisoned by doubt.I just wanted to face the expanse.But those dead ends have come to haunt me.I had tried to understand.How I should operate this body.And I was sure, but I was wrong.If only I had held the light in.The darkness would be gone"
"A knock on my door.Woke me this morning.Made by the hand.Of a well-dressed woman.Whod set aside.Part of her morning.To ask me if I know why Im alive.She walked by a man.Who scours the alley.Each day for cans.To trade for money.To buy a chance.To play the lottery.And when he doesnt win, he starts the cycle again.Made to scavenge.Like an animal.So I cannot help.But watch him searchin.For lucky breaks.Just like a vulture.And wonder if.His sense of purpose is any less than what Im gettin here.Bettered by wealth.and education.But just as unsettled.and impatient.I am too easily sustained.I cant sleep.If I am made to obey.Then why this brain.This plague of intellect that infects.Any peaceful state.Cause I cant say.If anything.Is meaningful.Or some impulse to trick me into.Another day.Of this grey"
Feed me make yourself proud.Fill my mouth up until I drown.You pull me onto dry land.And choke me out with the same two hands.We die and never come back.And each of us has to learn from scratch.So Im left to follow my gut.But who in the fuck can I trust when my own blood.Lies to me.Leads my mouth to drink.And then punishes me in the morning.I have no.Kind of hold.To pull myself from cold grief.That fills my heart with warning.So I fight but I cant stop the bite of these teeth.Dont you flatter yourself.We give or we take but were only selfish.Just blinking counting our days.Watching the shadows upon this cave
"We were sitting at a table at a little caf.Cleaning our plates like some kind of a race.We finished our meal without making a sound.I glanced at him, he flagged the waitress down.She brought us our check and said will that be all.He said, yeah thanks, and sent her off with a nod.I'm sure she was thinking, I don't know about those guys.But when she counted her tip, she had to smile.What I got from him is my stubborn side.and the tapping my fingers on the wheel when I drive.And the gift of keeping strangers an arms length away.Not knowing what I'm thinking behind my poker face.When I'm stuck in a crowd at a party somewhere.With people that I'm supposed to know.I don't do small talk, but I'll shake your hand.You'll wonder about me, and I'll consider us friends.What I got from him is my quiet side.And annoying everybody with how slow I can drive.And the habit of never calling anybody by name.So they're never quite sure if I know who they are.As they try to read my poker face.If you see us out at some little caf,.cleaning our plates like some kind of a race.And you can't figure out if we're happy or mad.That's the way that we like it, me and my dad.I tend to be a little bit cheap,.but I tip pretty well and I'm easy to please.And I like keeping strangers an arms length away.And I like keeping secrets behind my poker face"
"Tonight in Carolina, the bleachers are empty and quiet.Not a ball's been hit my way all night.I hit a grounder up the middle, but the shortstop made the play.I'll never make it to the big leagues this way.But the smell of fresh cut grass and peanut shells fill the southern sky.And we'll be heading back to Birmingham tonight.CHORUS;.These towns roll by like tumbleweeds.Through the windows of these late-night trains.To those of us down here, it's still a game.I may never be a hero, and you'll never know my name.But if I broke the record, I would do it clean.Last week out in Greenville, about an hour before the game.A boy was watching warm-ups, with a big smile on his face.He put down his popcorn, held out a ball and pen.He looked a little awestruck, as I signed it for him.I didn't ask for money, I just smiled and shook his hand.You should've seen the spring in his step, as he ran to show his dad.`.REPEAT CHORUS.America's favorite pastime, it's simple and it's pure.We all still watch the big leagues, but now we're not so sure.But if you can catch a game in Birmingham, on a perfect summer day.I'll run out every grounder, that's how I learned to play.It's not glamorous in double A, it's not for everyone.But baseball's what I do, who I am and what I love"
"The pocket is torn from the years it's spent catching.The car keys and the spare change.You can tell it's been worn from the tears in the stitching.This old sweatshirt's seen better days.In March '96 I was traveling through this town.And wanted a cheap souvenir.I would never have guessed from the name on the chest.That one day I'd end up living here.12.99, bought me the chance to stay warm for the night.Now in my mind, it takes straight back to that place and that time.It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99.I can still picture the red in her face.Just as clear as this stain on the sleeve.She was convinced that she'd ruined our first date.When she spilled her coffee on me.But the heat was no match for the look that she had.As the air outside kept getting colder.We drove to the beach, and she shivered beside me.And I draped it over her shoulders.12.99, bought her the chance to stay warm for the night.Now in my mind, it takes me straight back to that place and that time.It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99.It's just 13 bucks, at the courthouse downtown.For the papers to make her my bride.I dig through the pocket, and come up one coin short.The judge says that he'll let it slide.It's amazing the things you can buy.12.99, bought me the chance to look back on my life.One day in my mind, I will remember this place and this time.It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99"

"Farewell my sweet.Well the time that was coming.The road has begun to move beneath my feet.Good things come to an end.Well I hope through the pain.The heartache and strain we can still remain friends.Something about a southern girl.Make me feel right.In a Mississippi morning.She's an angel in flight.In a blink of an eye.She'll be out of your sight.Something about a southern girl.You're a soft melody.Well I swear that I heard.From a lost mockingbird stuck up in a tree.We got a lot going on.Even though I'm not here.Please don't shed any tears for me day when I'm gone.Something about a southern girl.Make me feel right.In a Mississippi morning.She's an angel in flight.In a blink of an eye.She'll be out of your sight.Something about a southern girl.I never meant to leave you lonely.It was only in your mind.Girl, I never meant to leave you lonely.It was only a matter of time.Something about a southern girl.Make me feel right.In a Mississippi morning.She's an angel in flight.In a blink of an eye.She'll be out of your sight.Something about a southern.Something about a southern girl"
"And if you wanna leave me.Baby, go ahead.I know you don't believe me.Oh, when I finally said that.I'm not myself.When I'm with you.It takes and breaks.My heart in two.I'm half a mile from Jersey.The headlights on the shore.You know how much it hurts me.I never been this deep before.And I'm not myself.When I'm with you.It takes and breaks.My heart in two.And oh, does anybody have a clue.How hard I worked at loving you?.And I'm not myself.When I'm with you.It takes and breaks.My heart in two"
"The phone rings.And I don't care who it is that is calling.You moved our things from ours to his.While outside the snow is falling.The wedding band that meant so much.Signified our blessed vow.Like coffee spills and unpaid bills and all my pills.It's in a dusty dresser drawer now.I watched these trees from green to brown.Suddenly this small town has gotten smaller.The arctic breeze it sings to me, and says now look.Any fool can go out and walk on water.I shoulda known that time alone.Would only serve to break you down.Don't know why I sit and stare at that damn thing sitting there.In a dusty dresser drawer now.Snow has turned to water.To please the trees.And cheer up that late bloomer.While I'm sipping on a beer counting down another year.Couldn't come a second sooner.I wonder how easily that ring it slid off of your finger.Did you stop for a moment.Let the memory of us linger.Or was it just an afterthought.Like casting water from a bow.I'm past the point of crying.For a love that lies there dying.In a dusty dresser drawer now.It's such a goddamn shame.Right next to your picture frame.In a dusty dresser drawer now.If anybody asks me what I think, that love is for now, I'll tell them.Look in a dusty dresser drawer now"
I never meant to be a burden.Oh I just worry more than I'd like to.I never meant to be a burden.Please forgive me if I've weighed on you.For so long I have lived amongst the shadows.Waiting for the sun to break on through.Oh it's time I cast my oars and head out on these shores.And find some place where I can start anew.I never meant to be a burden.Oh I just worry more than I'd like to.I never meant to be a burden.Please forgive me if I've weighed on you.Oh forgive if I've weighed upon your back.It's so heavy already without me.Going ahead into this abyss and find my own way out of this.So you can walk ahead more easily.I never meant to be a burden.But you're the light that is guiding me through.I never meant to be a burden.Please forgive me if I've weighed on you.Please forgive me if I've weighed on you.Please forgive me if I've weighed on you.Burden - Amos Lee
"Verse 1:.Well the morning came like a freight train, bearing down on me from a.Thousand miles a way..Well it came and gone and kept rolling on, laying up all night with tear.Stained sheet as my veil..Chorus:.I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to see you again, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to feel your breath.As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept.And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want the keys to our door, I donÃ¢ÂÂt live there anymore.And IÃ¢ÂÂll do my best just to forget the dreams weÃ¢ÂÂve dreamt.Verse 2:.Well the morning came with the pouring rain, and I felt just as empty as a.Pail..With the evidence and your crime confessed, it donÃ¢ÂÂt seem right that itÃ¢ÂÂs.Me that spent nights in jail..Chorus:.I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to see you again, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to feel your breath.As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept.And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want the keys to our door, cause I donÃ¢ÂÂt live there anymore.And IÃ¢ÂÂll do my best just to forget the dreams IÃ¢ÂÂve dreamt.Bridge:.If you feel a chill in the air, itÃ¢ÂÂs my spirit hanging somewhere.And if you ever get scared, look on the bright side.YouÃ¢ÂÂve got a new life.Verse 3:.Now the evening's come, and IÃ¢ÂÂm all alone.And I canÃ¢ÂÂt tell if silence is my foe or my friend.Well IÃ¢ÂÂm holding on, but I ainÃ¢ÂÂt too strong.IÃ¢ÂÂve gotta get some rest before that train come back around the bend.Chorus:.I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to see you again, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to feel your breath.As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept.And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want the keys to our door, I donÃ¢ÂÂt live there anymore.And IÃ¢ÂÂll do my best just to forget the dreams weÃ¢ÂÂve dreamtÃ¢ÂÂ¦.dreams weÃ¢ÂÂve.Dreamt"

"Well I walked over the bridge.Into the city where I live.And I saw my old landlord.Well we both said, ""Hello"".There was no where else to go.'Cause his rent I couldnt afford.Well relationships change.Though I think its kind of strange.How money makes a man grow.Ah, some people they claim.If you get enough fame.You live over the rainbow, over the rainbow.But the people on the street.Out on buses or on feet.We all got the same blood flow.Oh in society every dollar got a deed.We all need a place that we can go.And feel over the rainbow.Sometimes we forget what we got.Who we are or who we are not.I think we got a chance to make it right.Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight.Im in love with a girl whos in love with the world.Though I cant help but follow.Though I know someday she is bound to go away.And stay over the rainbow.Got to learn how to let her go over the rainbow.But sometimes we forget who we got.Who they are or who they are not.There is so much more in love than black and white.Keep it loose child, you gotta keep tight.Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight.Keep it tight, yeah"

"I aint no wide eyed rebel.Oh, but I aint no preachers son.And now I see the trouble.And all the loving that I have done.And the world aint no harder.Than its ever been.Looking for love.In the lies of a lonely friend.And so much superstition.And so much worry in my heart.I need a new religion.Its time to make a brand new start.And the world aint no easier.Than its ever been.Looking for love.In the lies of lonely friend.Remember when we were in California.We were so much happier then.Now were back in New York City.Looking for love in the lies of a lonely friend.And now the clocks are running.And no one knows where time goes.You know the moon is stunning.Its only shadows that she shows.And the world aint no harder.Than its ever been.Looking for love.In the lies of lonely friend.I aint no wide eyed rebel.Oh, but I aint no preachers son"
"I am at ease in the arms of a woman.Although now, most of my days I spend alone.Thousand miles, place I was born.When she wakes me, she takes me back home.Now, most days, I spend like a child.Who's afraid of ghosts in my mind.I know there ain't nothin' out there.I'm still afraid to turn on the lights.I am at ease in the arms of a woman.Although now, most of my days I spend alone.A thousand miles, place I was born.When she wakes me, she takes me back home.A thousand miles, place I was born.When she wakes me, she takes me back home.I am at ease in the arms of a woman.Although now, most of my days I spend alone.A thousand miles, place I was born.When she wakes me, she takes me.Ya, when she wakes me, she takes me.Ya, when she wakes me, she takes me back home.When she wakes me, she takes me back home"
"I've been waiting a long time.I was just hoping I might find.Ah, the right kind of lover for me.Well you know I've been lonesome.God knows we all been lonesome.Some people think being lonesome really means being free.But, I would give it all up for you.Yes I would give it all up for you.Yes I would give it up.Settle down.Stop looking around.I finally found something true.We live in a world full of confusion.A culture based in illusion.Ah, some people think it's amusing.But its really just fantasy.I would give it up for you.Yes I would give t all up for you.Yes I would give it up.Settle down.Stop looking around.I finally found.Ah, yeah.I would give it all.I would give it all up for you now baby.I would give it all.I would give it all.It would give it all up for you now baby"
"Did you believe them.When they told you they discovered you.And that everything is free.As long as you do what they tell you to.You think it's true.But nothing could be further from the truth, my love.Did you even listen when they told you to change your name.Now nobody wants honesty when looking at a perfect frame.Play the game.But nothing could be further from the truth, my love.And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world.Play it girl.Play it girl.Play it girl.Does it make you feel good.When they tell you what you want to hear.And after they suck all your soul.Well, that's when they'll disappear.Disappear, disappear for ever.Like a prince in your little fairy tale.And you will find it when they put your soul on sale.But nothing could be further from the truth, my love.And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world"
