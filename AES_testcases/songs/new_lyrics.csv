"2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake.""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?.I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season"".Yeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes.Like they have any right at all to criticize.Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason.And 'cause you can't jump the track,.We're like cars on a cable.And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table.No one can find the rewind button, girl.So cradle your head in your hands.And breathe, just breathe.Oh breathe, just breathe.In May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss.""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist.""Ain't been sober, since maybe October of last year"".Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while.But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles.Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it.'Cause you can't jump the track.We're like cars on a cable.And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table.No one can find the rewind button, boys.So cradle your head in your hands.And breathe, just breathe.Oh breathe, just breathe.There's a light at each end of this tunnel.You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out.And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again.If you only try turning around.2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song.If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer.Inside of me threatening the life it belongs to.And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd.'Cause these words are my diary, screaming out loud.And I know that you'll use them however you want to.But you can't jump the track.We're like cars on a cable.And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table.No one can find the rewind button now.Sing it if you understand.And breathe, just breathe.Oh breathe, just breathe.Oh breathe, just breathe.Oh breathe, just breathe"
"Sometimes I think of what I could have been, and then I kick myself, knowing.that I've ended up just like him..And there's other times it doesn't seem so bad, we always used to say, ""With.him dead they'll be no one in our way."".Remember the time he caught us in your room?.Your hands were down my underwear, and you're tig ol' bitties glistening in the.air..With a zip of my pants, headed for the door, and with a swing of his fist you.will lay down on the floor and....Chorus.Involuntary Self Defence-call it what you will..How can we go on? Where do we go from here?.Involuntary Self Defence-call it what you will..How can we go on? Where do we go from here?.Waitin' on the way home, the kid just liked to jump..I turned up the Judist priest, so I could get my gangsta groove on..And the baseball bat, called to me like a drug..What do you know, what do you know?.I'm gunna kill you mothers f*ckin' with a Louieville slugger..Chorus.Guitar Solo.Chorus"
"Turning over again, here for another day,.Still the thoughts of a dream, fragments you cant escape,.i wont let you down, wont let you down.i wont let you down.victoria.lets take it from the start.back to the beginning.victoria.i cant breathe when were apart.without you theres, nothing without you.standing out in the rain, watching the traffic slow.as the light begins to fade your warmed by the city glow.i wont let you down, wont let you down.i wont let you down,.victoria.lets take it from the start, back to the beginning.victoria.cant breathe when were apart, without you theres, nothing without you.theres nothing.theres nothing.nothing.Turning over again, healed for another day.victoria.lets take it from the start.back to the beginning.victorious.cant breathe when were apart.without you theres nothing, without you."
Oh pitiful.Feel so sorry for me.Pitiful.It's pitiful.Feel so sorry for me.Though you dont' love me you see.You still won't set me free.Oh set me free.I wonder why I wondered why you do me like you do.I wonder why you do me like you do.When you know that I love you baby.And you know I wouldn't do it to you.No no.It looks like it makes you happy.Just to see me cry.Please have mercy on this.Vacant heart of mine.You're trying to see how mean you can be.I would do my dog better that the way you do me.Pitiful.Feel so sorry for myself.Pitiful.Feel so sorry for myself.When you know that you dont' want me baby.But you aint' gonna let me have nobody else now are ya
"I can feel it now.I can feel my heart again.I thought I lost myself.I can feel it caving in.You can keep your venom saints.Just give me back my girl.When the city's dark.With her melancholy chords.I can feel her hollow skin.It's thin as billboards.You can win the poison race.Just give me back my girl.You can have la.Just give me back my girl.I feel it creeping in.Breaking my heart again.I don't know who I've been.Feels like I'm losing it all.You can have Los Angeles.Just give me back my girl.Feel like I'll never be good enough.Feel like I'll never be cool enough sometimes.Oh, I remember that was never the point!.And I don't ever want to lose you, love.I just want to know what shattered on the inside, yeah.Feels like I'm losing her.Like we'll never be what we were.Ever since the bubble burst.Feels like we're in reverse, oh!.You can have Los Angeles.Just give me back my girl.You can keep your angels.Just give me back my girl.You shine brighter than the city, love.You shine brighter than the city, love.You shine brighter than the city, love.You shine brighter than the city, love.You shine brighter than the city, love.You're shining brighter than the city, love.You shine brighter than the city, love.You shine brighter than the city, love.It feels like I'm losing you.Like I've been torn in two.After all that we've been through.Is there nothing that I could do, oh?.You can have Los Angeles.Just give me back my girl.You can keep your angels.Just give me back my girl.You can have Los Angeles.Just give me back my girl.You can have the basin.Just give me back my girl"
"The rise and fall of one life in a passing phrase. They've tried to sum it up but they've always failed. Never look down on experience you've gained. Torn photographs, still the picture remains, because I think and so therefore I am. Start to rebuild, write my own master plan. When we just don't know who'll save the day, waiting for someone to take us away. And those shades that once seemed oh so clear, three words dropped like stone settled dust re-appears. So lets take the plunge, we'll start today. Everyone seems to step out of the way..Everyone seems to step back from my life, first sign of strife. Clawed to shade just cause to save, they'll decline, Firing Line..The world you see is the world I want, and all the mistakes are the frames we'll cut. New energy was taken up, the fingers were pointed, it just fell off. Stole it then pointed it North, the only way we're going is up. Stole it then pointed North for what?.Started out great then her eyes fell to shade got to buy some more time then the light hid it's rays."
"The place where you abandoned me.Take me from yourself.Take yourself from the world.You seemed to be aging by the minute.You are getting older.and past your peak.You traced my very path.but you never had a clue.what my loneliness meant.We have more than enough of everything.I never had a chance.to interpret myself.Oh, If the present looks like the past.what will the future look like ?.what will the future look like ?.I can't remember the meaning of life.The place where you abandoned me.Take me from yourself.Take yourself from the world.You seemed to be aging by the minute.You are getting older.and past your peak"
"Ella nunca hablaba de amor, nadie saba si se enamor,.Si haba alguien en su corazn, porque lo ocult..Todos queran saber, lo que escondan sus ojos de ayer,.Esa mirada triste de llorar, nia enamorada?.Que clase de amor era, que oculta con gran pena,.Hasta que una noche, lo confes:.Me enamor, de alguien que no est aqu..Me enamor, y no lo puedo fingir..Y las lgrimas que dejo, en silencio,.Son de quererle y no tenerle, porque no puedo..Nunca podr olvidar, cuando sus ojos miraban al mar,.Viendo la Luna su cara brillar, y la consolaba..Que clase de amor era, que oculta con gran pena,.Hasta que una noche, lo confes:.Me enamor, y yo le quiero a morir..Me enamor, y s que no es para m..Y las lgrimas que dejo, en silencio,.Son de quererle y no tenerle, porque no puedo..Me enamor, de alguien que no est aqu..Me enamor, y no lo puedo fingir..Y las lgrimas que dejo, en silencio,.Son de quererle y no tenerle, porque no puedo."
"When clouds veil sun.And disaster comes.Oh, my soul.Oh, my soul.When waters rise.And hope takes flight.Oh, my soul.Oh, my soul.Oh, my soul.Ever faithful.Ever true.You I know.You never let go.You never let go.You never let go.You never let go.When clouds brought rain.And disaster came.Oh, my soul.Oh, my soul.When waters rose.And hope had flown.Oh, my soul.Oh, my soul.Oh, my soul.Oh, my soul.Overflows.Oh, what love, oh, what love.Oh, my soul.Fills hope.Perfect love that never lets go"
"Like a wheeling machine.Industry grinds.I've been walking between.Companys lines.But I say to myself.One day real soon.That I wont have to chew.Company's food.Company rules my day.Like a dog on a lead.told when to fetch.I've been chasing my tail.From one day to the next.It's a canine disease.Suffering Fair.But I know that I'll find.Sun and Fresh air, all day.When I get up.Early in the morning.And I get home.Early in the Evening.So I get High.Only for the feeling.Save your reply.Like a dog on a lead.I'm told when to fetch.I've been chasing my tail.From one day to the next.It's a canine disease.Suffering Fair.But I know that I'll find.Sun and Fresh Air all day.When I get up.Early in the morning.And I get home.Early in the evening.So I get High.Only for the feeling.Save your reply.Save your reply and fly.It's a feeling I get.Walking down the street.I recognise the effect.In everyone I meet.It's a dog gone affair.Keep me on a chain.Every time I run free.I always feel restrained.It's a feeling I get.Walking down the street.I recognise the effect.In everyone I meet.It's a dog gone affair.Keep me on a chain.Every time I run free.I always feel restrained"
"Sometimes you may think I take you for granted.And granted, sometimes maybe I do.'Cause I've grown so used to you lying next to me.That I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me.[Chorus].No I wouldn't want to get up in the morning if you weren't there.To kiss me and start my day off right.And to be waiting when I get home with loving just for me.No I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me.It's love that makes the world go round.And my love for you just grows with leaps and bounds.'Cause you know just what to do when the world has turned all blue.And I wouldn't want to live if you didn't love me"

"There was a time when love took my breath away.I thought a lack of oxygen meant love was here to stay.Now those butterflies just make my tummy ache.And that flutter in my chest ain't nothing but heartache.That big pink bubble is full of hot air and trouble.And I don't need that kind of happy.The kind that takes you up and brings you down.And I don't need that kind of sunshine.The kind that always shows up with a cloud.I don't need love that leaves ya crying, like I did before.I'm so happy I don't need that kind of happy anymore.There was a time when love swept me off my feet.I never thought Id have to come to grips with gravity.Now falling in love is still the sweet crazy thing to do.But when I take that leap again I'll have a parachute.You cant call it falling when you're on your knees crawling.And I don't need that kind of happy.The kind that takes you up and brings you down.And I don't need that kind of sunshine.The kind that always shows up with a cloud.I don't need love that leaves ya crying, like I did before.I'm so happy I don't need that kind of happy anymore.Just when I thought love might be.Nothing more than a, a bright shinny light.Oh, baby, with every kiss you remind me.Whoooo, I don't need that kind of happy.The kind that takes you up and brings you down.Whoo, hoooo, I don't need that kind of sunshine.The kind that always, always shows up with a cloud.I don't need love that leaves ya crying, like I did before.I'm so happy I don't need that kind of happy.I'm so happy I don't need that kind of happy.I'm so happy I don't need that kind of happy anymore"

"Sometimes love is not enough.Sometimes time is all you need.Sometimes a little too much makes you.a little too sad.Brings you right to your knees.Sometimes its just a game.Sometimes it seems a dream.Sometimes its all the same its just the card you choose to play.Depending on the deal.This love is real, this love is rare.Thats how I feel you can say what you want.I dont even care.Love can be strange made of paper and steel.This love could change our lives Cause this love is real.Sometimes you get too close.In just a few short days.And its just the telephone that keeps.your tender heart afloat.When hes so far away.Sometimes you hold your tongue.To hide whats in your heart.Sometimes youve got to let him go the one you think you love the most.Though it tears you apart.This love is real, this love is rare.Thats how I feel you can talk behind my back I dont even care.Love can be strange frayed at the seams.But this love could change our lives Cause this love is real.Love can be strange like a difficult dream.But this love could change our lives Cause.this love is real.Sometimes love is not enough.Sometimes time is all you need"

"He wakes up in the morning.He pulls his shirt and boots on.He grabs his lunch pale and heads out to the light.And he goes, and he goes and he works all day.For his meager little paycheck.When Monday comes his money is already spent.And when he gets home his dinners cold.His wife is yapping at the kids.And he snaps and decides to runaway.He's Gonna Drop A Bomb On You.He's Gonna Drop A Bomb On You.He's Gonna Drop A Bomb On You.Drop A Bomb, Drop A Bomb.He hopes one day for a better life.As he scratches his lottery ticket.The jackpot never comes, He hangs his head.And he goes, and he goes and he works all day.For his meager little paycheck.When Monday comes its off to work again.He's Gonna Drop A Bomb On You.He's Gonna Drop A Bomb On You.He's Gonna Drop A Bomb On You.Drop A Bomb, Drop A Bomb"
"Numb body blank emotion.Senses dulled feelings frayed.Life chord severed torn betrayed.Now born avoid I've never known.Blank stiff stare.Focus on nothing.The blur between my severed mind.Can you feel my voids in yours.Can you feel my rage below.Deeper down Ipush the pain.Could not foresee the final blow.Tightening knot clenched innards.The numbness ebbs and fades.An anger burns.Ripped from within me bled dry.Drain exit complete.Escape the emptiness.Mindless motions of each day.Here in the after.Nothing feels the same.What was to burn.What flared then broke.Beneath the strain.And to the past Isteer my mind.And sink into my thoughts.For here Isee you clearest.As the present blurs.And slips from vision.But as each day fades to the next.Your place in my mind deepens.Iresist, tighten my loossened grip.And feel the void consume.Feel the cruel fade of time.Image sinking, open wound.Smothered flame once burned.To ash descend, lifeline to end.So cold"

"Music: Albert Maroto.Lyrics: Elisa C.Martin.If I had it in my power....If I could remain here....Every minute, every hour.To leave knowing that I will return again.To return dreaming that I'll never go away.I'm a lost and scared hunter.But I chose this tortuous way.'Cause it's me and it's my life.I don't want to make mistakes.Your voice reminds me now that I'm alive.When you call me and say to me that all is fine.But now I miss the silence of the night.And the calmness of the sun.Sometimes I feel so far away from home.So far away from my life.Never felt this way before.Everytime I feel so far away from your love.Small things that become details.Now you have to let me go.Every second's like an hour.Every hour's like a day.I'll feel for the last time desire.And I'll turn and run away.If you think that I am strong.You are wrong!.'Cause I need my simple life.A piece of this world..."

"At a certain point it happens.Life becomes to real.And nothing can hold back.What is about to be.I don't know how close we need to get.To blind out the surroundings and focus on the real.I know you're gone.But this reality is crashing down on me.Crashing down to defeat all purpose.I know you're gone.I'm just not ready I'm just not done.I am ever in resistant disbelief.When raw emotion gets in.The way of our throughts and words.We pass so far beyond our breaking point.I don't know how far we need to be.From all that we don't want to see.To regain perspective.I know you're gone.But this reality is crashing down on me.Crashing down to defeat all purpose.I know you're gone.I'm just not ready I'm just not done.I am ever in resistant disbelief.I know, yet I fail to find purpose and form.I know, but the truth just makes it harder.I know you're gone.But this reality is crashing down on me.Crashing down to defeat all purpose.I know you're gone.I'm just not ready I'm just not done.I am ever in resistant disbelief"
"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I.Always hear when you sigh.Never in my wordland.Could there be ways to reveal.In a phrase how I feel.Have you ever heard two turtle doves.Bill and coo when they love?.That's the kind of magic.Music we make with our lips when we kiss.And there's a weepy old willow.He really knows how to cry.That's how I'd cry in my pillow.If you should tell me farewell and goodbye.Lullaby of Birdland whisper low.Kiss me sweet and we'll go.Flyin' high in Birdland.High in the sky up above.All because we're in love"

Well how can you have the unmitigated gall.To come back now expecting me to fall.Right down on my knees and kiss your feet yeah feet.Feet that one day went a walking out on me with a fast talking.Slob you hardly knew his name your mind is de-arranged.And where did you get the backbone and grit to come back now expecting me to fit.Right back into plans that we once made.Plans that now are gone forever to return never ever.I don't want you anymore so get away from my door.And let me live live live and let me live live live don't come messin' up my life again.How can you have the courage and the nerve to come back now expecting me to love You after the way that you've done me.Guess you think that I'm a fool but you're the one that's blew their cool.I don't need you anymore so get away from my door.And let me live live live...

Since I have known you there's a shadow hanging over you.Keeping you from scene that you might need me.It's too bad that you're not glad for I could take you to the place where love is.Someone you loved another time is standing in the way of mine.Wishes that I have to try and mend to pieces.But I know that it's too late I'll never take you to the place where love is.Where love is you will never know you are the kind to love one time and not let go.You don't know how much I wish that you would give just one kiss.And open up your heart to me so I could enter.But if I could only get you there you might find you'd like to share where love is
