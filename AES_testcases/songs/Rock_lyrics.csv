"A lot of cats are hatin', slandering makin' bad statements.Mad cause they sit on their ass just stagnating.Always vacillatin', now classmates I graduated with.Are wonderin' how the stupidest kid up in the class made it.Sick landscapin' and jammin' down in my mans basement.Getting restraints and complaints from mad neighbors.Now prejudice bigots say I sound just like them damn #%#.Them pair of lenses ain't repairin' their impaired vision.I'm on a mission escaping my own prison.Inflicting more pain then you're givin' see I'm my own victim.I can't believe I let you take up my time.Take up space in mind, give it here, I'm takin' what's mine.(Chrous).The only ounce of power that I have.Is what I do with now.And how I let the hours pass.I dont' know how long I'm gonna last.So I can't let ya snatch the powder out my hourglass.Everyday that I'm awake I face the angel of death.He may be taken my breath, so they can lay me to rest.And by now my inner state's the only place that I rep.The way that I dress is just another way to express.We know that some day everybody we see will be dead and rotten.Long forgotten, we oughta keep this for a normal topic.Because we all get caught up in all the drama.But what's the gossip gonna mean, when me and you are goners.See I never did audition for a part in this play.I know that some day I'll accidentally fall in my grave.So I can really give a shit about what all of ya say.According to me is how I'm spending all of my days.(Chorus).The world will keep turnin', the inferno will keep burnin'.But it's affirmative my life on Earth is impermanent.And since I'm visiting and my minutes here are limited.I ain't havin' or doin' shit if I ain't feelin' it.I'll lend a hand to a hurt pedestrian and I will help a friend.In any way that I can, but I can't let man get up in the way of my plans.Make me stray from my path, I can't be takin' that chance.(Chorus)"
"Somebody tell me why we landed here on the planet left stranded.We suffer in this land then we leave it empty-handed.Experienced a fraction of eternity then vanish.I never took advantage, I just took it all for granted.In my youth man, I used to smoke a quarter a night.Was bored of my life, ignoring all the glorious sights.I was lost getting caught up in all the hype.It took me ten years to get my priorities right.I'm up close and personal with my daily abuse.But all you fairies say spare me cause you're scared of the truth.Chorus.Why oh why must everyone be in disguise.You get nothing out of living lies.Why? Cause everybody needs to hide.Why oh why must everyone be in disguise.You get nothing out of living lies.Why? Cause everybody needs to hide.You know I really think it's funny.When you're flaunting all your automobiles.Cause I know that money's something that you oughta conceal.The more you reveal the more we know it all isn't real.I bet you frauds keep talkin' till your coffin is sealed.But it's ok, you behave in anyway that you want.Cause I can look you in the face and know you're fakin' the funk.So take a second and brace yourself for taken this punch.You may leave a little shaken when I break through your front.Chorus.I was just another white kid who suffered an identity crisis.I ain't the only one I know that many are like this.So I did it how I did it never cared if they liked it.Kids got so excited they were ready to bite shit.Me getting on the mic is just like getting a license.To be hittin' all you critics that are stereotypin'.My only problem is I got plenty of vices.But I'll Keep on writin' till I'm ready and ripe.Chorus"
"I'm spittin' with the venom.To your soul through flesh and denim.I kill every opponent with the message that I send 'em.And I leave 'em, with no heart-beatin', the lungs breathin'.Their last thought was questioning the demon they believe in.Forcing me to start kickin' mental martial arts.Piercing they hearts, with all these metaphorical darts.Make use of this verbal abuse and call a truce.'Cause the verse hurts worse, and works quick as a noose.Stop frontin', you wantin' my mouth to stop running.Some sought assault, but the thoughts kept comin'.The last man who tried, well, he died in his sleep.I can't believe what I was saying put him 6 feet deep.Diagnosed with an overload flow to his brain.I guess the truth that I told him, must have drove him insane.Any rough @.$@., can pull the trigger, but I'm bigger.The poisoned lyrics make you sick quicker than liquor.So go blast your gun, I'm gonna be the one who'll be yellin' victory.When all is said and done son.Now I'm battling my wars.With chords and metaphors.Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword.Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force.For sure the pen's mightier than the sword.Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure.Of course the pen's mightier than the sword.So blow me up with a bomb, I'll move on and go beyond.Like the wayward son, and carry on.I'm forever green, I'm what you never seen before.What you thought was raw was far from hardcore.I'm alive on a compact disc, I never miss, I always hit.Assuring I'll forever exist.Three times as arrogant as Cannibis is.Now they teaching classes, calling it The Borial-Analysis.I grip the mic as if I'm never gonna pass it.When I spit the ancient and eternal to the masses.Enthusiastic, opposite of plastic.Just recorded this shit, and it's already classic.Man on a mission, holding my position.With no war paints, just poetic ammunition.Now I'm battling my wars.With chords and metaphors.Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword.Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force.For sure the pen's mightier than the sword.Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure.Of course the pen's mightier than the sword.Combat, without physical contact, you're under attack.Gettin' bashed, smashed, slashed, and gashed.With the sharp tongue, piercin' your ear drum.It's fearsome, slinging your gun son, I ain't even got one.I'm doing what I say, and saying what I mean.With words that cut clean from a poet supreme.I flip tha Tai-Chi Chuan, droppin' terrorist bombs.With blood from Lebanon like Kahlil Gibran.I reside in the hills outside the city walls.Behind closed doors with the infinite source.While you're dwellin' in your hood, inhaling the smog.I'll be in the woods, puffin' logs talkin' to God.Uninvolved with ya'll, I'm watchin' all far from afar.Loungin' on a mountain top, countin' the stars.Now I'm battling my wars.With chords and metaphors.Lord knows the pen's mightier than the sword.Armed with my thoughts and the almighty force.For sure the pen's mightier than the sword.Destroy the flesh, but the core will endure.Of course the pen's mightier than the sword.Mightier than the sword (3X)"
"Where should I begin cripplin' all you villains in.Never injuring the civilians that are innocent.So sick of listening to a bunch of synonyms.Same band every man but aint no need to mention them.You actors had me crackin' up with laughter.Now you gonna have to hear another cracker rapper.Still hearing all of these people callin' me a wannabe.But I'm gonna keep it going 'cuz you heard them all from me.Chorus.You can cover your ears, but the noise won't stop,.Your still gonna hear the white trash hip-rock..You can cover your ears, but the noise won't stop,.You know your still gonna hear the white trash hip-rock,.You can cover your ears, but the noise won't stop!.See everything's a challenge when you're chemically imbalanced.So I thought a single soul would never see my talent.Y'all figured by now that I would throw the towel in.Tellin' me repeatedly the genre's overcrowded.But some of these cats are done with the past.And I wonder if they ever had a love for the craft.No you'll never see my turntablist in the back, pretending to scratch.Cuz anyone who did it is wack..Chorus.To all the Blinks, Eddie Vedders and the Kurt Cobains.It's a shame you impersonators sound the same.You can't resurrect a legend and emulate the veteran.Man I would love to level the devil who let them in.Instead of breaking out a switchblade and carving it in.I'll address the enemy and stab his heart with a pen.You can't wait for this hip rock style to end.I'm sorry my friend, this shit has just started again!.Chorus 2x"
"Enough of all that, let's switch up the format,.And talk some more trash, I'm getting bored fast.Ain't gonna talk gats, just hand-to-hand combat,.Man-to-man, full contact, on the floor mat,.Your weak blows are deflectable,.I'll go toe-to-toe with you, at your own dojo,.Want none of you bozos at my show,.where some silly hoe's shakin' her ass up in my video.I didn't kick flows in the cold until my lips froze,.So folk can always tell me how my shit goes.I grab a pencil like it's a pistol.But this way it isn't problem if it hits you.You won't see what you want from me,.So don't come to me well ""what's it all mean?"" cause'.It don't mean a thing.Your lies is all I despise,.Been fightin' guys like you all my life and.They don't mean a thing..My best shit ain't even on my set list,.Cus half the listeners won't even get this,.So what! you sold records, you ain't respected,.You went too far and tried too hard to be accepted,.This can never be a thing of jealousy,.Just don't be tellin' me to check the melody,.I got the better beats, got the better rhymes,.I made sure I bettered mine ahead of time.So what's up kid? Your big head's been busted,.Don't get disgusted, I'm just servin' justice..You won't see what you want from me,.So don't come to me well ""what's it all mean?"" cause'.It don't mean a thing.Your lies is all I despise,.Been fightin' guys like you all my life and.They don't mean a thing..So don't attempt, to beg for my pardon,.Cause' I'll keep talkin' til' my arteries harden,.I've takin' losses, told off some bosses,.Sick of all them jobs that all make me nauseous,.It ain't worth it, workin' for no purpose,.For cash I'm hurtin', future's uncertain,.So I keep searching, livin' and learnin',.Earnest to earn everything I'm deservin'.If I can't be on the stage with my band jammin',.I'll be standin' on the street corner panhandlin'!.You won't see what you want from me,.So don't come to me well ""what's it all mean?"" cause'.It don't mean a thing.Your lies is all I despise,.Been fightin' guys like you all my life and.They don't mean a thing..You won't see what you want from me,.So don't come to me well ""what's it all mean?"" cause'.It don't mean a thing.Your lies is all I despise,.Been fightin' guys like you all my life and.They don't mean a thing."
"They say the end's near.But I'll approach it with no fear.When the smoke clears I'll find my spirit is still here.May take years to find it the prophets are real.Too much damage to inhabit the planet, that's severe.I talk shit you heartless paupers can't feel.With concepts the smartest robber can't steal.Your fears will cause all ya'll to pour tears.Cause the bomb that I'm droppin' is landing, so stand clear.Are there any queers here in the theater tonight?.We'll get 'em up against the wall and stick 'em with dynamite.Cause there's something going on in my head that ain't right.But I'm getting ready to take flight, so hang tight.It don't matter if you're standing tall.If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall.Don't gonna try to abide by the law.No one alive is surviving the holocaust.It don't matter if you're standing tall.If your thinking small, we all rise and fall.Don't gonna try to abide by the law.No one alive is surviving the holocaust.Fuck partying like it's 1999.Ain't watching the ball fall, ain't calculating time.Watching polar caps melt, and the coastline rise.See the ocean divide, and nine planets align.Sun shining too bright, igniting the Alpines.With petrified eyes were watching at ringside.Can't run, you can't hide, panicking worldwide.When straight out the sky, falls great balls of fire.I'll sneak on the spot where the shuttle is launched.Strap me and a broad onto a rocket and blast off.We'll be following the way of the Force like Star Wars.And I'll start a new fam' when I land on Mars.It don't matter if you're standing tall.If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall.Don't gonna try to abide by the law.No one alive is surviving the holocaust.It don't matter if you're standing tall.If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall.Don't gonna try to abide by the law.No one alive is surviving the holocaust.Now when the end comes, and your time here is done.Will you look back and say, overall, it was all fun?.Well life's been good to me so far like Joe Walsh.But it won't break my heart if it all falls apart.It don't matter if you're standing tall.If you're thinking small, we all rise and fall.Don't gonna try to abide by the law.No one alive is surviving the holocaust"
"You can't sit still..I watched your movement from the corner catch my eye..Imagining you here right by my side..The fire in your eyes is blazing, and it burns right through me..Little girl your so amazing..Don't you know you drive me crazy, and I'd love to get to know you. Here I am so won't you take me and blow me away..You seem so close..If I could know your thoughts, if I could read your mind..Some things are never meant to be defined..It's now or never..Here I am..There you are..Wish upon a falling star"
"Looking back, no turning back..Wouldn't take it back for a second..So unsure yet unashamed love..You turn my world upside down..Open up your heart and let me in..Open up your eyes. Don't you see?.When I'm with you I loose control..When I'm with you I am irrational..And when you're near I fall in love..Gripping fears unknown..It's getting harder to breath..The little things that guarantee..And this slow surefire dance..I need you to know that I want you this way..I'll take everything you are..I'll take the fall for you..Show you I will...give everything I am"
"I am taken.I am not my own.I am floating.Teach me how to fly.I am Solomon.Waiting to sing his song.I am for you, I am for you.And I am older.But I feel so new.I am unfaithful.I am true.You know I'm so in love with you.I am all these things.But I'm nothing without you"
"Come alone and make no.Attempt to save yourself from what you know.Had to happen.Come alone.Come alone.I wish I would have listened when I figured out.You knew me from the inside.Your eyes on mine, on mine, and I'm.I'm afraid and alone with your eternal love in my hands.And this bread, your body.I know, I know, I know, you know.Come alone.From the garden to the hill.Come my love.I have fallen.I have betrayed.So irresolute in my mind.I can't stop pacing, anticipating.Could this be my fate in the end?.Cause I'm afraid in the light of the look in your eyes when they're locked on mine.I turn away, cause I know you see right through me.Come alone.From the garden to the hill.Come my love.I have fallen.I have betrayed you.Here I lie.My guilt is my sentence.You have been my life.I will end it with a kiss.Come alone, my love.My love, my love.(I have fallen).(I have betrayed)"
"You say your hurting is over..It feels like you're back from the dead..But still I can't believe it's over,.And I can't get your sight, your scent from my head..It seems like these moments are lasting forever,.The times when we felt alive..You carried my heart in the midst of this battle.In your hands..This time I won't try to reach you..You're already too far gone..Slipped past and I didn't notice,.Did we ever sing the same song?.Two lives, two books of illusion,.A chapter in the essence of time..The story we wrote in one season,.Came to an end in one night..Remember the times when we started believing,.That everything would be alright?.You carried my heart in the midst of this battle....In your hands..And I'll wait for you. I'll become something new..And I'll sing for you until this dream comes true"

Woke up this morning and I was in hell.Across from me sat the devil.He said sit down son and give up hope.You're another statistic in the world of dope.I was there on a junkie dare.It was a rollicking affair.Mom and Dad were called n.I had O.D. and there I was.Talking to the lord of sin and lust.Memory comes back i'm in a room.Placed our bets and filled up the spoon.Heavy scene I hit the floor.Love and honor were no more.Rig falls out I'm failing fast.Heartbeat stops while the winner laughs.Now they're stuck with lifeless lesh.Need a three piece suit and a new casket.They close my eyes those fucking pricks.While I live out eternity in the flaming styx
In the corner I see you there.Wired to an electric chair.I run over and jump in your lap.They throw the switch and everything turns black.I invite you to my suicide.I want you to be my bride.There you are in the alleyway.I caught you lookin my way.I started thinking and I started dreaming.My dick got hard and I started craming

I remember holdin' on to you.All them long and lonely nights I put you through.Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry.But I can't remember if we said goodbye.But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico.One place I may never go in my life again.Was I just off somewhere just too high.But I can't remember if we said goodbye.I only miss you here every now and then.Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean.Most Novembers I break down and cry.But I can't remember if we said goodbye
"You don't hug and kiss me anymore.I want you in stitches on the floor.Woo me once twice and don't do it again.Expert advice says it's all in the men.Won't you love me again.Anxious, uptight, low track, one self mind.Take this, take that, take it all of the time.Woo me once twice and don't do it again.Don't you know me, hey, I'm your best friend.Won't you love me again.When you say that you love me again.You won't mean it like you did back then.When you say that you love me again.Catwalk, sweet talk, love me, you love me not.Ass-kiss, nose wipe baby stoned on pot.Use me once twice and don't do it again.This time's the last time.'Cause baby I'm your perfect ten.When you say that you love me again.You won't mean it like you did back then.When you say that you love me again.You won't mean it like you did back then.When you say that you love me again.When you say that you love me again.When you say that you love me again, see'mon"

"Going by the riot.Call the rest a stone.Leading to the isle.I don't wanna go.Nothing really matters.Even life or death.Meeting with the man.To feel the dragons breath.Where is the future?.There is no past.Only the present.And will it last?.Greed is the product.Of the fruitful days.Brother have no worries.Captain Adler's case.Lucifer beside me.We are holding hands.I don't need to travel.[Unverified] across the land.Oh Lucifer, please take my hand.Oh Lucifer gonna take my hand.(Yup)"
"New day when beauty's all gone..And blues follows a lifeless prowl.My traveled mind spins way too far.My whining head is impossible to hold.My eyes are dead the dub ice cold.The spies are all gone.Suddenly the sky is clear but so hard to feel.Quiet hatred blows my mind as everything around me all breaks down.As they watch by the fires a reality you a.Change is all I want but I can't do it all.When the crystal world can the darkness call?.No I'm no good you're no god.When you do tear down my fences to fall.New day now they're breaking my wall.I'm building an army for my mental wall.Just give me your mind your head and your soul.Give me your sun and show me your moon.One step closer they will sigh.Your future with the past.Heads may go so we can choose before they take you out.In shallow truth and hate your days go by.Experiments in lies.We're all in line to step aside till you stick to their plan.They say you're insane so don't say a word.If it has a name, it has no trace.The dust makes things red.The life that you lived will never come back.And there's nothing easy so hit with the rain.They say you're insane so don't say a word.If it has a name, it has no trace.The traveled mind is all about freedom.The dust that you breathe makes everything red.Life that your lived will never come back.And there's nothing easy.So hit with the rain.Change is but I can do it all.When the crystal world can the darkness call.No I'm no good you're no god.When you do tear down my fences to fall.No I'm no good you're no god.When you do tear down my fences to fall"
"I wasn't there when you needed me.You never let me in your life.I didn't say what bothered me.You sure said more than that.The silence that followed didn't do us any good.And it seems like you settled for me.Cause I was the best that you could get.But there wasn't enough.I know what you want and you're not the one for me.I've been leaving you since the day we met.And it feels like you have too.I remember when I met you.The day I saw your smile.And now it's time to let go, oh, it's time to feel alive.The problems I had with you.Are the ones you had with me.Even though we were holding love.We both know we drifted apart.I guess this is it ? why bother when there's nothing left.When neither you nor me are here.Growing bitter and uncomfortably numb.Losing what we had.At least we tried but it wasn't meant to be.I've been leaving you since the day we met.And it feels like you have too.The reasons that I loved you.Are the ones that made me go.The reasons that I loved you.Oh, I've got to let you low, know ?.I should have seen it coming, should have known what to expect.I should have seen the signs, should have known that it was wrong.I've been leaving you since the day that we met.And it feels like you have too.The reasons that I loved you.Oh, are the ones that made me go.The reasons that I loved you.Oh, I got to let you low, know ?.I am sorry that we got here.But I'm glad, glad that we are done.I don't wanna go back there.Cause the love I felt is gone.Cause the love I felt is gone"

"Tucked in the woods.Near North Chicago.Early November.Commences our saga.Two loved in silence.For fear of corruption.Then fate chimed in.With an evil grin and a mighty interruption.She awoke in a panic.The TV in static.She heard a voice.In the attic.Crouched behind her door.With a Swiss Army knife.She cried in silence.Fearing for her life.Protecting herself.She stabbed the intruder.The lights turned on.Her knife impaled her suitor.She'd committed a murder.While he laid there bleeding.She stared, clearly scared.Checked her boyfriend's heart for beating.It's not right.The lights get dim.And all she thinks of is him.She cried through the morning.As she read the paper.Her father told police.The boy broke in to rape her.She ran to the bathroom.Enraged and pissed.Grabbed a razor.And tic-tac-toed her wrist.She'd committed a murder.And while she laid there bleeding.She stared, clearly scared.Checked her final pulse for beating.It's not right.The lights get dim.And all she thinks of is him"
"Here's my song about gun control.As my politics begin to roll.Things are getting out of control.It's time to stop, drop and rock 'n' roll.We built and sold them the guns.Made in America.Glued to the tube TV before Dallas 1963.It was assumed baby boomers.Bloomed doomed to ruin the country.But who knew the children of Normandy.Soon would resume war with Vietnamese.Overseas, we sent 18 year-olds to bleed.Face it, like Oswald woke the nation.Osama woke my generation.Now the kids of Nintendo.If drafted will attend the.Bush administration family agenda.Of bending back hands and sending children.Attacking Iraqi lands and buildings.So Cheney can rebuild for 200 billion.They'll disarm the regime but not the children.We built and sold them the guns.Made in America.Sacrificing our kids lives for global crisis.While fools of the NRA.Watch kids shoot kids in high schools.With tools they say kill deer.Not fill pools of blood.And guts, and tears, and the love and trust.We lent to the government.That's here to protect not just guns but us.Don't place blame on video games.Marilyn Manson or NWA.How can we blame them for the situation?.When an Alzheimer's patient.Leads the Nation Rifle Association.We built and sold them the guns.Made in America.I'm a Reagan Baby.My formative years are the 1980s.Russian production and reduction.Of weapons of mass destruction.Happened already.Even the Cuban missile crisis.Had pictures of bombs throughout the island.To sway bias.And now we hide behind bombs.Dropped on innocent moms.Ignoring gun control and dropping stocks.Senate majority leaders opposing '57 Little Rock.While we annihilate North Korea, Iran and Iraq.If the government shoots first.To stimulate commerce.Things are only going to get worse.If the government shoots first.We built and sold them the guns.Made in America.We sold them the same guns.That are now facing back towards us.And what do we do?.We go over there.But until we view here and there as the same place.We will always be fighting another religion, another race.There are peaceful solutions.There are peaceful resolutions.Peace"
Our Christmas bonus.Was spared with patience.While men who owned us.Took paid vacations.They tried to clone us.To fight deflation.They should have blown us.What?.For reparations.Instead we eavesdropped.Found secret files.Of bad accounting.In shredded piles.As pressure mounted.So did denials.Evidence will drag those criminals.To face the man in trial.Good-bye Martha my dear!.Go Away.Taking down upper management. What?.Taking down upper management. What?.Taking down upper management. What?.Taking down upper management. What?.For all those who work honestly.Building up our economy.Some bosses take the liberty.To take our money happily.Though what's up falls eventually.They tore down our economy.Lock them up in a penitentiary.Hide the key for half a century.Good-bye Martha my dear!.Go Away.Taking down upper management. What?.Taking down upper management. What?.Taking down upper management. What?.Taking down upper management.Captains go down with their ships.Not jump ship as they go down.All these pricks stood back.And watched their companies drown.They paid us with junk bonds.Sold stocks before the sale.But they failed!

Reagan Presidential Library.Live from the West Side Los Angeles.Yelling to the Lower East Side tenements.Who am I to criticize politics and yet glorify drugs and sex?.Well I'm the next evolution of the revolution.Fighting those over thirty and the institution.This musician's contribution is.A rendezvous for the new revolutionist.This new revolution is.Whatever it is"
"Dear Slim,.My favorite icon put the bong and the knife down.I'm sick of the songs about strapping your mom and your ex-wife down.To a nuclear bomb and dropping them on Saddam.Killing all the muses you use in almost all of your songs.Except those songs about Slim the Hip-Hoppian God.They make it seem you don't respect rappers like Biggie and Pac.Who if it weren't for them you be out of a job.Or flipping burgers with Ronald McDonald and not leading your mob.But the Blob's offensive, run and jumping the fences.And burying politicians in pop culture trenches.Dude, have some humility, oops responsibility, oops accountability, oops I said humility.Your face has covered worse magazines.than the artists and politicians you've mocked on every CD release.Ooh, how cool; you've proved you lack tact in your songs.In fact, you've grown up to act just like your mom.If y'all represent the truth and America's youth.Act like a leader we could actually use.You're a celebrity now, oh no, look what you did.You're America's role model but deny that you're it.Come on, come on, let's stand together as one.I ain't yelling about selling my soul, going to hell and back for platinum.Or gold to show the world is a gullible globe.Although, I can't respect the coalition of politicians signing petitions.Fearing Eminem's mission to bitch.When it's his right to taunt if he wants to fight.Even if you're frightened of what he might want to write.You're sworn to defend men, who offend men.Just because you believe in the first amendment.Even if it's illogical angst and vengeance.So defend your senses, but cleanse your dirty lenses.The law's written to both conservatives and leftists.It says Vanilla Ice Preservatives can be sexist.If y'all represent the truth and America's youth.Act like the leaders we could actually use.You're politicians now, oh no, look what you did.You're America's role models but deny art from our kids.Come on, come on, let's stand together as one.Censoring, the denial of actual words or factual things declared obscene.But molesting archdiocese, disease,.dead people in the streets from shooting sprees, epidemics.Paramedics clearing debris here and overseas aren't banned from TV.But yell shit, goddamn, or fuck hear three individual bleeps.A word's a word, let it be heard and learned.It's not the individual words but the order that hurts.Come on, come on, let's stand together as one.Come on, come on, stop threatening to censor our thoughts.And you'll get the response you want from now on.Come on, come on"
"Strolling down the strip, we were straight strip tripping.Tipping all the dealers we were straight gin sipping.Go gamble, fuck hos, everybody knows everybody smokes dope.You can smell on our clothes.A little bit of indo a little bit of girls.Because we were kind of curious what was under their skirts.Oh, we're just fucking around.They don't know we're just fucking around.Split it, hit it, win it, stick around for a minute.Throw another bill in it; though, you'll be broke without credit.You will be glad that you did, 'cause you'll be fucked up and faded.With a gold digger who's pretty and thinks that you're rich and witty.Oh, we're just fucking around.They don't know we're just fucking around.I'd been stinking from drinking.My boys are AWOL I'm thinking.I needed a room for the weekend.On to the hotel with the beacon.I gave a tip to this chick it was a chip worth a grip but that was it.A wink and a key and I went to my room.Oh, not two, there were three different whores all for me.What a time what a place they won't remember my face.No one knows, oh, we're just fucking around.They don't know we're just fucking around.Soon afternoon came and I'd been up for two days.I had played the same game with money and hos you know how it goes.Our weekend had ended with all the hos we befriended.But our egos had landed since we went home empty handed.Come on and let's go, let's go hit the road for four hours home.We'll go and get stoned and no one will know"
"I read the pages about me.In her autobiography.They were brief and to the point.A flash, while you are getting dressed.A memory that needs to be repressed.I'll just wait until it's over.Since you've gone away.I never know just what to say.Since you've gone away.I never know just what to say.Cause I like cars more than telephones.Your voice in my ear makes me feel so alone.Tonight I'm gonna drive.The silver moon is shining bright.Over the interstate.God saying hurry don't be late.Soon the sun will rise.That's when the romance dies.And I'm just tired of running around.I walked.To get the mail today.I guess.Your letter never came.I'll just.Check again tomorrow.A flash while you are getting dressed.A Memory that needs to be repressed.I'll just wait without saying a word.Since you've gone away.I never know just what to say.Since you've gone away.I never know just what to say.Cause I like cars more than telephones.Your voice in my head makes me feel so alone.Tonight I'm gonna drive.The silver moon is shining bright.Over the interstate.God saying hurry don't be late.Soon the sun will rise.That's when the romance dies.And I'm just tired of running around.But fuck it I love you even if.I'm gonna feel like shit.By the time I get to you.Now the sky is turning blue.The stars they disappear.One by one as the daylights nears.And yes you're in my head.But that doesn't make you here.And I've lost all my friends.But you're the one I miss the most.And now I'm almost there.Yeah I'm almost to the coast.And if I had any notion.Of how I'm gonna drive my car across.the Atlantic Ocean,.I'd be fucking set."
I'm jailed within.The cell I'm in.And once again.You're on my mind.Trapped inside.The days go by.I wonder why.You're on my mind.I count the days.And dream of ways.To see your face.You're on my mind.SOS.I'm in duress.Nevertheless.You're on my mind.Take me out.Dig me out of this hole.Tortured and beat.I'm nearing defeat.I'm incomplete.You're on my mind.I scream and shout.I can't get out.Without a doubt.You're on my mind.He hid the key.Away from me.Break me free.You're on my mind.There's no excuse.For endless abuse.'Cause this is the truth.You're on my mind.Take me out.Dig me out of this hole.Pictures of you.A fading clue.The love I knew.You're on my mind.It's you I need.Not food or drink.I'm on the brink.You're on my mind.He hid the key.Away from me.Break me free.You're on my mind.SOS.I'm in duress.Nevertheless.You're on my mind.Take me out.Dig me out of this hole.Break me out of prison.Before my parole.Scared for my health.With no where to hide.I'd rather be dead and.Start over with a fresh life.Take me out.Dig me out of this hole
"Burning bridges, breaking hearts.Everything you taught us to do.We're burning bridges, and breaking hearts.No home to come home to.We're burning bridges, and breaking hearts.I won't look you in the eye.And burning bridges, breaking hearts.Caught you in a friendship lie.Took a visit, to your old house.The windows were all boarded up.Try to hold these, memories.The ocean in a paper cup.There's no future in this town.They barricade the buildings there.To the lion, you've been cast.Only bones are gonna last.There's a city, underground.There's a city made of glass.There's a city, (there's a city) underground.Hurry cause it's breaking fast.And burning bridges, and breaking hearts.Everything you taught us to do.We're burning bridges and breaking hearts.No home to come home to.We're burning bridges.(and breaking hearts).We're burning bridges.(and breaking hearts).Burning bridges, breaking hearts.(breaking hearts).Burning bridges, breaking hearts.Everything you taught us to do.We're burning bridges and breaking hearts.No home to come home to.We're burning bridges and breaking hearts.Everything you taught us to do.We're burning bridges and breaking hearts.No home to come home to.We're burning bridges and breaking hearts.Everything you taught us to do.We're burning bridges and breaking hearts"
"I lay on my back in the lake at night in the summer time trying to remember.Every last second, every last breath that I spent with you.The yellow dotted line, reflected in your eyes.You scream as the crickets fly in the open window.Please don't cry love.Come on babe, we both know that I'll stay.The Virgin Mary lives beside the highway.Let's go and see her today.We've both felt love before even if we deny it.That familiar feeling of believing that we'll die without it.Be we never do, well not completely.Come on babe, we both know that I'll stay.The Virgin Mary lives beside the highway.Let's go and see her lets ask her blessing today.Bless us.Bless us"
"You could be President if your daddy was first.If your brother the governor had the power to coerce.It's absurd but he could change laws so certain votes were heard.For what it's worth, that ""democratic"" election could be yours.Blinded by the Right.It's the beginning of the end.Now Big Brother is your friend.The Patriot Act enacted allows the government in.To see how you spend, read what you read, jail you indefinitely.And defend they don't intend to end your personal privacy.Blinded by the Right.It's fucked up being seduced by the coalition of Christ.Ignore the Saudis though they backed the 9/11 attacks.Why fight economic allies who share a border with Iraq.Deceive and say Saddam hides weapons that might blow up the US.Let's take him out instead, yeah, and make the Iranians next.We'll feel good about ourselves though Bin Laden is on the run.While Saddam Hussein appears as public enemy number one.Conveniently forgetting it's the Saudis we should fight against.Neglect the UN.Ship kids and bring them back in a body bag.Is it a quagmire yet?.I'll bet this ain't as bad as it gets.Just ask your local hero the homeless Vietnam Vet.What was it like losing your friends fighting a cause that wasn't just?.Well, son, it just was what it was, justice I never saw.Blinded by the Right.It's fucked up being seduced by the coalition of Christ.I wish my vote counted.I wish my vote was counted.I was Blinded, Blinded.I wish my vote was counted.Blinded, Blinded.I was"
