"Hello, greetings and welcome. Welcome to a new beginning, for this tape will serve you as a new beginning. That's right, a new beginning, as we're about ready to begin. On this recording, music specifically created for its pleasurable effects upon your mind, body and emotions is mixed with a warm orange colored liquid. Your body is now a glass container. You can smell the orange colored liquid, for the deeper you go, the deeper you go. And if there's extra saliva there, swallow it and take yourself down deeper and deeper. Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper..Choose..I will be your guide in this journey, and I hope to be of help without intruding any more than is absolutely necessary. You may just possibly detect from my voice that I am Irish, and now I leap forward in time. The answer is blowing in the....I am calm and calm. I am relaxed and relaxed. I am the loop that goes 'round and 'round in your head, flowing warmth. Whoever you think you presently are, thank you. Hmmm... it's far out. It's far out. All that you read, all that you see, all that you hear. Filling up your head... orange colored liquid. It is nice to relax, isn't it. Put the key in the lock, unlock the door, and a fountain of ears is available. If possible, in our modern world, listen for your eyes in your ears. We will continue this pattern until we have reached the Infinite Everything. Now put on some undergarments and go deeper, and deeper, and deeper..."
"At this extraordinary time in history where consciousness is exploding and developing.take the room that you need to rotate.and love.To be in this world.To be a fleshy temple.Allow the deep energy to flow through.From below.Realize that your eyes are made up of atoms that are microscopic.And are mostly space.They're in fact filled with the substance of your life.You're very essence fills these space.And even if through accident or through surgery.Those powerful structures have been removed.Out of your body.Relax.Let go.Expand.There's more space there.Than there is matter.More space.To relax.You do so much work.There's so much going on.You're old.And used up at the atomic level.Give yourself a rest.Allow yourself to release.Through the nose.Through the mouth.And into the spaces located just about.An inch or an inch and a half below your metaphorical heart.And about two inches behind who you were meant to be.Allow greater clarity and finer atunement.The ability to hear essence speak.To allow your brain to expand.This muscle that pumps.The magic of your hands.Your deep, brilliant golden teeth.Beaming through the transverse column.You too were carved.Giving yourself the Buddha belly(?).With love.And with the passage of food over many years.Realize for a moment that the average human being only uses about 5 percent of they're brain.the other 95 percent is available for.food"
"Alright now, shhhh, I have the nicest surprise for you,.but you first must wash your face and get ready....(splashing) hmmm, hmmm, hmmm....Listen carefully... shhh. I want to tell you a story about Hip Hop..Hello little Hip Hop..The flowers liked Hip Hop, and Hip Hop liked the flowers. (Yes.).He lived with his sister, Skip Hop (La la la...).and his brother, Slide Hop. (Hey.).He never rests. He beats and whirrs and whirrs so fast that you can't.tell what he looks like. (Thump thump, prrrrrr, click click, quack.).Little Hip Hop started to hop, Skip Hop didn't know when they would.ever stop. Hip Hop for breakfast, lunch and dinner..Look at all the pretty flowers... (Acht, zeven, zes, grapefruit.).One day, Hip Hop took a deep breath, shut his eyes, and jumped....""ahhhhh!"".Poor Hip Hop, there was was, right in your house... ooooh..(""Be careful!"", ""Hello Canada!"", ""...like Buddhists"",.""That's all-natural."", ""Nein!"", ""Gezichts-massage."").""I closed my eyes and jumped until... Thump!.I didn't mean to hop into your home, really I didn't!"".One small tear came. ""Stop crying little Hip Hop,.I'm glad you came to see me. I get lonesome.with no one to make me laugh. Ho ho ho!"".And off they went with a hop and a hip,.a skip and a slide, all happy inside..Their heads bobbed up and down....How funny he looks, jumping up and down, whirling in the air....and the flowers love him. He's always around some flowers..Now you see the trouble little Hip Hop got into..It was all because he didn't look where he hopped....and even the flowers talk to each other, like people do,.but the sounds they make are different..Listen carefully, and try to understand what they say."
"A cold freezin night..Oh, Baby..Kill em'. I wish I was a boy..A cold freezin' night..Oh, Baby..Ah, Ow, Ah, Ow.C'mon, clap, clap, clap..Alright that's the attitude..Ow, Ow, Ow, Ow, Ah, Ow.And, i wish I was a boy..A cold freezin' night..Holy cow!.Why do you always get away with things? It's not fair, I tell ya. It's not fair.I wanna blow your brains out with...I am going to kill you..I neet to think of something, so you can stay alive as long as I want you to, because so I can kill you..You are such an idiot, idiot, idiot..I can kill you with a rifle...a shotgun, any way I want to. Probably by cutting your toes off and working my way up, towards your brain. A cold freezin' night. Oh, Baby. Oh, sing with me? Sing with me? Boys do tougher than girls, I know that..And, I wish I was a boy. And he is a a**hole. He is that a**hole. He's takin' a box off of his a**hole. I wish I was a boy..Kill'em. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna rip your hair off. Your gonna be bald, and everybody's gonna think....Ay! A cold freezin' night. Oh, Baby. Ah, Ow, Ah, Ow. Sing with me! Sing with me! I believe I can soar. Ayo. Uh!Ay. Shake your booty. You are such a NERD. A**hole. I wish I was a boy. Your gonna get busted. Kill'em! Dead. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna rip your hair off. Your gonna be bald, and everybody's gonna think ""Eh, look at Meredith, she's an idiot, hahaha!"""
"yeah... and if it's a wall, then you should cast a shadow..or maybe possibly, it's a thought you think is true,.when you appear to be: belief, belief..I never loved a wall so much..hey yeah....asleep in a chair,.where the two go click..Look at the floor, flat pattern order..oh, it's the great power one receives from a very modest source,.oh, and you don't feel a thing,.when you drink from the springs of living water."
"Putting your body on the line here, so tuning in now to the feet. You might try lifting them up towards the ears, and when you feel comfortable with it, allowing your eyes to close gently, in your mind's eye. Your being merges with the garbage, becomes one with it, so that all your energies in this moment are held in awareness by the smells, and remembering that there is no one right way to doing the dishes. And let go completely of the question of time. When this happens, as an experiment, see if you can float on a rubber raft into a big pot of boredom, letting it all cook in your mind's eye, where it cooks all by itself, stirring it, perhaps, every once and a while..Is that ok with you?.Stare at yourself in the mirror until you feel a burning sensation. Now remove your head completely, your head is floating in the air..With your left brain, close your eyes. Stick out your tongue to the universe, and imagine your own peculiar vibration. Deeper, deeper, deeper. Several thousand years of external happiness and exaltation of our psyche. Free we are from complexities..Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing, relaxing....As we go down the elevator, as you continue to listen to the sound of my voice... (number three) As you drink this water day after day after day (number two) Don't allow your eyes to move from this spot for a moment. That's it! (number one) Your eyes remove themselves from your body, for your own good. Your mind will become a sponge, you're a masterpiece, a work of art. You are becoming, beyond any shadow of a doubt... Blue Rose. Blue Rose!.Look out there though. Look:.First there is an L, and then there is an O, and then there is a V, and then there is an E. A box of LOVE in the meadow of your mind... Keep the lid on it!.And this becomes your reality. That's right. And at any time you feel yourself weaken in any way you think the word 'food'. This is your trigger word and the moment you think or say the word, from this very moment on, you will only eat. You gain enormously in weight, and all desire for self-esteem will disappear, and so it is, and so it is. And you now have an unseen assistance:.And it feels so good, so relaxed, and so at ease,.and you're becoming the world and everyone in it."
"And I see (5x).The hold-out boy and the weather girl,.know the wind moves in a patient way.Like a two-decade day.The man in the mouth of a drain.Laughing and chewing erasers.Like a black dog in the snow.Write in relief and sleep again.and you cant believe your eyes.and you can't find your pen.and the man in the hole.is your new friend's friend.Symmetrical foot in your mouth.and your high speed legs.Your knee-jerks a mark of distinction.It's an elevator put-on.Count your dollar, only one.and count it again.one one one.You can't count it when your dead, no.You keep a pure nose.Write in relief and sleep again.and you get in the hole,.with your new friend's friend.and he can't believe his eyes.and he can't find his pen.And the meteorological man.With a whirl-wind girl.And a mote in the sun.And a squid in a bag.And a raccoon hat.And a talking plant.And a careful goat.In a sewer system shaft"
