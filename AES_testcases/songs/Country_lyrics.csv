"Verse 1:.When the last, breath of life.Is gone from, my body.And my lips, are as cold as the sea.When my friends gather 'round.For my, farewell party.Want you, pretend you love me.Chorus:.There will be flowers from those.Who cry, when I'm gone.And leave you in this, world alone.I know you'll have fun.At my, farewell party.I know, you'll be glad, when I'm gone.Verse 2:.Don't be mad at me, for wanting to keep you.Till my life on this old world is through.You'll be free at the end of my farewell party.But I'll go away loving you.Repeat Chorus:.Oh, I know you'll be glad when I'm gone"
"I wonder if you've had the time it takes to think it over.And sort out all the feel-ings in your mind.Some-times I think you've found some-one to do your thinking for you.'Cause lately you've been show-in' all the signs.[Chorus].Should I come home or should I go cra-zy.I'm begging you please make up your mind.If you love me, then think it all o-ver.Make up your mind, or I'll lose mine.Last night when I came by I rang the bell and no one answered.But I heard voices whisper through the door.Now I'm not sure if any-one was home to do the talk-ing.'Cause lately I hear voices more and more.[Chorus]"
I still recall the morning that I met you.Standing out in front of Wilson's five and dime.Staring through the window at the jewelry.Hungry for the things you couldn't buy.Just like a fool I thought that I could please you.I saw you had an eye for things that shine.I paid seven saw mill dollars for a bracelet.Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind..[Chorus:].Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver.With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine.Everything except my soul has been surrendered.Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind..The cabin that I built in West Virginia.Was not enough to keep you satisfied.'Cause a man that's got a saw mill occupation.Can't afford to feed a rich girls' appetite.I wonder if you're still with Willie Jackson.Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive.Ol' Willie he gave up his wife and children.Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind..[Chorus:]
"Mornings closing in on me, how can I face another dawn?.My life lost all meaning, the minute she was gone.I begged and I pleaded, I done all a man can do.I've tried everything lord, now it's time I turned to you.I know you can move a mountain, take the stars out of the sky.You can send down a rainbow, you can even turn the tide.Once you even made a blind man see, changed the water into wine.I need a miracle, please Jesus, would you change her mind?.When she was here beside me, lord you know how good it was.Who have ever thought back then I could have lost her love?.Now I'm standing here a broken man, I can't make it by myself.I may not be worthy lord, but won't you get me through this hell.I need a miracle please Jesus would you change her mind?"
"The old man told his story.About the years gone by.How he played his horn down in New Orleans.In some old dingy dive.""I knew 'em all back then."" he said.As he reached out for his horn.He closed his eyes - and wet his lips.Then the blues were born..He played with so much feelin'.Tears came from his eyes.He stopped and reminisced a bit.And then he gave a sigh!.Said, ""You know, I almost made it.But that was before your time.Dixieland, Po' Folks Blues.ScatMan Jack and wine."".Slapped his knee and gave a grin.It sure was good back then.Reaching for his horn on the floor.Placed it in an old towsack.That hung across his back.He said ""Goodbye!"".And shuffled out the door..Enthused by what he told me.I never got his name.So, I called the waitress over.And started to explain.A tired old man - his tarnished horn.Mem'ries of years gone by.How he played his horn and reminisced.Smiled with tear-dimmed eyes..She said you are mistaken.There's been no one but you.But I know who you're talkin' 'bout.I used to know him, too.You'll find him down on Basin Street.In back of an old churchyard.A stone that reads, ""Rest in Peace.I tried but it sure was hard."".CHORUS.He said, ""Goodbye"" then shuffled out the door."
"The sun goes down in Calvin county.Neon lights from an old beer sign.Shown through the window out on the sidewalk.As I walked in to pass the time;.I looked around, sat down at a table.Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine.And through the door came a little old lady.She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime..Paper Rosie, Paper Rosie.She sold you Paper Roses, but they only cost a dime..Silver hair that's lost its' Gold.Trembling hand as she passed the rose.Red Crepe paper, made nature's bouquet.Help a little old lady buy a rose today;.I took the rose from her trembling hand.With eyes of age, she smiled and walked away.Like a breath of spring I could smell the rose.It came alive and I heard her say..Buy my Roses, pretty roses.They're only made of paper.But they only cost a dime..I went to look for her outside.A spray of roses lay by her side.The sky lit up and the choir sang.A thousand voices as the church bells rang..They sang Rosie (Rosie), paper Rosie (Rosie).She sold you Paper Roses.But they only cost a dime..Paper Rosie (Rosie), Paper Rosie (Rosie).She sold you paper roses.But they only cost a dim"
"Well' I got off work and headed for town to have a few.Determined I would drown the pain of losing you.But this couple on the dance floor were droppin' quarters in a slot.And this heartless thing kept spinnin' old forget-me-nots.The jukebox played along to my misery in song.Just as if it felt the pain that I was goin' through.Oh, it wailed out Crying Time and You Were Always On My Mind.I was singin' the blues and the jukebox played along.Well' the more I drank the more it became a mystery.How the men who wrote these songs wrote then just for me.They must have hid out in my closet or they had to read my mail.Lord, I must have heard at least ten dollars worth of Hell.Oh, the jukebox played along to my misery in song.Just as if it felt the pain that I was goin' through.It played I'm Born To Lose and I Can't Stop Loving You.I was singin' the blues and the jukebox played along"
"Fancy meeting you here.I guess I always knew there'd.Come a time we'd meet this way.It's good to see your face again.How long has it been.It seems like only yesterday..You know I still remember.Time we spent together.Little things we'd do and say.The night you said goodbye.Stays here on my mind.As if it were only yesterday..I feel the unrelenting march of time.And every day I fall another day behind.I want no other love, I wish on stars above.Not for tomorrow only yesterday..I feel the unrelenting march of time.And every day I fall another day behind..Our love builds on for me.It is my everything.But for you it's only yesterday.But for you it's only yesterday"
"I know there's nothing worse than a bad goodbye.And you think you'll feel better if you have a good cry.But save those tears for tomorrow when there's nothing better to do.It's a beautiful night, don't waste it on the blues.Time is all it takes for a broken heart to mend.And sooner or later you know you'll try to love again.So why not start tonight, you've only got the hurtin' to lose.There's a full moon out, don't waste it on the blues.Don't waste one more minute.Leavin' a bad break, to keep you home in the dark.There's nothin' like a walk in the moonlight.To let love run away with your heart.You could turn on your stereo and play your saddest songs.Sit by your window and stare out all night long.But if you look up you'll see the stars are just too bright to refuse.It's a beautiful night, don't waste it on the blues"
"Our bodies lay here side by side.But our thoughts have turned the other way.We make the conversation of two people.Who have nothing left to say.We're so accustomed to each other.We no longer care or bother.And there lies the danger.You know the size of clothes I wear.You know how I comb my hair.But you could know as much about a stranger.I can't remember the last time.That I really wanted you.And we both say nothings wrong.But it's here in everything we do.So we get up from our beds.Leaving many thing unsaid.And there lies the danger.Many of my words you don't hear.You seldom notice if I'm near.You could know as much about a stranger.What went wrong, I can't name it.Find the fault, I can't blame it.On any one thing.We're so used to things this way.Tomorrow's just like yesterday.And there lies the danger.You know the colour of my eyes.You know the things I despise.But you could know as much about a stranger.Yes, you could know as much about a stranger"
Take Me As I Am (Or Let Me Go).Written by Boudleaux Bryant.Gene Watson.Why do you always try to make me over.Take me as i am or let me go.White lilies never grow in fields of clover.Take me as i am or let me go..You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love.In the image of someone you used to know.I won't be a-standin' for an old love.So take me as i am or let me go..You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love.In the image of someone you used to know.I won't be a-standin' for an old love.Take me as i am or let me go..Ho Just take me as i am or let me go.
"From somewhere outside, I hear a.Street vendor cry ""filet gumbo"".From my window I see him, going.Down the street and he don't know.That we fell right to sleep.In the damp tangled sheets so soon.After love in the hot afternoon.Now the bourbon street lady,.Sleeps like a baby in the shadows.(in the shadows).She was new to me, full of mystery,.But now I know (but know I know).That she's just a girl,.And I'm just a guy, in a room.Full of love in the hot afternoon.We got high in the park,.This morning and we sat, without talkin'.Then she came back here,.In the heat of the day, tired of walkin'.Where under her breath,.She hummed to herself a tune.Of love in the hot afternoon"
"I was along neckin' with the boys at the local hot spot.In the midst of celebratin' this newfound freedom I've got.They ain't call them walking papers wasn't even right.So when she brought 'em here tonight.I was expecting to see that same dang doe tears bounce.But she's a looking like a new woman.My, would you look at that dress.Every eye is on her.She is a walking, talking, little miss confident.Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman.She's got my buddies in the palm of her hand.And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man.How did she go from stone cold to red hot, open tonight.All this honey she is pourin', she must have kept bottled all the time.'Cause heaven knows that I can't believe, that little devil's my used to be.This might be fair play, boys but she ain't playin' right.She's a looking like a new woman.She is in neon light.She's gone from every day square.To party hardy, wild thing, overnight.Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman.Sleek blond with a faking big ten.Sure hits a bad time for me to be her actual man.She's emptying every barstool, got the boys formed in a line.I think I'll slip on back 'cause I can't take the sight.But her a looking like a new woman.My, would you look at that dress.Every eye is on her.She is a walking, talking, little miss confident.Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman.She's got my buddies in the palm of her hands.And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man.She picked a hell of a time for me to be her actual man"
"When you finally tell me what I know is on your mind.Don't cry, don't let those teardrops start.Just tell me that you're leaving and you'll be gone for good.But speak softly, you're talking to my heart.True love is a treasure that few men ever find.I thought that I'd found it from the start.Now it's over, it's so over.Only a fool would stay to watch it fall apart.How I tried to change your mind.I sold my soul, lost my pride.What's that reflection in your eyes.Is it your plan to love another man?.How I tried to change your mind.I sold my soul, lost my pride.What's that reflection in your eyes.Is it your plan to love another man?"
"My mind knows full well I should leave here.But my heart, my foolish heart will not turn.She fills me with a crazy wild desire.And, lying helpless, I know just how I'll burn.Back in the fire where my heart must long to be.If it wasn't so, then why, oh, why does it keep draggin' me?.Back in the fire to the flames of ecstasy.I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me.At times I've gone as far as believing.This tortured soul of mine was finally free.Then those long, silent, leftover feelings.Say I'm a pretender, and I'll surrender willingly.Back in the fire where my heart must long to be.If it wasn't so, then why, oh, why does it keep draggin' me?.Back in the fire to the flames of ecstasy.I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me.I guess I'll always love the way she burns in me"
"I feel so sorry for my friends, now, that you'd left me.I just don't have the time to see them like I used to do.I know they worry but each night I hurry.To get home to my memories of you.I've got so many, I've not lost any.Like treasure packed away they get me through.To fit my sad time, I just go through my mind.And pick out the perfect memory of you.I don't feel lonely anymore that's what they don't see.There's so many happy thoughts of you that I can use.It's not real life but I know you're still mine.When I'm goin' through my memories of you.I've got so many, I've not lost any.Like treasure packed away they get me through.To fit my sad time, I just go through my mind.And pick out the perfect memory of you"
"Little by little, round by round.Weve been caught in the middle.Two hearts breakin down.Weve been fightin each other.With our backs to the wall.And little by little, were losin it all.We saw it comin, the end of the line.Weve been hurting each other, time after time.Over and over, we ignored what we saw.And little by little were losin it all.Your fault or my fault, nobody cares.It no longer matters, there's just nothing there.But a few tiny pieces waiting to fall.And little by little we're losin' it all.We saw it comin, the end of the line.Weve been hurting each other, time after time.Over and over, we ignored what we saw.And little by little were losin it all"
"I wish I could step out of my mind.Then I could be someone that's never known you.But I can't change the way I am much less the way you feel.Or you'd be loving me forever still.I can't stop the winter from turning into spring.Or summer giving way to autumn winds.But if I could take the world and make it face the other way.Then you'd love me forever again.If I had a way of changing time.I?d stay busy turning back the pages.If I could make a miracle, I'd make one just for you.And you'd be loving me forever too.I can't stop the winter from turning into spring.Or summer giving way to autumn winds.But if I could take the world and make it face the other way.Then you'd love me forever again, you'd love me forever again"
"I sobered up in Houston.In the bed of my pickup truck.My head was hangin' so heavy.I could hardly hold it up.I got to thinkin' 'bout.Sweet little woman I left all alone.And that's when I started rollin'.Drinkin' my way back home.Drinkin' my way back home.Listenin' to a honky tonk song.I hope the Devil in my soul don't steer me wrong.'Cause I'm drinkin' my way back home.I can feel that Texas sun.Down on this redneck of mine.Every time I pop top.I'm getting closer to the Arkansas line.I left a trail of Lone Star beers.From here to San Antone.So, baby, here I come, don't worry.Drinkin' my way back home.Drinkin' my way back home.Listenin' to a honky tonk song.I hope the Devil in my soul don't steer me wrong.'Cause I'm drinkin' my way back home.Drinkin' my way back home.Listenin' to a honky tonk song.I hope the Devil in my soul don't steer me wrong.'Cause I'm drinkin' my way back home.Here I come, baby"
"This morning I am leaving I've been up all night long.You're right, I'm tired of waiting for you to come home.I've begged and tried to change you but you've grown worse each day.If I'm a fool for leaving I'd be twice the fool to stay.I'd rather be called foolish and find somebody else.Then to be a fool forever and not forgive myself.I'm exactly what you've made me but I hope to change someday.If I'm a fool for leaving I'd be twice the fool to stay.I'd rather be called foolish and find somebody else.Then to be a fool forever and not forgive myself.I'm exactly what you've made me but I hope to change someday.If I'm a fool for leaving I'd be twice the fool to stay.If I'm a fool for leaving I'd be twice the fool to stay"
"At last, my love has come along.my lonely days are over, and life is like a song.At last,the skies above are blue.My heart was wrapped in clover.Every since the night I looked at you.And I found a dream that I could speak to.A dream to call my own.I found a thrill to press my cheek to.A thrill I'd never known.When you smiled, and then the spell was cast.And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last.I found a dream that I could speak to,.A dream to call my own.I found a thrill to press my cheek to.A thrill like I had never known.You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast.And here we are in Heaven.I found my love at last"
When we first started on our way through love.We thought we were two of a kind.We thought forever was just you and me.And always a matter of time.Time has a way of changin' it's mind.We're givin' on each others heart.Our love grew till it ran out of room.Now it looks like we're growing apart.We had a mountain of our very own.That turned out we just couldn't climb.We've just been waiting for something to give.And we've been standing in line.Time has a way of changin' it's mind.We're givin' on each others heart.Our love grew till it ran out of room.Now it looks like we're growing apart
"I stay out late most every night until closing time.Tryin' to find a way to drink your mem'ry off my mind.And even if it goes just right, I'd never make a bet.But sometimes I get lucky and forget.Sometimes I can close my eyes and you're not waiting there.Constantly reminding me how much you used to care.And losing you is one thing I guess I'll always regret.But sometimes I get lucky and forget.Sweet Rose and burgundy just lead to scotch and rye.At times it hurts me so much I just hang my head and cry.No, it ain't been easy for me, I'm not over you yet.But sometimes I get lucky and forget.Sometimes I can close my eyes and you're not waiting there.Constantly reminding me how much you used to care.And losing you is one thing I guess I'll always regret.But sometimes I get lucky and forget"
"I just called to thank you for turning me around.And showing me how love feels when it's right.You erased a memory my teardrops couldn't drown.When you put out an old flame last night.I never thought I'd find myself leaving her behind.But thanks to you, I finally see the light.'Cause I woke up this morning without her on my mind.You put out an old flame last night.It never even crossed my mind, finding someone else.'Cause I've been loving her 'most all my life.But you poured out more love to me than I have ever felt.When you put out an old flame last night.I never thought I'd find myself leaving her behind.But thanks to you, I finally see the light.'Cause I woke up this morning without her on my mind.You put out an old flame last night.Yes, you put out an old flame last night"
"She has the new dress I bought her.And a house for our love used to be.She has the kids after all that she did.But she has no memory of me.She still has my friends around her.And they are looking at her differently.She has a life of her own where I don't belong.But she has no memory of me.She has no memory of me.Forgetting comes easy it seems.After all that she's done she still haven't found.But she has no memory of me.She looks in the mirror in her room.There's a smile where the tears used to be.Her life hasn't changed, it's just rearranged.But she has no memory of me.She has no memory of me.Forgetting comes easy it seems.After all that she's done she's still haven't found.But she has no memory of me.After all she's done she's still haven't found.But she has no memory of me.(She has no memory of me)"
"My woman thinks I wouldn't cheat on her when we're apart.But there's a secret hidden in the shadows of my heart.The truth is catching up with me and it's hard to hide my shame.What she don't know won't hurt her but it's drivin' me insane.My mind can't take my body runnin' 'round anymore.That guilty feelin's waitin' for me right outside my door.So let's just call it off tonight and let my conscience be.What she don't know won't hurt her but it's destroyin' me.It bothers me every time I hear the doorbell ring.That someone might be droppin' by to tell her everything.I stay upset 'cause I don't know if anybody sees.What she don't know won't hurt her but it's destroyin' me.My mind can't take my body runnin' 'round anymore.That guilty feelin's waitin' for me right outside my door.So let's just call it off tonight and let my conscience be.What she don't know won't hurt her but it's destroyin' me.What she don't know won't hurt her but, Lord, it's killin' me"
"Here you are back on my mind where you stay quite a lot.Bringing back all the old memories I thought I'd forgot.I just keep finding you with me and I don't know why.Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye.I can't believe how you keep hanging on to my mind.Now I know leaving means one goes and one stays behind.I can't escape from you no matter how hard I try.Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye.Maybe, I should've been watching when you walked away.Maybe, you wouldn't keep turning up day after day.If I'd paid attention I'd know you didn't lie.Maybe, I should've been listening when you said, goodbye.Maybe, I should've been listening you said, goodbye"
"I'll be your companion.Stay right here by your side.And I will never let go.Until the day you die.Here 'til the end.The best love you'll find.If you'll just hold me.Some say I'm trouble.From the first touch of your hand.But I can bring you comfort.And I'll always understand.I'll quench your thirst.In the desert sand.If you'll just hold me.Oh, I am just a bottle.And I'm only made of glass.But I am full of courage.To help you forget the past.I'll be strong when you're weak.If you'll give me a try.Oh, with your help I can rule your life.If you'll just hold me.Temptation is my Kingdom.And I rule it day and night.Oh, I can take two wrongs you've done.And make them seem alright.I'll conceal the truth.'Til you believe a lie.If you'll just hold me.Oh, I am just a bottle.And I'm only made of glass.But I am full of courage.To help you forget the past.I'll be strong when you're weak.If you'll give me a try.Oh, with your help I can rule your life.If you'll just hold me.I'll be strong when you're weak.If you'll give me a try.Oh, I can be the last love of your life.If you'll just hold me.If you'll just hold me.Won't you hold me?.Oh, please hold me"
"You may wonder why I never do stay sober.I'll tell my story if somebody wants to hear.There is someone that I never got over.I still think about her often, but now not quiet so clear.'cause the whiskey numbs my mind and clouds my vision.So her memory doesn't hurt me all the time.And the longer I stay in this condition.With any luck at all I'll lose my mind.There's no way to completely drown memory.I oughta know 'cause I've tried too far so long.But no matter how I drink, she's always with me.And I know I won't forget her till my mind's completely gone.But the whiskey numbs my mind and clouds my vision.So her memory doesn't hurt me all the time.And the longer I stay in this condition.With any luck at all I'll lose my mind.With any luck at all I'll lose my mind"
"Oh dear, out here.Everybody stumbles on fear.Who cares if we're scared?.Everyone is on their own.It's only you that my heart desires.Only you alone can know my pain.All alone you were sitting there.Folding pages for your paper chain.Now you can cut me free.Forever say goodbye.Or we'll be holding hands and go on.Together you and I forever.Heartbreaks, mistakes.Catching up to me in all the ways.I've known of hard days.And my share of lonely nights.It's only you that my heart desires.Only you alone can break my fall.I pace the floor and I wish for more.While you were dreaming with your paper dolls.Now you can cut me free.To when it all unfolds.We'll be holding hands and go on.Together you and I forever"
"I left home a long long time ago.In a tin can for the road.With a suitcase and some songs.Chasing miles through the night time.Making tracks with no time for looking back.To the place where I belong.How these days grow long.But I'm on my way back home.It's been hard to be away.How I miss you and I just want to kiss you.And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day.How these days grow long.When you're sad, you know I wish I could be there.To make your sorrows disappear.And set your troubles free.It's not fair for me to be this far from you.But I promise to stay true.Wherever I might be.Time keeps burning, the whels keep on turning.Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my days.How I miss you and I just want to kiss you.And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day.How these days grow long.Time keeps burning on.How these days grow long.Now I'm lost in a sea of sunken dreams.While the sound of drunken screams echoes in the night.But I know all of this will come to pass.And I'll be with you at last forever by your side.How these days grow long.But I'm on my way back home.It's been hard to be away.How I miss you and I just want to kiss you.And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day.Time keeps burning, the wheels keep on turning.Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my days.How I miss you and I just want to kiss you.And I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day.How these days grow long.Time keeps burning on.How these days grow long"
"Dreams, I have dreams when I'm awake when I'm asleep.And you, you are in my Dreams.You're underneath my skin, how am I so weak.And now in my dreams,.I can feel the weight, I can just come clean.I keep it to myself, I know what it means.I can't have you, but I have dreams.How long, can you hold your breath?.Can you count to ten, can you let it pass?.Keep, can you keep it in?.Keep it behind lashes, can you make it last?.And now in my dreams, I can feel the weight.I can just come clean.I keep it to myself, I know what it means.I can't have you, but I have dreams.Oh, I have dreams, I have dreams.(And then an amazing guitar solo).Mind, can you read my mind?.Has it come undone, am I showin' signs?.And now, in my dreams.I can feel the weight, I can just come clean.I keep it to myself, I know what it means.I can't have you, but I have dreams.I have dreams, I have, I have, I have Dreams"
"Its not the end of the world its not even over.But it will be soon I never learned my lesson.I just changed my tune and no one seems to notice.But you will, you will.Its no big deal.But the last thing I think of when I close my eyes.And the first thing on my mind when I arise.It is a day and you're not really in my life.You can try and you wont find it where you're looking.You can hold it till its putty in your hands.And you cant break a heart that wasn't even yours to break.You can never be there for me in the end.And I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will.I will, I will, I will.You're not fooling me.I'm not the sort of girl that cant see reason.But its nothing that a little bit of time wont heal.I know it don't come easy but I love you, I do.Coming clean.Means never closing curtains I just changed my scene.Oh but you know what I mean and I will learn throughout my life.To never believe what will have been.I can try and I wont find it where I'm looking.I can hold it till its putty in my hands.You cant break a heart that wasn't even yours to break.You can never be there for me in the end.But I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will.I will, I will, I will.I don't think you ever learned a thing from me.But I'm sure that you want me to learn from you.And you've drawn heavy, handed lines around morality.About yourself and I don't share your point of view.Its about time to let you go and I thought its time to let you know.And it has to be the one that you'd regret.I have to say that I'm proud to know you.And ill never be the same because we met.You might not miss this I will, I will, I will.I will, I will, I will.I will, I will, I will.I will, I will, I will"
"I must have been sleeping, I must have been drinking,.I haven't been dreaming about you for years. there was a sharp.Turn and a sunburn I was too cool for high school that year..Must have have been new years. no one invited you,.Took things too far but I missed you and your antics..You were lonesome and blue-eyed and so special to us..You could have taken a long break.Instead of a long drop from a high place..Ten years I never spoke your name..Now it feels good to say it. your my friend again..Said he forgave you, I said I hated you,.He was the bigger man, I was sixteen..All the innocence it took well I guess.You finally made the year book..That year..That year..You should have taken a long break instead of a long drop,.Instead of a leap of faith, ten years I never spoke your name..Now it feels good to say that your my friend again..Your my friend again..I was angry, I was a baptist, I was a daughter, I was wrong."
"I went out looking for the answers and never left my town..I'm no good at understanding, but I'm good at standing ground..And when I asked a corner preacher I couldn't hear him for my youth..Some people get religion some people get the truth..I never get the truth, I never get the truth..I know the darkness falls on you. And it's just a point of view.When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when.You feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your.Heart can break in two, someone loves you..I lay this suitcase on my chest so I can feel somebody's weight..And I lay you to rest just to feel a give and take?.I got a new interpretation and it's a better point of view, you.Were looking for a landslide I was looking out for you, I was.Looking out for you, someone's looking out for you.I know the darkness falls on you..And it's just a point of view.When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when.You feel like giving in and the coming of the end,.Like your heart can break in two, someone loves you..I am afraid of crossing lines..I am afraid of flying blind..Afraid of inquiring minds..Afraid of being left behind..I close my eyes I think of you, I take a step I think of you,.I catch my breath I think of you, I cannot rest I think of you.My one and only wrecking ball, and you're cutting through my walls..When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and.When you feel like giving in and the coming of the end,.Like your heart could break in two, someone loves you."
When I see myself I'm seeing you too.As long as I remember and I'm feeling like I knew.That my jokes aren't funny the truth isn't true.If there was no you.If you were my boat in the deep blue sea.I probably sink you down.I know I should have thanked you for carrying me.But for you I would happily drown.Out on your way the darkest night the longest day.I know what to say to make you laugh.And nothing you could do.Could make me turn my back on you.When you're looking for a fight I'm your man.When you need a friend you got my hand.And what I really mean what IÃÂ¢??m trying hard to say.Is that I'm counting on you and you got me too.Our secrets aren't safe I'm singing out of tune.If there was no you if there was no you
"Hello I'm looking for a friend I lost some time ago.Your mother says she wants her girl back home.Sometimes you think you've found yourself you really only lost yourself.Or maybe you're afraid to be alone.But if I could see behind blue eyes.At all the things that dusty windows tried to hide.Then I could see behind the walls of Caroline.And behind blue eyes.I heard that you're in town again you surely can depend on me.To keep you out of the sun.Down and out and out and then I'm climbing up the walls again.We're standing in line to be the one.But if I could see behind blue eyes.And all the things that dusty windows tried to hide.Then I could see behind the walls of Caroline.And behind blue eyes.I've faced it.I'm wasted.Don't fly away before your time.It's phony,.You owe me.Come on don't fly away before your time.Yeah.But if I could see behind blue eyes.At all the things that dusty windows tried to hide.Then I could see behind the walls of Caroline.And behind blue eyes"
Time of day I can't recall.The kind of thing that takes it's toll.Over years and over time.Over smiles and over wine.All in all it wasn't bad.All in all it wasn't good.But I still care.That's the problem with the days.They're never long enough to say.What it is you never said.All the books you never read.I throw myself into the wind.Hoping somebody will pick me up.And carry me again.Where are you now.Do you let me down.Do you make me grieve for you.Do I make you proud.Do you get me now.Am I your pride and joy.I believe this to be true.Nothing sacred nothing new.No one tells you when its time.There are no warnings only signs.And you know that you're alone.You're not a child anymore.But you're still scared.All your mountains turn to rocks.All your oceans turn to drops.They are nothing like you thought.Can't be something you are not.Life is not a looking glass.Don't get tangled in your past.Like I am learning not to.Where are you now.Do you let me down.Do you make me grieve for you.Do I make you proud.Do you get me now.Am I your pride joy
"Around here, it's the hardest time of year.Waking up, the days are even gone.The collar of my coat.Lord help me, cannot help the cold.The raindrops sting my eyes.I keep them closed..But I'm feelin' no pain.I'm a little lonely and my quietest friend.Have I the moonlight? Have I let you in?.Say it ain't so, say I'm happy again.Say it's over, say I'm dreaming,.Say I'm better than you left me.Say you're sorry, I can take it.Say you'll wait, say you won't.Say you love me, say you don't.I can make my own mistakes.Let it bend before it breaks.I'm all right. Don't I seem to be?.Aren't I swinging on the stars?.Don't I wear them on my sleeve?.When you're looking for a crossroads,.It happens every day.And whichever way you turn,.I'm gonna turn the other way.Say it's over, say I'm dreaming,.Say I'm better than you left me.Say you're sorry, I can take it.Say you'll wait, say you won't.Say you love me, say you don't.I can make my own mistakes.Learn to let it bend before it breaks.Say it's over say I'm dreaming,.Say I'm better than you left me.Say you're sorry, I can take it.Say you'll wait, say you won't.Say you love me, say you don't.I can make my own mistakes.Let it bend before it breaks"
I swear when we touched I saw heaven in your eyes.Jewel studded clouds floating in your skies.Seas of blue and fields of green.Looking like you fell out of someone's dreams.Why do my troubles turn true.Whenever I rest my eyes on you.Why must my heartache be found.Wherever your feet are touching the ground.You could sing an army of angels to sleep.Songs that could cause the devil to weep.You hold me so sweet when the day is done.Enough to make you wonder where we all came from.Why do my troubles turn true.Whenever I rest my eyes on you.Why must my heartache be found.Wherever your feet are touching the ground.My heartache can be found.Wherever your feet are touching the ground.And out of those eyes im feeling rain.Bringing me misery and giving me pain.Curse these shackles that you put on me.Blessed be the day when you set me free.Why do my troubles turn true.Whenever I rest my eyes on you.Why must my heartache be found.Wherever your feet are touching the ground.My heartache can be found.Wherever your feet are touching the ground.My heartache can be found.Wherever your feet are touching the ground

"As soon as my eyes shut the slide show begins.Yesterday is gone now and panic sets in.With a weight upon my chest.And a ghost upon my back.And the numbing sensation of everything.I lack that leaves me.Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,.Your real world away.Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes, lie.Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes cry.Late morning lullaby.The first sign of morning is gray and alarming.It's so disappointing the day has come so soon.While the rest of the world greets the day and feels new.I will push it away just like I always do, I will be.Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,.Your real world away.Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes, lie.Only beautiful, beautiful bright eyes cry.Late morning lullaby.Late morning lullaby"
"Everything I do.Surrounds these pieces of my life.That always change.Or hey, maybe I've changed.Sometimes being happy.Can be self-destructive.Even when you're sane.Yeah you're only insane.But don't bother waking me today.Here I am.I'm so young.Hey I am bitter.I've been jaded.'Cause everyday.I bite my tongue.If you only knew.My mind was full of razors.To cut you like a.Worry from this song.This is my song.This is my song.I live everyday.Like they'll never be a last one.Till they're gone.And they're gone.I'm stick to make me your.Your attention and your friendship.And your time.So you could come and get it from now on.[Chorus:].This is my song.This is my song.[Chorus:]"
"If you had eyes like golden crowns and.Diamonds in your fingertips you'd waste it.If shining wisdom passed your lips and.Traveled to the ears of God you'd waste it.And so I hate that you're overrated most.Revered and celebrated because you'll waste it.Then again it's good to get a call.Now and then just to say hello.Have I said I hate to see you go.I hate to see you go.But ever time you close a door and nothing.Opens in its place you've wasted.And when you speak the words you know.To those who know the words themselves.You're wasted.You're such a classic waste of cool, so afraid to.Break the rules in all the wrong places.Then again it's good to get a call.Now and then just to say hello.Have I said I hate to see you go.I hate to see you go"
Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods?.And everything there feels just as it should.You're part of the life there.You're part of something good.If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods.If you've ever wandered lonlely through the woods.Have you ever stared into a starry sky?.Lying on your back you're asking why.What's the purpose I wonder who am I.If you've ever stared into a starry sky.Have you ever stared into a starry sky.Have you ever been out walking in the snow?.Tried to get back to where you were before.You always end up not knowing where to go.If you've ever been out walking in the snow.If you'd ever been out walking you would know
"There's no telling what I'd do.If I could get my hands on you.It takes a lot to make me lie.But now I know I'd like to try.Now I never know your mind.And how I'd love to keep you in line.I could smile and tell you no-o.But how I'd hate to see you go.Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh.Damn, you rattle my bones.Shake my heart like a ten-pound stone.I sometimes wish I'd left you alone.Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh.Damn, you're makin' me weep.Wake me up nights and I can't sleep.Are you gonna be the death of me?.(Hey!).I could show you who you are.I could kiss you in the dark.I could take it way too far.But I could never win your heart.Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh.Damn, you rattle my bones.Take my heart like a ten-pound stone.I sometimes wish I'd left you alone.Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh.Damn, you're makin' me weep.Wake me up nights and I can't sleep.Are you gonna be the death of me?.(Hey!) x3.There's no telling what I'd do.If I could get my hands on you.It takes a lot to make me lie.But now I know I'd like to try.Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh.Damn, you rattle my bones.Shake my heart like a ten-pound stone.I sometimes wish I'd left you alone.Oh yeaaaaahhhhhhh.Damn, you're makin' me weep.Wake me up nights and I can't sleep.Are you gonna be the death of me?.(Hey!) x4"
"Hang on, just hang on for a minute.I've got something to say.I'm not asking you to move on or forget it.But these are better days.To be wrong all along and admit is not amazing grace.But to be loved like a song you remember.Even when you've changed.Tell me did I go on a tangent?.Did I lie through my teeth?.Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?.Did I bring shame on my family?.Did it show when I was weak?.Whatever you see, that wasn't me.That wasn't me, that wasn't me.When you're lost you will toss every lucky coin you'll ever trust.And you'll hide from your god like he never turns his back on us.And you'll fall all the way to the bottom and land on your own knife.And you'll learn who you are even if it doesn't take your life.Tell me did I go on a tangent?.Did I lie through my teeth?.Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?.Did I bring shame on my family?.Did it show when I was weak?.Whatever you see, that wasn't me.That wasn't me, that wasn't me"
"Found myself today, I took my cross up and walked away.With amazing grace and opened eyes.Even though I'm born to lose my way.Tomorrow comes on a hurricane.When the weight of the world's been on your mind.In the morrow, I'll be gone.I gave it everything I had for so long.Save your sorrow for your song.Don't we always find a way to carry on.No ones sees it coming.And no one walks when they should've been running.And nothing hurts like knowing you've tried.And we can see how years can slip away.In the cold dark nights and the long hard days.But nothing aches quite like goodbye.In the morrow, I'll be gone.I gave it everything I had for so long.Save your sorrow for your song.Don't we always find a way to carry on.In the morrow, I'll be gone.I gave it everything I had for so long.Save your sorrow for your song.Don't we always find a way.In the morrow, I'll be gone.I gave it everything I had for so long.Save your sorrow for your song.Don't we always find a way to carry on.Don't we always find a way to carry on"
When I'm blowing out the candles.And when people start to sing.I will always cross my fingers tight.I'll remember everything.But I always make my wishes.For the same thing every time.If I live to be one hundred.If I ever get it right.My mind is racing with thoughts.And the songs that never end.And I prayed to God last night.Just before I went to bed.Even now I can't remember.A single word He said.If I live to be one hundred.If I get it through my head.I always think about you.And I have to close my eyes.If I live to be one hundred.Will I ever cross your mind.When you close your eyes at night.And you rise above your life.Do you notice there's an empty space.Where I wasn't by your side.Because I always dream about you.Every time I close my eyes.If I live to be one hundred.Will I ever cross your mind.I always make my wishes.For same thing every time.If I live to be one hundred.Will I ever cross your mind
"The sun came up and five years gone.Life goes on, yeah life goes on.I wonder how you're gettin' by.The sun goes down and I feel blue.Now I toss 'cause my mind's on you.And I kind of miss your broken smile.Save part of yourself for me.Won't you save part of yourself for me.I remember you and me.Lost and young and dumb and free.And unaware of years to come.Just a whisper in the dark.On the pavement in the park.You taught me how to love someone.So save part of yourself for me.Won't you save part of yourself for me.When we walk into the sun.Or burn below for what we've done.Will you still call out for me.Turn to light or fade to black.You don't look back, no you don't look back.And what you meant now born a sea.So save part of yourself for me.Won't you save part of yourself for me.The sun goes down and five years gone.Life goes on, yes life goes on.I hope you caught up with your dreams.I hope you saved part of yourself for me.Won't you save part of yourself for me.Save part of yourself for me"
"When I find the sweet hereafter.Put a blanket on my soul.Cast a shadow on my heart.Slide the chain across my door.Ever turning all the seasons.Ever fading all the days.And if there ever was a reason.I just haven't found a way.To fall like rain.Fall like rain.Fall like rain.Fall like rain.Only to rise again.I was longing for the wind.When the trees began to sway.But I never grow my wings.No, I'll never fly away.For the anchor of my love.To which my heart is bound.Is the iron for the cage.That keeps me on the ground.To fall like rain.Fall like rain.Fall like rain.Fall like rain.Only to rise again.I'm dreaming to myself.With a tear behind my eye.For a shelter is my mind.In the quiet of the night.Ever turning all the seasons.Ever fading all the days.And if there ever was a reason.I just haven't found a way.To fall like rain.Fall like rain.Fall like rain.Fall like rain.Only to rise again"
I still talk to you in my sleep.I don't say much 'cause the hurt runs too deep.I gave you the moon and the stars to keep.But you gave them back to me.The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep.But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep.I still lay on my side of the bed.I dance alone when the last bottle's spent.Memories like a river runnin' through my head.I'll have me an ocean before I'm dead.The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep.But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep.I still whisper sweet words to you.And when I'm busy with nothing to do.I pray to God that my words ring true.And that your words might reach me too.The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep.But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep.I can't keep it.My heart's in pieces so please understand.I'm tryin' to jump but I've nowhere to land.So give me your heart and I'll give you my hand.And try as goddamn hard as I can.The hill I'm walkin' up is gettin' good and steep.But I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep.I can't keep it
all of these lines across my face.tell u the story of who i am
"I've been down with a broken heart.Since the day I learned to speak.The devil gave me a crooked start.When he gave me crooked feet.But Gabriel don came to me.And kissed me in my sleep,.And I'll be singing like an angel.Until I'm six feet deep.I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign.I set my mind a wandering and I walk a broken line.You have a mind to keep me quiet.And although you can try,.Better men have hit their knees.And bigger men have died.I'm gonna raise, raise hell.There's a story no one tells.You gotta raise, raise hell.Go on and ring that bell.You came upon a lightning strike.And eyes of bright clear blue.I took that tie from around my neck.And gave my heart to you.I sent my love across the sea.And though I didn't cry.That voice will haunt my every dream.Until the day I die.I'm gonna raise, raise hell.There's a story no one tells.You gotta raise, raise hell.Go on and ring that bell.I dug a hole inside my heart.To put you in your grave.At this point it was you and me.And mama didn't raise no slave.You took my face in both your hands.And looked me in the eye.And I went down with such a force.That in your grave I lie.I'm gonna raise, raise hell.There's a story no one's telling.You gotta raise, raise hell.Go on and ring that bell.Go on and ring that bell.Go on and ring that bell.Go on and ring that bell"
"Maybe you thought.I hung the moon.Maybe you thought.We were Johnny and June.Maybe we thought.It was just us two.Maybe we spoke too soon.We never lie.And we don't tell tales.We bite our tongues.And our fingernails.We fall in love.And we don't fall out.Maybe we speak too soon.Here's you and me.And in between, we draw a line.But we can't see where it's been.We scratch our heads.And race against the heart's content.Oh oh oh, oh yeah.Maybe we hurt who we love the most.Maybe it's all we can stand.Maybe we walk through the world as ghosts.Break my own heart before you can.Here's you and me.And in between, we draw a line.But we can't see where it's been.We scratch our heads.And race against the heart's content.Oh oh oh, oh yeah.Maybe we know how the story ends.Maybe it's not even about us.We both retreat to opposing sands.And the love lives on without us.One thing I know for sure is.Love will find a way.Love will find a way.Here's you and me.And in between, we draw a line.But we can't see where it's been.We scratch our heads.And race against the heart's content.Oh oh oh oh.You and me.Oh oh oh oh.You and me.Oh oh oh oh.You and me.Oh oh oh, oh yeah"
My grandpa gave me a wee penny and I kept it in my pocket.I had big plans in my backyard to build me a space rocket.I talked to my brother on a fake C-P that I made from a Tic-Tac box.Packed my snowballs nice and tight and in the middle I put rocks.Don't trade in your Tic-Tac box for a ball on the end of a chain.And don't go spending Grandpa's pennies buying into the game.You gotta keep your heart young.Don't go growin' old before your time has come.You can't take back what you have done.You gotta keep your heart young.Dad took the wheels off of my bike and he pushed me down the hill.But speed got the best of me and I took my first spill.That was back when alcohol was only used on cuts.Stung like hell so I shook my leg and mama said it would give me guts.Don't trade in your Tic-Tac box for a ball on the end of a chain.And don't go spending Grandpa's pennies buying into the game.You gotta keep your heart young.Don't go growing old before your time has come.You can't take back what you have done.You gotta keep your heart young.So take a picture of the one you love and put it in a locket.Go dig up your time capsule and the blueprints for your rocket.Keep in touch on a fake C-P and that same old Tic-Tac box.Pack your snowballs a little less tight but in the middle still put rocks.And keep your heart young.Don't go growing old before your time has come.You can't take back what you have done.You gotta keep your heart young.You gotta keep your heart young.Sometimes you don't die quick.Just like you wished you'd done.Though love is a loaded gun.You've gotta keep your heart young.You can't take back what you have done.You gotta keep your heart young
I've been gone for so long.And how I missed you.My heart was aching for home.And then one night as I lay down.Somewhere far from you.I dreamt that I heard you call my name.But my mind was playing games.I knew right then that I'd return.To where I was before.And I was so tired of being away.That I just couldn't stay anymore.What did I ever come here for?.Oh no no no no no.What did I ever come here for?.I thought if I showed up in the night.In my best disguise.There at your doorway in your porch light.That you would look into my eyes.And you would realize who I am.Put your arms around me.You're gonna love me so much more.Than you ever did before.What did I ever come here for?.Oh no no no no no.What did I ever come here for?.It wasn't too long before.I showed up at your door.I'd been gone a thousand miles.I didn't know how much more I could stand.If I could stand at all.You said I looked like I'd been through World War Two.And my soul was worn right through.I thought you would read my mind.I thought you'd ask me to stay.You'd never turn me away like before.But you closed your door anyway
"So this is how the story went.I met someone by accident.That blew me away.That blew me away.It was in the darkest of my days.When you took my sorrow and you took my pain.And buried them away, you buried them away.And I wish I could lay down beside you.When the day is done.And wake up to your face under the morning sun.But like everything I've ever known.I'm sure you'll go one day.So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away.And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away.I dropped you off at the train station.And put a kiss on top of your head.I watched you wave.I watched you wave.Then I went on home to my skyscrapers.Neon lights and waiting papers.That I call home.I call it home.And I wish I could lay down beside you.When the day is done.And wake up to your face against the morning sun.But like everything I've ever known.I'm sure you'll go one day.So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away.And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away.I woke up feeling heavy hearted.I'm going back to where I started.The morning rain.The morning rain.And you know I wish that you were here.But that same old road that brought me here.Is calling me home.Is calling me home.And I wish I could lay down beside you.When the day is done.And wake up to your face against the morning sun.But like everything I've ever known.You'll disappear someday.So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away.And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away"
"Were we just kids, just starting out.Didn't we know then love was about.Were we just fooling, playing around.Were we ever gonna get out of this town.Move to Seattle, stay up all night.That was when bedtime was our biggest fight.All in a moment, all in a sound.All in a day's work, we're tumbling down.Down by the old school, trash in the street.Searching the eyes of the strangers we meet.Asking will it get better?.Will we be alone?.Turning the wheels of our bicycles home.Over the rainbow, out in the snow.Learning to walk with the sand in our toes.Long to be tall, kissed when you fall.Hopping that someone will come when you call"
"There never was a better love.To see the light of day.If only just to lift you up.And rise above the grey.It breaks my heart, but now you know.That the broken binds are an open door.And if it all disappears.I promise you I'll still be there.My growing pain, my darkest days.I owe them all to you.For every break I've got you to thank.For always pulling me through.If it breaks your heart, at least you know.That the broken binds are an open door.And if it all disappears.I promise you I'll still be there.But if the world should let you down.If the sky should fall and never make a sound.Oh if it all disappears.I promise you I will be there.It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart.It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart.But now you know.That the broken binds are an open door.And if it all disappears.I promise you I will be there.But if the world should let you down.If the sky should fall and never make a sound.Oh if it all disappears.I promise you I will be there.Oh if it all disappears.You have my word I will be there.And if it all disappears.I promise you I will be there"
"Oooh.I sometimes lose my faith in luck.I don't know what I want to be when I grow up.I just count the rain.Wearing the floor through the boards again.I wish I could find a soul to steal.I could be the engine, you could be the wheel.And when we're driving home, I never have to worry about being alone.Oooh, I'll follow my tracks.See all the times I should have turned back.Oooh, I wept alone.I know what it means to be on my own.Oooh, the things I've known.Looks like I'm taking the hard way home.Oooh, the seeds I've sown.Taking the hard way home.Taking the hard way home.I never did learn how to follow the rules.I never was good at sleeping while the moon was full.I just lie and burn.Wreck my mind while the planet turns.I sometimes wish I could start again.I'd try and do the right things every now and then.I'd step in line.That's what I would do if I could turn back time.Oooh, I'll follow my tracks.See all the times I should have turned back.Oooh, I wept alone.I know what it means to be on my own.Oooh, the things I've known.Looks like I'm taking the hard way home.Oooh, the seeds I've sown.Taking the hard way home.Taking the hard way home.ooh.I'll tell you how I want to live.Forget about the take.Forget about the give.I want to leave this town.Fake my death and never be found.Oooh, I'll follow my tracks.See all the times I should have turned back.Oooh, I wept alone.I know what it means to be on my own.Oooh, the things I've known.Looks like I'm taking the hard way home.Oooh, the seeds I've sown.Taking the hard way home.Taking the hard way home.I sometimes lose my faith in luck.I don't know what I want to be when I grow up.I just count the rain.Wearing the floor through the boards again.I wish I could find a soul to steal.I could be the engine, you could be the wheels.When we're driving home, I never have to worry about being alone.Oooh, the things I've known.Looks like I'm taking the hard way home.Oooh, the seeds I've sown.Taking the hard way home.Taking the hard way home.Taking the hard way home"
"Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age.When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave.And senorita play guitar, play it just for you.My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through.You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun.You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun.And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun.I've no wish to be living sixty years on.Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again.I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same.And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you.Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through.And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun.I've no wish to be living sixty years on"
"Long is the day, take it away.Hold it up and you don't let it fall.Cause devils play, was yesterday.And I don't care about that at all.I just smile, once in a while.Because I don't want the lines on my face.I sit right here, holding the years.And I count all the stars in space.You fall apart again and you can find a friend.Don't turn to someone else because they won't understand....Self respect, goes unexpressed.I don't dream because I cannot sleep.And I think the world of myself.But the world doesn't think much of me.As long as the day is full of time, there will always be room.For your hand in mine.You fall apart again and you can't find a friend.Don't turn to someone else because they won't understand.I don't want to hear.You say that you miss yesterday.If you don't like what you see.That means nothing to me.No one's home I'm alone with my music and my TV.And I still say that yesterday is best when left to sleep.You fall apart again and you can't find a friend.Don't turn to someone else because they won't understand.I don't want to hear.You say that you miss yesterday.If you don't like what you see.That means nothing to me"
"Dear Love, I miss you much..I miss your smile, and I miss your touch,.But I found a place where I can erase my past..Maybe someday when you're old and gray,.And your hair falls out and your tattoos fade,.You might see my standing, hat in hand..I have to go away, I've got no reason to stay here..You said someday you'll change,.But even a fool would tell you,.Someday never comes..You built your rooms, you built your walls,.You kept me outside, of it all..I got tired of you, what's a girl to do..Maybe someday if we stay this way,.And you see my face in a different place,.You'll remember when..You're going to thank me then..I have to go away, I've got no reason to stay here..You said someday you'll change,.But even a fool would tell you.Someday never comes."
It's hard to let the miles pass me by.Yellow lines that blend together in my eyes.And when the seasons change again then I will too.I just want to be closer to you.I'm staring out at endless rows of green.There are miles of hay like I have never seen.Just when you think you've had enough and.your dreams come true.I just want to be closer to you.My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from.I tried not to let you down.Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong.Help me get my feet back on the ground.Tomorrow I'll be lying under you.With a heart of gold and arms to fall into.I know that there might come a day.where my life is through.But I just want to be closer to you.My mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from.I tried not to let you down.Now I wonder if I've been doin' something wrong.Help me get my feet back on the ground.Someday we might learn to tell the truth.We might even find the fountains of our youth.We all needed something real we all need proof.I just want to be closer to you.I only want to be closer to you
"Look to the clock on the wall.Hands hardly moving at all.I can't stand the state that I'm in.Sometimes it feels like the wall's closing in.Oh, Lord, what can I say?.I'm so sad since you went away.Time, time, ticking on me.Alone is the last place I wanted to be.Lord, what can I say?.Trap all my troubles away.Drown my sorrow the same way.Seems no matter how hard I try.It seems like there's something just missing inside.Oh, Lord, what can I say?.I'm so sad since you went away.Time, time, ticking on me.Alone is the last place I wanted to be.Lord, what can I say?.Oh, Lord, what can I say?.How many rules can I break?.How many lies can I make?.How many roles must I turn.To find me a place where the bridge hasn't burned?.Oh, Lord, what can I say?.I'm so sad since you went away.Time, time, ticking on me.Alone is the last place I wanted to be.Oh, Lord, what can I say?.I'm so sad since you went away.Time, time, ticking on me.Alone is the last place I wanted to be.Lord, what can I say?.Oh, Lord, what can I say?"
"Life is too short to waste all your time.Running too quickly to the finish line..Time is a track that's ready and set.And the longer you live, the closer you get to being.Gone, gone like the evening.Sun, sun when it sets.Gone, gone like the darkness.At dawn, and then they forget.There's no guarantees or promise of wealth.When you're only allowed so much time on the shelf.Time isn't money, it's only a lie.Because everything lost can be found but you're.Gone, gone like the evening.Sun, sun when it sets.Gone, gone like the darkness.At dawn, and then they forget.But live in doubt, live in fear,.And you might live forever.Or live it up and watch your back.And you might live for better.Gone, gone like the evening.Sun, sun when it sets.Gone, gone like the darkness.At dawn, and then they forget"
"I don't hang around that place no more.I'm tired of wearing circles in the floor.And I don't carry myself very well.But I've gotten so much braver,.Can you tell?.I'm happy, can't you see?.I'm all right, but I miss you, Amber lee.And I lined my secrets up all one by one.I put em all away when I was done.And I would really love to hear your voice sometime.To close a little distance in my mind.I'm happy, can't you see?.I'm all right, but I miss you, Amber Lee.Where have you been all these years?.And how could you just disappear?.And when did you stop missing me?.I'm happy, can't you see?.I'm all right, but I miss you, Amber Lee.I'm all right, but I miss you, Amber Lee"
"Sorry I'm only.Human you know me.Grown up oh no guess again.My days always.Dry up and blow away.Sometimes I could do that too.But make no mistake that.When you need a friend.You could count on anyone.But you know I'll defend.The tragedy that we knew as.The end.Progress, changing.Growing then giving up.Somehow we're never quite prepared.But I understand it.When you need a friend.You could count on anyone.But you know I'll defend.The tragedy that we knew as.The end.So taking you with me would be like.Taking all your money to the grave.It does no good to anyone especially.The one you're trying to save.But it's so hard not to save.When you need a friend.You could count on anyone.But you know I'll defend.The tragedy that we knew as.The end"
"When you're near me I have no fear.When I'm untrue you see right through me.You know me as deep as the sea goes.Calm my head whenever the storm blows.When the stars, and the moon.And the sky, fall through.I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow.Deep as the sea goes, all I know is.I would throw it all away...away.In my restless hour I'm holding.The words you say that lay my soul to sleep.I dream of buildings that burn.The sky turns black I toss and turn.When the stars, and the moon.And the sky, fall through.I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow.Deep as the sea goes, all I know is.I would throw it all away, away.This love branches out like an oak tree.Reach for the sky and roots to the sea.So when you're shaken down and broken.Find some peace of mind in knowing.I'd throw them all away when I'm hollow.Deep as the sea goes, all I know is.I would throw it all away, away"
"Hold me down, lift me up,.There's someone on the bedside waiting there for me..I hear my name, I turn around,.There's gotta be a downside, something I don't see.Around me..Hide me..Dying in the light of the room.Blind side, please..I don't really want to be seen in my own eyes.Something's wrong, awake all night..'cause I can feelthe dark side closing in on me..Do you see me as I see myself?.I promise there's a downside, something you can't see.About me..Hide me..Dying in the light of the room.Blind side, please..I don't really want to be seen in my own eyes..Lost in translation, free to fall,.One situation, and lose it all..Hide me..Dying in the light of the room.Blind side, please..I don't really want to be seen in my own eyes."
"Follow your heart and see where it might take you.Don't let the world outside there break you.They know not who you are inside.They never felt your yell.Don't ever let them crack.Hold out, I know you feel it getting cold out.With all the blankets for your soul and.Before you know it you'll be frozen.And you'll have to see this through.There's no one here but you.I feel the rain comin' down.And it reminds me of who I used to be.But now there's nothing more than a memory.Don't go to sleep and try because.Tomorrow baby if you let it, it will swallow you up.And none of this will matter, will matter anymore.I feel the rain comin' down.It reminds me of who I used to be.But now there's nothiing more than a memory.I feel the rain comin' down.It reminds me of who I used to be.But now there's nothing more than a memory.Follow your heart and see where it might take you.Don't let the world outside there break you.They know not who you are inside.They never felt your yell.Don't ever let them crack your shell"
"All of these lines across my face.Tell you the story of who I am.So many stories of where I've been.And how I got to where I am.But these stories don't mean anything.When you've got no one to tell them to.It's true, I was made for you.I climbed across the mountain tops.Swam all across the ocean blue.I crossed all the lines, and I broke all the rules.But, baby, I broke them all for you.Oh because even when I was flat broke.You made me feel like a million bucks.You do.I was made for you.For you.You see the smile that's on my mouth.It's hiding the words that don't come out.And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed.They don't know my head is a mess.No, they don't know who I really am.And they don't know what.I've been through like you do.And I was made for you.And all of these lines across my face.Tell you the story of who I am.So many stories of where I've been.And how I got to where I am.But these stories don't mean anything.When you've got no one to tell them to.It's true, I was made for you.It's true that I was made for you"
"Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come with talk with you again.Because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping.And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains.Within the sound of silence.In restless dreams I walked alone, narrow streets of cobblestone.Neath the halo of a streetlamp, I turned my collar to the cold and damp.When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light, split the night.And touched the sound of silence.And in the naked light I saw, ten thousand people, maybe more.People talking without speaking, people hearing without listening.People writing songs that voices never shared, and no one dared.To stir the sound of silence.Fool, said I, you do not know, silence, like a cancer, grows.Hear my words and I might teach you, take my arms then I might reach you.But my words, like silent raindrops fell, and echoed in the wells of silence"
"Gone.It's hard for me to see when I'm wrong.It's hard for me to weep when I'm strong.But I could never sleep when you're gone.Oh but still.If you were gonna crucify me.I wouldn't want nobody to see.Cause you could kick me hard when I'm down.Down, down, down.[Chorus].I don't want wanna be.Nobody's fool.I've played that part so many times before.How I long to be.A shadow on the wall.I will make no sound at all.And when the sun goes down.The shadow on the wall.It cannot be seen at all.At all.Over it.Hey it's not that you would mess with my head.I believe that you believe what you said.You think you know me best and you care.But that's not fair!.Cause I don't really want to be safe.It must have been the way I was raised.Sleep with one eye open I say.Hey hey hey.[Chorus].Oh.How I long to be.A shadow on the wall.I would make no sound at all.At all"
There's a candle in the corner.It keeps reminding me of you.It's how you lit it on my birthday.Sometimes I miss the things you do.But then you'd turn on me if the wind blew.And you'd sting me with a glare.And your thirst was so insatiable.Just to quench it robbed me bare.I'm on broken glass.My bitter pill.That you'll love me I know.I been wasting time on climbing hills.So you'll love me I know.Someday you will.........fall on my knees.Cross-legged by the fireplace.I play guitar while you read.My patience ran so thin with you.Always toying with my head.Some how it made you strangely gleeful.To see me longing for your touch.And I still fail to see the humor in my loving you so much.I'm on broken glass.My bitter pill.That you'll love me I know.I been wasting time on climbing hills.So you'll love me I know.Someday you will.........fall on my knees.I said we're faced with the facts and it's a high price to pay.C'mon blue eyes that tell me you can't walk away.If there's nothing to lose then there's nothing to gain.C'mon stay here tonight don't drive home in the rain.And I fall on my knees.All my pride is in your hands.We're not so strong and we've mislaid our plans.I taste the shame and I'll take the blame.If it's my cross to bear.I'm on broken glass.My bitter pill.That you'll love me I know.I been wasting time on climbing hills.So you'll love me I know.Someday you will.........fall on my knees
I watch you grow away from me in photographs.And memories like spies.And salt betrays my eyes again.I started losing sleep and gaining weight.And wishing I was was ten again.So I could be your friend again.These days we go to waste like wine.That's turned to turpentine.It's six AM and I'm all messed up.I didn't mean to waste your time.So I'll fall back in line.But I'm warning you we're growing up.I heard you found some pretty words to say.You found your little game to play.And there's no one allowed in.Then just when we believe we could be great.Reality it permeates.And conquers from within again.These days we go to waste like wine.That's turned to turpentine.It's six a.m and I'm all messed up.I didn't mean to waste your time.So I'll fall back in line.But I'm warning you we're growing up
"Now, I've heard there was a secret chord.That David played, and it pleased the Lord.But you don't really care for music, do ya?.It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth.The minor fall, the major lift.The baffled king composing hallelujah.[Chorus].Hallelujah, hallelujah.Hallelujah, hallelujah.Your faith was strong but you needed proof.You saw her bathing on the roof.Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya.She tied you to her kitchen chair.She broke your throne, and she cut your hair.And from your lips she drew the hallelujah.[Chorus].Well baby, I've been here before.I've seen this room and I've walked this floor.You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya.And I've seen your flag on the marble arch.And love is not a victory march.It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.[Chorus].Well, there was a time when you let me know.What's really going on below.But now you never show that to me, do ya?.But remember when I moved in you.And the holy dove was moving too.And every breath we drew was hallelujah.[Chorus].Maybe there is a God above.But all I've ever learned from love.Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya.And it's not a cry that you hear at night.It's not somebody who's seen the light.It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.[Chorus].Hallelujah , hallelujah"

"I done some bad bad things.The kind you don't bring up at confession.Somewhere in my life, woah.I took the wrong direction.I swear on my soul.I didn't want to hurt no one.But I got no way to justify.The things I done.If you're good at telling lies.You could be my alibi.And I won't have to atone for my sins.If you're good at telling lies.You could be my alibi.And I won't have to the fall for where I've been.You done some bad bad things.The kind that don't bare to mention.Something inside you died.Now you need some resurrection.If you don't want to go down.Just like the setting sun.You got to find a way to reconcile.The things you done.If you're good at telling lies.You could be my alibi.And I won't have to atone for my sins.If you're good at telling lies.You could be my alibi.And I won't take to the fall for where I've been.If you're good at telling lies.You could be my alibi.And I won't take to the fall for where I've been.I swear some people in the world.They got no moral compass.I know the wicked ones.I feel them walk among us.The hangman begs for mercy.Only when his time has come.Because he got no way to.Rectify the things he done.If you're good at telling lies.You could be my alibi.And I won't have to atone for my sins.If you're good at telling lies.You could be my alibi.And I won't have to the fall for where I've been.I won't take the fall for where I've been.I won't take that fall for where I've been, no"
"You came into this world with eyes as clear as water.You didn't look a thing like your grandmother's daughter.With a heart so heavy and beating like a drum.Yeah, neither did you look like your grandfather's son.(We're chained) And when everything changes our love will stay the same.(We're chained) And when everything else goes away, our love will still remain.We're chained.Wilder than a brushfire burns deep inside the bramble.Baby, I think God made your soul born to ramble.Maybe you'll take to the far away places.Where life is gonna deal you a hand full of aces.But it doesn't really matter how great the spaces.(We're chained) And when everything changes our love will stay the same.(We're chained) And when everything else goes away, our love will still remain.We're chained.Life has a fuse and it burns with quickness.But death ain't the long twisted branch of sickness.Just as the spark gives birth to a flame.We'll be bound by our love and then the family name.(We're chained) And when everything changes our love will stay the same.(We're chained) And when everything else goes away, our love will still remain.We're chained"
"I have seen the fire watcher's daughter.Watching fires burn from smoke to black.There's nothing she won't burn.From Styrofoam to urns, to someone else's ashes in a sack.You can scorch the metal, you can even melt the glass.You can pass the time here, fire lives into the past.An all-consuming flame, that refines and new begins.It'll take your family heirlooms,.But it can take your darkest sins.It's a good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die.And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes.Condemn their sons to Hades.And Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well.But there ain't no hell for a fire-watcher's daughter.We exercise the demons of the things we used to know.The gnashing of the teeth become the remnants of our homes.We think we're moving on, from materials we long.To forget we ever sold our souls to own.There's a chilling absolution that we're given from our birth.A powerful delusion and a plague upon the earth.But nothing scares me more.Than the stranger at my door.Who I fail to give shelter, time, and worth.Let the good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die.And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes.Condemn their sons to Hades.And Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well.But there ain't no hell for a fire-watcher's daughter"

Last night I had the exact same dream as you.I killed a bird to save your life.And you gave me your shoes.You said clip my wings and walk my miles.And I said I would too.Then I woke up but I wasn't gonna tell you.Today I sang the same damn tune as you.It was lady in red I hate that song.And I know you do too.You didn't catch me singin' along.But I always sing with you.Nice and quietly cuz I don't want to stop you.I know I could be spending a little too much time with you.But time and too much don't belong together like we do.If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I see the world the exact same way that you do.We lend our hands and take our stance.In tandem when we do.But I lied and said I knew the way.I hid my eyes from you.I still don't know why I probably didn't want to scare you.I know I could be spending a little too much time with you.But time and too much don't belong together like we do.If I had all my yesterdays I'd give 'em to you too.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I'm gonna die the exact same day as you.On the Golden Gate Bridge I'll hold you hand.And howl at the moon.Scrape the sky with tired eyes.And I will come find you.And I ain't scare cuz I'm never gonna miss you.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I belong to you now.I belong to you.I belong to you now.I belong to you
You're still alive inside somewhere.Or are you just remains?.You're blood muscle skin and bone.So people cause you pain.But when the skies are crashing down.And when my days are dark and grey.When my fires are burning low.When the life inside me fades.I know that I can count on you.Because you never let me lie.You bring the truth back to me now.You bring my back to life.I need somebody strong.For when I'm feeling weak.With an open heart that can listen.For when my soul is too tired to speak.I need somebody strong.For when I'm feeling weak.With an open heart that can listen.For when my soul is too tired to speak.There's a place I call my home.Where the sun falls down on me.The light fills in the shadows there.And peace of mind is free.But far below that place.A tear forms in my eye.The shadows have no foe there.And darkness multiplies.I know that I can count on you.Because you've never lead me astray.You bring the truth back to me now.You always light my way.I need somebody strong.For when I'm feeling weak.With an open heart that can listen.For when my soul is too tired to speak.I need somebody strong.For when I'm feeling weak.With an open heart that can listen.For when my soul is too tired to speak.I need somebody strong.For when I'm feeling weak.With an open heart that can listen.For when my soul is too tired to speak.I need somebody strong.For when I'm feeling weak.With an open heart that can listen.For when my soul is too tired to speak
"Broken sticks and broken stones.Will turn to dust just like our bones.It's words that hurt the most now isn't it.Are you sad inside, are you home alone.If I could just pick up the phone.Maybe you could see a better day.And you won't waste away.Under my watchful eye.Because I'm your hero and you're my weakness.Who's gonna break my fall.When the spinning starts.The colors bleed together and fade.Was it ever there at all.Or have I lost my way.The path of least resistance.Is catching up with me again today.I'm broken down, not good enough.The broken promises add up.To twice their weight in tears which I have caused.I'm afraid to sink, I'm afraid to swim.I'm sad to say I miss my friends.I know that I'm supposed to step away.But they need me to stay and keep a watchful eye.On all my heroes and all their demons.But who's gonna break my fall.When the spinning starts.The colors bleed together and fade.Was it ever there at all.Or have I lost my way.The path of least resistance.Is catching up with me again.Not today.Not today.Was it ever there at all.And have I lost my way.The path of least resistance.Is catching up with me again today.Broken sticks and broken stones.Will turn to dust just like our bones again today.I'm broken down.Not good enough.The broken promises add up again today.Was it ever there at all.And have I lost my way.The path of least resistance.Is catching up with me again today.Again today"
"I'm like the rain in a downpour.I wash away what you long for.And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes.I wish I could be there tonight.I'm like the wind in the canyon.I'm there when I'm gone in a second.You're growing older in peace where you're at.I wish I could be there for that.But I've moved on.Like a rolling stone.In a crowded room.I'm alone.I'm like the rain in a downpour.I wash away what you long for.And I wave goodbye with the sun in my eyes.I wish I could be there tonight.Oh, oh, yeah.You're like the tide in the deep blue.Cause you're always there when I need you.And when you need someone to carry you through.I'm gonna be there for you.I'm gonna be there for you"
"I don't mind.If my heart don't beat and.The sun don't shine.They'll get theirs.You'll get yours and I'll get mine.It used to be that everything was easy.Now it's lost and nobody believes me.Am I losing heart.Have I frozen it, oh yeah.Am I pushing too hard.Have I started to forget.I'm alright.Am I made of steel.Am I locked up tight.I'm human.But I'm wide awake and afraid to fight.It used to take nothing to amaze me.But now I'm older and.It doesn't even phase me.Am I losing heart.Have I frozen it, oh yeah.Am I pushing too hard.Have I started to forget.It used to be that everything was easy.Now it's lost and nobody believes me.Am I losing heart.Have I frozen it, oh yeah.Am I pushing too hard.Have I started to forget"
"I was born when I met you.Now I'm dying to forget you.And that is what I know.Though I dreamed I would fall.Like a wounded cannonball.Sinking down with my heart in tow.Bright lights like white lightning.Who shot me down.Who will cut me down.I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around.How I'm lost.How I'm found.There's a man all alone.Telling me his friends are gone.That they've died and flown away.So I told him he was wrong.That you friends are never gone.If you look to the sky and pray.Bright lights like white lightning.Who shot me down.Who will cut me down.I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around.How I'm lost.How I'm found.Someone told me a lie.Someone looked me in the eye.And said time will ease your pain.But behold, when you fall.It's that same old cannonball.Coming back for your heart again.Bright lights like white lightning.Who shot me down.Who will cut me down.I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around.And it may come around.Until the day comes around.How I'm lost.How I'm found.I was born when I met you.Now I'm dying to forget you.And that is what I know"
"Hey there what's that in your sky.With all the pretty lights.You think I can get that high?.Hey you man, where's your motivation.And why the celebration.You've gcome to nothing, son.You wanna live until you.Die alone and will.Fly alone and will.I'm not so far below.I live beneath your sky.With tainted eyes,.I've made my mind.To live until I die.Run run run catch me if you can can can.Come and hold my hand and I'll be your biggest fan.Followers living in your hollow words.I have seen your nine to fives.Wash away your dreams"
Take me back Josephine.To that cold and dark December.I am missing someone but I don't know who.Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember.Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you.Noontime wind can you blow.For me one more time.And take me on back to the start.Where the midnight moon shines so bright.Nearly pulled us up to Heaven.By the strings of our heart.Take me back Josephine.To that cold and dark December.I am missing someone but I don't know who.Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember.Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you.Morning sun shine on me.Come light inside my window.And rest on my brow.Kiss my eyes when I sleep.And carry me back home.If my dreams will allow.Take me back Josephine.To that cold and dark December.I am missing someone but I don't know who.Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember.Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you.Take me back Josephine.To that cold and dark December.I am missing someone but I don't know who.Now I'm standing alone and I'm trying to remember.Sometimes I wonder how I ever started loving you.Someone help me understand why I'm still loving you
It breaks my heart to see a dear old friend.Go down that worn out place again.Do you know the sound of a closing door?.Have you heard that sound somewhere before?.Do you wonder if she knows you anymore?.I wrapped your love around me like a chain.But I never was afraid that it would die.You can dance in a hurricane.But only if you're standing in the eye.Where did you learn to walk?.Where did you learn to run?.Away from everything you love.And did you think the bottle.Would ever ease your pain?.Did you think that love's a foolish game?.Did you find someone else to take the blame?.I wrapped your love around me like a chain.But I never was afraid that it would die.You can dance in a hurricane.But only if you're standing in the eye.You can dance in a hurricane.But only if you're standing in the eye.I am a sturdy soul.And there ain't no shame.In lying down in the bed you made.Can you fight the urge to run for another day?.You might make it further if you learn to stay.I wrapped your love around me like a chain.But I never was afraid that it would die.You can dance in a hurricane.But only if you're standing in the eye.You can dance in a hurricane.But only if you're standing in the eye
