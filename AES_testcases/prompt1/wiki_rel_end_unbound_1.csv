"Dear local newspaper, I think effects computers have on people are great learning skills/affects because they give us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe(astronomy) and keeps us out of troble! Thing about! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever time to chat with your friends or buisness partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace ect. Just think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidde in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Rather than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or child because it gives us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of troble.

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail ""@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not posible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you amagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most buissness, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the castomer's convinence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her resturant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 wer not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there..Her research focuses on palliative care symptom management for cancer patients and their family caregivers, clinical cancer outcomes, and technology aided interventions and telehealth..The unit served along the coast at Talbot Island and Cedar Keys, then moved to Mobile..More recently, the city has experienced growth in the high-tech industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector..Commercial goods could be tractors, commercial vehicles, mobile structures, airplanes and even roofing materials..Although known as one of the best carriage horse breeds available in the early 20th century, the Carrossier Normand became extinct after the advent of the automobile, having been used to develop the French Trotter, Anglo-Norman and Norman Cob..Cochise Technology District is a school district in Cochise County, Arizona."
"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and ""boom,"" instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, ""@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future..JailbreakMe is a series of jailbreaks for Apple's iOS mobile operating system that take advantage of flaws in the Safari browser on the device, providing an immediate one-step jailbreak unlike more common jailbreaks, such as Blackra1n and redsn0w, that require plugging the device into a computer and running the jailbreaking software from the desktop..It acts as a mobile payment and discovery platform for independent coffee shops..The specialty programs include Business Law and Policy; Comparative Labor and Employment Law Policy; Constitutional Theory, History and Law; Criminal Law and Procedure; Health Law and Policy; Intellectual Property and Technology Law; International and Comparative Law; Law, Behavior and Social Sciences; Law and Philosophy; and Legal History..Christopher Frayling, who estimated the number of Eurospy films at 50, felt that they passed on such traits to the Spaghetti Western as emphasis on the technology of death, such as special weapons, the anonymity of the protagonist, the ""money = power"" equation of the villains and humorous asides that released the audience's laughter after a violent sequence..And finally, Transmetal 2's, using alien technology Megatron was able to enhance the Transmetal state beyond capable limits, also while mingling their sparks with Prime and the Original Megatrons, Optimus Primal and Megatron became somewhat of a Transmetal 2's, Optimus now being ""Optimal Optimus"" and Megatron turning into a dragon..The vans also require less manpower per execution, requiring four persons to assist with the injection and are mobile."
"I agree that computers deffinately are an advantage to our society. I think this because they help us communicate and video chat with family and friends online, used as a great tool with school work, or work purposes. Most of all for the enjoyment of children and now the fun computer games help them prepare for real life consequences,like how the game webkinz teaches kids to care for pets. ""@CAPS1 you have a @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5. ""@CAPS6, please friend request me"", I replied. Later that night, I get home and check my @CAPS2, a new notification pops up and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My entire family is on @CAPS2 and I think it's so usefull for several reasons, like making plans and parties. I hate writing invitations, but now every year for my birthday party I just type them up, taking less than five minutes. Or, for an even simpler way of sending invatations you can even just type an email or @CAPS2 message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over @CAPS2. It's so easy, you just create an event and tag all of your friends in the note. Also, it's so easy to get @CAPS13's because you automatically get notified. Technology like this drastically makes life easier. For example, have you ever gotten something new and just can't wait to show your friends? Well, now you can, in the comfort of your own home. All you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too. ""@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!"" I said. ""@CAPS15 you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty,"" says @PERSON1. I love webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were in the same exact you. As you can see, webcamming is so much easier than spending more time money, and my moms time and getting a ride over her house. Computers make life so much more convienent. Another example how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand writing and most kids won't like writing it anyways. Like myself, I type faster than I write and that's why I agree @PERCENT1 that computers benefit society. Most importantly, computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you. How impressive would that be? If I was applying for a professional position of a job, I know I'll type my resume. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, beneficial, important and fun to our society..Over the past ten years, Wood has pioneered the act of drawing and mapping with satellite navigation technology and video by treating himself as a geodesic pencil..Mobile Strike is a freemium mobile massively multiplayer online strategy video game developed and published in 2015 by Machine Zone (now known as MZ)..Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future is a book by American futurist Martin Ford..It has Technology and Media Arts College specialist school status, and became an academy on 1st September 2012..In 2013, Najafi sold its interest in Direct Brands to Pride Tree Holdings, a New York-based media and consumer technology holding company founded in 2012 and incorporated in Delaware..The size of the industry including software and information services in 2013 was worth 3060 billion RMB (about $493 billion) according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology."
"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one..The Samsung SCH-u470, or Juke and Verizon Wireless Juke, is a mobile phone offered exclusively by Verizon Wireless..Due to lack of support, it moved to the College of Information Sciences and Technology and became BizSeer..Location-based Commerce (L-Commerce) refers to the localization of products and services through mobile commerce and context aware computing technologies..The year 1701 in science and technology involved some significant events..VARAN is a wired data network technology for local data networks (LAN) with the main application in the field of automation technology..Telepresence technology is a term used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to refer to the combination of satellite technology with the Internet to broadcast information, including video in real-time from cameras used on its remotely operated vehicle (ROV) on Okeanos Explorer."
"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 I am @NUM1 and I go to naylor school. I am writing to you convince that computers have a positive effect on people. Please read the following reasons. Computers have a positive effect on people. Your able to communicate with people all over the world. When my brother goes on the computer he get's to talk to my family in @LOCATION1 I like to use skpye because when we talk to family in @CAPS1.R we use a webcam to keep in touch with my family. They teach hand eye coordination and help me in ping-pong. It help me wacth the ball in computer and I do the same in the wreak. You have lot's of access to different information, my mom found a job in the computer. Everybody have access to weather or news, Some say it's a lack of exercise. People get addicted to the computer. Some can get obese and mess with your love life. These are the reasons why I belive computers are good for society. This is why people should agree that advance in technology.

"Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at @TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're changing too, so you @MONTH1 be off to college or have to move far away for buissness. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye."" my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?.It does not have physical distribution channels, and its retail business is based online, with couriers delivering the SIM cards and mobile phones bought through the telco..Based in the Financial District in San Francisco, California, the firm focuses on technology, consumer, service, alternative and renewable energy, healthcare and internet related companies..She was a sales manager, account manager, marketing manager, marketing consultant and tutor in marketing at the Queensland University of Technology before entering politics..It offers a website interface, mobile apps for Android and iOS, and an API that helps developers build browser extensions and software applications..Hill-Rom, Inc., is a company that makes hospital beds, furniture, other health care equipment, and medical technology systems..They first appeared in Marvel Boy # 1 (1950), written by Stan Lee, as the human-like inhabitants of the planet Uranus, who became the hosts and mentors of Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson), as well as providing him with the technology which he used on Earth to become a superhero."
"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across the world. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned. Such as, hand-eye cordination. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world. Celebraties are very popular on computers or other technologies. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies. Anything you can get on any other technologies. There is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. If we did not have phones to use to call someone. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years. You can look images or videos that you haven't seen in years. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers. I wonder what it will be like?.The work of Dr. Marilyn J. Bull to help shape automobile safety law in Chile was highlighted in March 2017 by AAP News..Innovation Norway has over 500 employees worldwide and has supported maritime transportation, biotechnology, thin film, alternative fuel and many other types of projects..It makes use of GNOME technology and is meant to run on free Unix-like operating systems such as GNU/Linux, FreeBSD et al..Other events during the Energy Breakthrough include a 14-hour HPV trial for primary school students, pushcarts, the Try-Athlon, (which consists of a sprint event, an 8-hour endurance trial and an obstacle course), and the also popular Innovations in Technology category..Mobile TV Format is a colloquial and collective name for technology standards set out for broadcasting TV services to mobile devices, mostly mobile handsets for now..High-performance lagoon technology that does use aerators has much more in common with the activated sludge process."
"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1! I am an @NUM1 grade student at @PERSON1. I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benifit society. i completly disagree with these comments. let me explain... Having computers definatly benifits for all students. Sometimes kids forget their text books at school. But if they have a computer, they can just google the information. That way they get there homework done, and don't have to take a zero. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called, study island. If you havn't, i'ts a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an @CAPS2 on study island we get an @CAPS2 in one of our classes.. Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no instructions in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called synewnisia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. The piano helps my hand-eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication. Now, synewnesia isn't the only free instrument learning program. There are many others! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you acheive things later in life. Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completly true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well one day when I went on google the top search of the day was, ""weight watchers diet plan"". Also, my mom uses an online video workout website, for her bad back. So not only does the computer help for diets, they can help physical therapy also. So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benifite our society, yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But, online learning sessions can be time consuming. It helps many people figure out the right deit and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy..On 30 January 2007 the BenQ Mobile factory in Kamp-Lintfort closed, after no suitable investors for the German division had been found..Stephen R.

"You @MONTH1 find this hard to beleive, but many people think computers put a negative attitude on people. Now you @MONTH1 be saying thats not true, that everyone has a computer, but the truth is they don't and they believe it puts negative attitude on people. People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends. Did you @CAPS5 some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from differnt states who live far away. For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can make a connection because I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that I use to stay in contact with family friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I @CAPS5 that many people want to learn about people from differnt countries and this is one way to do it right now I am learning some new things about the @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. While on this wonderful adventure of learning you @MONTH1 even get yourself into a vacation adventure. A recent test was taking stating that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't @CAPS5 where. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature.These people are wrong if one is on a computer and they are chating with someone from a differnt state or country then that person might persuade them to take a visit there. For example they would be able to go to the internet type in the place they want to visit and get photographs and information about the place. As a result, people would still get to enjoy nature. Sometimes using the computer could be educational. Many people @MONTH1 disagree with that statement but its true. For example when on the computer many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @MONTH1 affect their work scheduale. This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studing. It would also help them on their reports. For example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to. As a result, the students grades would increase. I hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind. As a result for those who didn't agree with the statement that they are positive not negative I hope that you will redecide on your opion..This rally in support of the troops and against the war was held on the steps of the Alabama state capital in Montgomery on October 21, 2006.Lowery and her activism were profiled at length in the 28 January 2007 edition of the Mobile Press-Register..The year 1520 in science and technology included many events, some of which are listed here..Bisnovatyi-Kogan was a student at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology from 1958-1964..A competitive advantage may include access to natural resources, such as high-grade ores or a low-cost power source, highly skilled labor, geographic location, high entry barriers, and access to new technology..With mobile devices, this type of attack is often used to target the international mobile equipment identity (IMEI)..The company are responsible for the creation of Uniput technology which was specifically designed for HVAC application."
"Do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer? People are spending too much time on computers. Obesity is a growing problem in today's society, people need to interact with eachother, and we need to get some fresh air. Computer are ruining these things for people. Unplug yourself from your computer. More and more people are becoming obese. This is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. To our whole life, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face. Get out and get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Bring out on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most. Fresh air clear your mind. Time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to releave stress so go outside. Click turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friendsand family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing.

"Wouldnt it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country we can. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again. Looking at places far away is always an option. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even going to different countries, even different continents is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plan tickets. reserve rooms, even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk. and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't see his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, facebook, myspce, skype, etc, is allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instint, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their, it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad?.The Huawei U121, Playset and the Vodafone 716 are 3G mobile camera phones designed and manufactured by Chinese telecommunications equipment supplier Huawei..The year 1965 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below..Software applications running on desktops, corporate servers, mobile devices and embedded devices are all at risk from subversion..Since then, several theme parks all over the world have been adapting this technology to extend their existing coaster facilities..John Jacob Young Jr. (born May 29, 1962 in Newnan, Georgia) was United States Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisitions) from 2001 to 2005 and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics from 2007 to 2009..The year 1702 in science and technology involved some significant events."
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people.

The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, ""I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in @CAPS1 essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with @CAPS1 family.""

"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it does not effect on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet effects your everyday life in a good way..The Satellite Award for Outstanding Mobile Game is an annual award given by the International Press Academy as one of its Satellite Awards..NS Basic is a family of development tools for the mobile devices developed and commercially marketed by NS BASIC Corporation in Toronto, Ontario, Canada for iOS, Android, BlackBerry OS, WebOS, Newton OS, Palm OS, Windows CE, Windows Mobile and Microsoft Windows..Gordon M.

"Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some cridit insted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic..He was known as the back-room fixer dealing with technology and looking after the archives of the group..Because these mirrors are mobile and gyratory they can create perspective different in 360 degrees around it, therefore they will be used in systems that seek to create images omnidirectionals..The components arrived by train and the automobiles were assembled at the plant for delivery to local dealers..In 2014, Moneythink began licensing this technology to other partners as a means of providing more students with financial empowerment tools..He served as the Cecil B.

"Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people..Arid Agriculture University offers degree programs leading to Bachelor, Master and Ph.D. in disciplines including Food Science & Technology, Computer Sciences, Management Sciences, Pure Sciences, Agriculture, Veterinary & Animal Sciences, Social Sciences and other Arts and Fine Arts programs..President of Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), he has been an advocate for diversity of higher education in Ireland..The Gene Bomb is a 1996 book by David E.

"Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should stop using Computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, bad for the younger kids, and teens could be, talking to someone they don't know. Lexi @NUM1, says that ""she has goting facebook texts to her cell phone of other teenage kids that are excuset"". @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population teenagers have @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 chat. Any of these websites can ford photos to their mobile device. This has goting out of the hand and what ever is on the computer now will be on forever.

""@CAPS5 said cause I play with you all the time"" @PERSON2 quickly ran home and @CAPS5 told his parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6 another intraction game and told this stranger @CAPS5 lives in @LOCATION2 field and @CAPS5 goes to @LOCATION2 @CAPS7. Giving strangers you information they can trace you down and find the street you live on. We need to keep our children safe and off of the computers more so sexting, and young children stay off, so kidnapping stops.

"Dear Local Newspaper, Experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while. Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. They also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning. Most people try not to be overweight. Experts should Not try to have less people on the computer. One reason is that people can chat with one another. It can be friends, families, and more. About @PERCENT1 of people chat online with families or friends. Chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. It can make someone a better person. You can't agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand-eye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet. Using the computer this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the for a while is not a waste of time. People can you their time wisly on the computer. Surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer.

"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been running late to a party and just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Have you ever had to write a paper and there wen't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? @CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable @CAPS2 and the can be fun too. To begin with let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? @CAPS1 you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably wan't answer because they're @CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable. My mother always says to me, ""@CAPS1 you're @CAPS4 trouble finding @CAPS2, go on the computer,"" because she knows that there is all the @CAPS2 in books on the @CAPS3, and more. And it's just one click away, @CAPS4 sold that, the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable @CAPS2 In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun. For example, @CAPS5. @CAPS5 is used by teens and adults like, and for one reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. @CAPS1 you to another date and wait to see what your last friend's up the best thing to do would be to go on @CAPS5 and ask A @ORGANIZATION1 shows that in a family of five, four of them use the @CAPS3 to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. In conclusion, whether you're bored at home and it's a rainy day, or @CAPS1 you have to nght a research paper you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. Positive effects computers have - are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use..Established in 1964, the industrial estate stretches across 1,300 acres and is home to over 1,500 small and medium enterprises, specializing largely in automobile components, but also in garments and engineering products..It received its initial funding from Cross Atlantic Technology Fund (XATF), which invested $2.7 million for a 13.0% stake..Elizabeth Xu is the Chief Technology Officer for CP Group, and the CEO of CP R&D, leading the Digital Transformation for a few hundred subsidiaries with combined revenue of $45 Billion and 350,000 employees globally..The Device Description Repository (DDR) is a concept proposed by the Mobile Web Initiative Device Description Working Group (DDWG) of the World Wide Web Consortium..Typical industry areas include: digital and creative, financial, legal and business services, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, environmental technologies, tourism, global sports brands, media and real estate..In July 2017, NCS released a mobile app, ""IndiaQuake"", that disseminates realtime earthquake information."
"I saw in one of the news papers I got in the mail that had an overnight for people to state their opinion on kids computer useage. I took the idea of waiting this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things. Such as: homework assignments such as essays, sometimes peoples family members go off to was but can't use cell phones, also online job alpications. To start off with, kids have homework assignment right? Most of the time people have to do essays. I ask my mom lots of times if I can do an essay for school, she say, ""why don't you stay after to do it?"" @CAPS1 have lives so they can't stay after, also at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reasons kids use computers alot. Next,, some family members go off to war. Normally for safly and privacy, they wont let the soldiers life their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they to know their ok so they don't have to for two years. So, the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job aplications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commertials show avertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types for people, homebound, elderly, ect. But mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclution, Some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they wont see for along period of time, also school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers when ever they want..It is best known for its leading role in developing the Chinese TD-SCDMA 3G mobile telecommunications standard through subsidiary DT Mobile (formerly known as Datang Mobile)..Due to the pressures of overconsumption, population and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently..Memjet is a printing technology and components company..As he explains in his first major appearance, Hammer is the reason why many of Iron Man's supervillain enemies have access to extremely advanced technology and why these foes use their equipment for violent crimes instead of profiting by bringing the designs to market..In 2017 it claimed to be the world's largest family-history technology conference..He served as the Associate Director for Science in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President of the United States from 1995 to 1997 and was Under Secretary of Energy from 1997 to 2001 during the Clinton Administration."
"Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos, even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it let's you know things as well. The computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool. The programs teach you how to type, it is called type to learn or type for fun. Also they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it let's you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You have friends with and know who they are and won't need to figure it out. So, this is why I believe that having a computer is a good idea, and good to have. You can talk to people long distance. The computer teaches you things for life. Finally it makes you more social with people.

"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a @ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost @NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. Yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to @CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my @CAPS2 always said,"" @CAPS3 more, it builds character!"" @CAPS4 ever I get the chance I @CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids theses days can be mean with out try. You disconnect yourself from your family. Because computers attrack users, there are times where you don't pay attention to others around you. @PERCENT1 of kids donot do there home work because of computers. Thank you for your time. I think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them. They help the obesity level in the nation, let cyber bullying and inappronrate content flow around the internet and lastly block you out from the world.

"Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends.

But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog.

"Computers can affect the way people are and how they interact. Why is there a need to spend your precious life sitting in front of a compute all day?When you can be getting exercise for example going to your local gym. Computers become a distraction to your social life, thats why you should use them for emergency's and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends. Lastly you can enjoy you surrounding and appreciate life and nature. Computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things. Exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit. If your sitting in front of a computer all day your body is going to shut down and won't get the proper exercise. Sports can be just as enjoyable and helps build the human body and gives you the right amount of exercise that your body needs. Sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more. Family is a wonderful thing in life, but they don't live forever. That's why we should cherries every last moment we have with them. A complete citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends. To sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals, for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergency's and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction. Instead of using them we could be getting the right amount of exercise, and spending it with family, and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them. .Nuclear knowledge management (NKM) is knowledge management as applied in the nuclear technology field..Building upon other business disciplines, such as Management Information Systems (MIS) and Technology and Innovation Management (TIM), it seeks to provide an integrated framework for the strategic use of technology and the digital transformation of organizations..Moreover, the solution automates tasks, reduces redundant operations and distributes native information to a variety of devices like LED screens, IPTVs, advertising fasciae, mobile applications and even wearable devices..HiQ is a nationwide British retailer of automobile tires, and MoT car-servicing centers..Tafka (by its initials in Persian) is the first complete and countrywide plan for ICT (Information and Communications Technology) in Iran, the equivalent of a ""National ICT agenda (NICTA)"" in some other countries..Stone Key Partners is a boutique investment bank focused on the government and commercial technology sectors."
"Computers are the way of the future. I believe that computers benefit society. I believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online. It also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from. Lastly it teached hand-eye coordination. First computers alow you to socialize online. I know @CAPS1 I get home from school I can talk to virtually any friends online. People against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family, however, this is not true. I talk to all of my aunts via facebook and other social websites. Also @CAPS1 my parents are at work the are abile to message me over the computer with out having to go get a phone and call my house. My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get intouch easier lets say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He woulden't have to go look up a number and call me, he could just send me a message of the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education. I know that @CAPS1 I'm stuck on a problem at home, I'll just go on the computer and look up the answer. Also, @CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids, @CAPS1 doing a project, I can't getall of my information from one book so I go on the computer and look up information about the subject. This really improves students grades, because they had more resources and more information to choose from, instead of only the information in the book. My last reason is that using a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. On the computer there are many sites that have very interactive sites the you can really benefit from I know of one website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had interactive games that would actually help with things is real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball. So the computer actually helped with real life activities. To sum it all up I think computers can benefit society a lot. Like being able to communicate with your friends. Also being able to look up school work with. Lastly helping with hand-eye coordination..The South African Technology Network is a coalition between five of the South African Universities of Technology..It is also sold under the Cherry Mobile brand in the Philippines where it is known as the Ace..Currently Grameen Telecom provides mobile phones among the villagers of the country..Throughout the six-year duration of the war, weapons and technology improved rapidly, including the use of jet aircraft, radar and nuclear weapons..Medidata's customers include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, and diagnostic companies; academic and government institutions; contract research organizations; and other life sciences organizations around the world that develop and bring medical therapies and products to market..The Museum of the Moving Image (MOMI) was a museum of the history of cinema technology and media sited below Waterloo Bridge in London."
"Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I strongly believe that computers effect us in a positive way. Computers are advancing and so are their uses, computers are great and they are not our thought process or went to run around outside and play sports. Computers help us find and talk to relatives and friends they allow us to learn different things about farien places. They also are great for research! First and foremost computers are effecting us positively expesally when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted and @NUM1 years ago she really wanted to find her birth family, one year later her birth father found her on this website where you can locate family, she found her family and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have of been able to get to know them if it wasnt for the computer, speaking of communication, I was working like a dog on this big science prodject I had. we weren't able to do it in person and it @CAPS3 impossible for one person to three way four people. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done. ""@CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!"" @CAPS3 something that @CAPS3 commonly said. Over @PERCENT1 of adults complain that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 never enough time in day. That @CAPS3 a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi task so you can be on your business call and email your mother so she know that you didn't forget her birthday. In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing. @CAPS2 are many people who don't have tvs and they get their news from the internet. Also for projects, in @NUM2 grade I had to learn about @CAPS4, the country in @LOCATION2. it would take countless hours to find research in books, you will find a lot of stuff you dont need, but on the computer it @CAPS3 fast and easy. If you need to know something you can just type it in and, boom! You have it where as if you were usinf a book you would still be looking for what you need. Time @CAPS3 something that we can't afford to waste expessaly in this economy. Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer, and exersizing are not always right. I don't know about you, @PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exersizes to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions, finding routs on maps are enfuriating and take for ever. Go on the computer the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt. In conclusion computers effect us in possitive ways, more and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye in this matter, advancing computers are our friends not the enemy..The Vauxhall Velox is a six-cylinder automobile which was produced by Vauxhall from 1948 to 1965..Funnel analysis involves using a series of events that lead towards a defined goal, like from user engagement in a mobile app to a sale in an eCommerce platform or advertisement to purchase in online advertising..The Cisco acquisition of Scientific Atlanta was ranked in the top 10 of largest technology acquisitions in history and was Cisco's largest acquisition to date..Most mobile phones have a contact list feature which provides similar abilities..Members of the program have a background in technology or entrepreneurship, a strong interest in the field and a strong connection to the local entrepreneurship ecosystem..Its initial core team of technologists included Dan Geer (Chief Technical Officer) and the east coast security team from Cambridge Technology Partners (including Dave Goldsmith)."
"Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. Humans especially children, need exercise. But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. @NUM1 year olds are making facebooks! You can find @NUM2 year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their ""friends"" lie to them, about their age, another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2,@CAPS3, farmpring, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to at back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together.

"Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place. People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly. What society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition,you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease! Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it! The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well! Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want! Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing..It is also available on Open Mobile in the Caribbean..Lifewire is a technology information and advice website..Games are held at the T-Mobile Arena beginning in 2017, with previous season being held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena..More recently, Microsoft developed Office Mobile, which are free-to-use versions of Office applications for mobile devices..Thandavarayapuram Ramaswami Pachamuthu (better known as T.

"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1 you really think computers are that good? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great..Jscrambler solutions are used to protect web and mobile applications in a number of sectors including Finance, Broadcasting, Advertising, Media and Gaming..The Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) is responsible for all of the acquisition functions and programs for the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, subject to the guidelines propounded by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics..VoIP calling rates are cheap, and the technology provides convenient, often free tools, such as Asterisk and other applications..It is published by the International Code Council based in Washington, D.C., through the governmental consensus process and updated on a three-year cycle to include the latest advances in technology and safest plumbing practices..The Ford Customline is an automobile that was produced by Ford in the United States for model years 1952 to 1956..Panthermobile is a show car built for the cartoon TV series The Pink Panther Show."
"There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also it always gives you information everytime you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not everytime when you need information the computer won't give it to you. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have alot more fun adavantages. One of the most common and used thing around the world is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 is when you are communicating with another human bean over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend. There are some names for instant @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4-mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people I agree that they stay on the computer to much and became very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you from exercizing and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more, but to long is not good. There are so many things for the computer I can't name them all @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers, those are many of the things you can do on your computer. I love going on the computer time to time doing many things I have talked about. Also if you do have one than reading this @MONTH1 persuade you into getting one. My opinion is that they give you a very positive effect..The Coronet is an automobile that was marketed by Dodge as a full-size car in the 1950s, initially the division's highest trim line but, starting in 1955, the lowest trim line..Institutes of technology and polytechnics have existed at least since the 18th century, but became popular after World War II with the expansion of engineering education and technical education, associated with the new needs created by industrialization..He has worked for Microsoft Research, United States presidential campaigns, was a founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a technology and media company..It was a Palo Alto laboratory and technology incubator focusing on consumer product applications and services with a focus on the Internet..Advances in information and communications technology and visualization techniques are increasing the accessibility and usage of graphics, increasing the importance of information graphics..Examples of devices that simulate the environment of outer space include the Large Space Simulator at the European Space Research and Technology Center and The Space Simulator at the Los Alamos National Laboratory."
"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a big role in our world today. For example people use computers to get imformation, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and fined friends. I think this @CAPS6 messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers @CAPS6 messing people up @CAPS6 because of the impformation that @CAPS6 on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This @CAPS6 ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people @CAPS6 the dangerous chat rooms. This @CAPS6 not good because your not familliar with the person your talking too. The person could have posed as another person and be very hipocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasent. Like you might give them you number, adress, @CAPS2 personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, @CAPS2 ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that @CAPS6 given to thousands of people online. Another words the""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" @CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" @CAPS9 these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on..It opened in the fall of 2005 as a technology magnet school..The Bradford Durfee College of Technology was a college located in Fall River, Massachusetts..His work deals with the intersection of nature and technology, combining everyday construction materials or consumer electronics in a way that may invoke chaos or disorder, or formalism and minimalism..Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT) is an institute of higher education deemed university situated in Sector 62, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India..Associated technology used in mobile computers with external graphics cards, such as in laptops or notebooks, is called AMD Hybrid Graphics..The E.212 is a second-generation number plan used in America, extended to include the subscriber's MSIN (Mobile Subscription Identification Number) within the network's customer base."
"Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spent time on their computer. The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family.Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family. These ar my reason why i think that we shouldn't be on the computers. We should spend more time with friends family or go outside, and enjoy nature..Kellner received a BA from the University of Toledo in 1972 and a MFA from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1982..Jay also built the ""super pursuit mode"" version for the final season of the TV series; Batmobiles for 70's film and for the Batman Returns by Tim Burton film; Flintstones car..The first generation Acer Timeline models use Intel's ultra low voltage (ULV) processors and Intel's Laminar Wall Jet technology..One of the more entertaining parts of this game was the ""commercials"" said by the two announcers, with products such as Chork, Popemobile Cabs and Lobster Cola..These are cases in which a new technology is described by what it does not have, compared to an older technology..It airs on Saturday and Sunday across a range of local television stations and focuses on various issues of interest to the urban (i.e. Black) general and upwardly mobile community."
"Dear,newspaper I think that people should have computers I think that because kids play game to help them learn like math game or read and grown ups can go on websites and watch work out videos and they could pay there bills on the computer to and they dont have it in the store of kids need to do there homework computers are good for that buy thet also have bad stuff like kids say they are doing there homework but they are on youtube myspace or facebook. or other stuff but computers have more good stuff about them they bad things so that?

"Dear The @CAPS1, I understand that you have some concerns about computers. I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 idea about ""Computers"" is very well thought outside of the box.Well. We sure need computer to look up information these days. Why do we need them now and it dident existed before? Reseach shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything. Let me explain a little bit further to you what I mean. First, you can look up places, chat with friends and family. @CAPS1 oppinion about using the local internet would be that it's good only for those who knows and not trying to be mean. For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm, and never to forget about nature outside of fresh air. In conclusion, internet these days are very good for people..Shindig was the recipient of SIAA's 2013 Innovation Incubator Award as the Educator's Choice Runner-Up for Education Technology Product or Service..Ubiquiti Networks is an American technology company started in 2005..Used in Internet routing, a care-of address (usually referred to as CoA) is a temporary IP address for a mobile device..Kelly was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Technology by Coventry University..From this perspective, globalization, the shift from the manufacturing sector to the service sector, and the spread of information technology have created a new economy which demands flexibility in the workplace, resulting in the decline of the standard employment relationship, particularly for women..The year 1622 in science and technology involved some significant events."
"I completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today. Even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them. Since. new technology, and post pictures on websites where everyone can see. Also they have games for computers that people get hooked on. Lastly, there are predator online. The new technology is amazing, like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures, @CAPS1 they do have negative effects. There have been many suicides over cyber bullying. This is where people bully kids over the internet. Also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming. this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions. Also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life. There are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites. Most people actually get addicted to the game, They would play it all day if they could and if they arent playing they are wishing they could. This makes them miss out on alot of things. They might not get enough excersise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop. They could also not be spending time with family. It also might change who you are as a person. The most important thing about the use of computers is your safety. There are predator all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live. You should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online. They can and most likely will come to your house for you. It could most likely cost you or even family members your lives. Computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it. Remember not to tell anyone where you live or dont take pictures and send them that are personal. They could be all over the internet the next day. Lastly, worry about your family, grades, and health than some useless game. Be smart and safe!.Federal College of Animal Health and Production Technology, Vom is one of the Federal Colleges of Agriculture in Nigeria..Candace A.

"Dear Newspaper, I think people need computers. It helps them see the world if they can't. It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. So here is examples of these three things. Some people can't physically or mentally and can't afford to travel. Its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can't go places. But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they've never been to which can help them see the world better. But there are people who can help them see the world better. But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. Then there are people who can't afford it. So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. What happened and that it wasn't what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can't talk or see them. Someones in the military and he/she has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. Also you see a friend in facebook who you haven't seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. It can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world. Which isn't bad sure we sometimes go over board with it but it is very useful. It isn't horrible but it is sometimes bad but also sometimes good but.The Mazda trademark is split between the Japanese manufacturer where it applies to automobiles (including automobile lights and batteries) and GE for non-automotive uses..When applied to electronic communication, the principle protects not only the content of the communication, but also the information on when and to whom any messages (if any) have been sent (see: Call detail records), and in the case of mobile communication, the location information of the mobile units..These photographs regularly appear in automobile magazines..She earlier served as the Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, in the Indian Ministry of Science and Technology, and was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2007.Some credit Sharma with pioneering biotechnology research in India..Mojo is one of the ""Spineless Ones"", an alien race that is immobile without advanced technology..At an organizational level an outsourcing project would involve the tangible changes in structure, processes, technology, culture that the organization would go through to go from the current state to the desired future state."
"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad it does not rot you brain like video games. are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination. You use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for @DATE1, computers can also help you read better it has little . You could play talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to you could a website that has all songs that you like to listen yo many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out paying bills online is easyer than paying them for real. The computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with @CAPS1 opinion..Technology is a key factor to achieve better results in disaster logistics..Driven by the vital role that science and technology play in the health, environmental, and economic well-being of society, Science Debate strives to provide voters with sufficient and meaningful information on these key issues when electing people to serve in public office..His ideas about ASA have provided a new framework for research in the auditory systems of both humans and non-human animals, for behavioral and neurological studies of speech perception, for music theory, hearing aids, audio technology, and the separation of speech from other sounds by computers (CASA)..It was the only City Technology College to offer post-16 students the opportunity to study the International Baccalaureate instead of A-levels..Science Exchange's enterprise clients include major drug and biotechnology companies, including Merck, Amgen, Gilead Sciences, and Genentech..He also made sure the article had a fake quote from Ed Roberts, then president of MITS, which spelled out the name of a rival company, Processor Technology, when looking at the first letter of every word, further ensuring that the article was not traced back to him."
"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great effects that are positive towards people. This is @CAPS3 it teaches hand eye cordanation, allows people to learn about far away places, and to talk to other people online. Computers have great positive effects for everyone. Computers teach hand eye cordanation. When a person is typing they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters. Computer games help to teach this @CAPS3 in the game things happen very quickly so the person has to ee whats going on and click the correct key fast thus improving hand eye @CAPS1 greatly. Studys do show that people who use computers have a @PERCENT1 better hand eye @CAPS1 then some one who dosen't. Coumputers help hand eye @CAPS1 and they can teach you about far away places. Someone can learn about far away places by searching it up online. They will get many facts about that place. Sheral from @LOCATION4 said ""I heard some one at school mention @LOCATION2 and didn't know a thing about it so I searched it and got a ton of facts."" This shows the computer can help someone learn about foiren countrys and they can talk to people far away. Using the computer soemone could talk to you while your hundreds or thousands of miles away. Tehy can do this through e-mail of video chat. a @CAPS2 showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat @CAPS3 its faster and the two people can see each other. However either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS3 of video chat I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3 who I almost never see. This gos to show that the computer is a positive thing for people. The computer is helpful in so many ways it teaches hand eye cordniation, it allows people to learn about far away places and it allows for people to talk to other people. Computers are a great thing for everyone..The gene chosen was a therapeutic protein to demonstrate the potential of such recombinant DNA technology combined with animal cloning..OpenSesame Inc. is a Portland based educational technology company that provides an online marketplace for buying and selling SCORM e-learning courses focused primarily on employee training..Wataniya Palestine Mobile Telecommunication Company doing business as Wataniya, is one of the two mobile network operators in Palestine (the other being Jawwal), founded in November 2009..By embedding the SWAF compiler into the HTML file, the user can make use of SWAF tags, elements and properties to develop a mobile web application..DC Web Women (DCWW) is a nonprofit professional organization for women in technology and new media based in the Washington, DC area..Netpulse is an American fitness technology company, and a provider of branded mobile apps for health clubs."
"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows.

"Dear Newspaper, In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. @CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people? Go and talk to them in real life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go.

"According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out @MONEY1 @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to eachother face to face anymore. They all talk on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Commmunities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, ther spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provides financial, health, and community benefits.

"Some of you @MONTH1 agree that computers don't keep you fit or we spend too much time on them but, they can help you keep in touch with friends and family, meet new people, and save information. Without these important technology devices we wouldn't be able to do any of these things. Most families live all over the country @MONTH1 be even in another country, and you don't get to see them very often because of traveling prices, however with the computer they can help us keep in contact with them very easy and quicker than you can say ""@LOCATION1."" @CAPS1 more people make a website that allows us to easily keep up with our distant family. Facebook, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 of fish, and singles net are all sites that you can find friends or the one that's right for you. This gives you a chance to discover @CAPS1 people with the same interest as you. Half of my mom's boyfriends were from these sites.

"As time goes on, our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology, such as the television. What I really want to write about is the computer. Society today has developed a very unhealthy habit, and it is always using the computer. Everyone in the twenty first century uses a computer. The world got so used to having the computer around, that if all the computers in the world were to ""break,"" then most people probably would not know how to @CAPS2. Like the basic theory of. Which was that the world was ""@CAPS1"" to end back in the year two-thousand because everyone thought that the world was going to end. Only because the computer were going to crash and lose all the data that we have ever recorded. Humanity relies way to much on the computer. Since many people rely on the computer to @CAPS2, a lot of people ""forget"" to excersise! Our body needs excersise to live. Excersise one of the most important activities in our daily lives. When you don't excersise, and all you do is eat junk food and drink today, you better bet on your mothers grave that your going to either get diabetes, the fly, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it, why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an ""innocent"" invention. Now a days, people literally worship the computer like it is a @CAPS3. People who use the computer all day every day, end becoming very lazy, because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity. Whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active atleast three times a week for many reason, fact is, that if you excersise three times a week at the least, that your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. excersise can be fun, as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. excersise should be a huge part of your daily routine, now sitting on your buttox all day searching pointless videos on ""youtube.""

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be to much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. But add to that the imense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien.

"Dear, @CAPS1 I would like to tell you something. Throughout the ages we have been evolving, from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly. With evoloution we discovered technology and in recent years we have been making new technologies rapidly. Some say that some technology like computers are bad, I think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about for away places. let you talk to people online and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers let you go places that you ordinarilly wouldn't be able to go to. If you were doing a research projects on @LOCATION1 and you didn't have any books what would you use? That's right, a computer the internet would have the facts you needed, so you could grade. While on the internet you could talk to friends and family who @MONTH1 live for away. The computer goes over long distances and connects both computers so you can bend writing almost instantly. Without computers you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people. Using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. It helps you with your hand-eye coordination. When you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body. Some people say that when you are on the computer you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. I myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too!

Not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer all I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before I now believe the computer takes time away from family time to get the sitting down to read a good book and hanging out with friends. Insteed of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook, myspace, twitter, youtube, addicting games, and whatever else they could find. I do not agree with that being sluck to the computer like is to chese. No! If there was our thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distracts kids and teenagers from doing other things in life, also it doesn't follow families to be a family. Before computers were made all people bad was their family. Coming home from school saying ""@CAPS3 dad, home from school. What t go play see catch""? Instead of that kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to your facebook message. Computers also cutt off interacting time that families always and to have. @DATE1 @TIME1 instead of talking to @CAPS5 myspace, why don't you grab and plays family board game! Or go out to on restaurant, talk about your next vacation and what you'd be interseted doing go to the same field have a game, or to your local base ball field and play kickball, instead of sitting there mesmerized by the computer screen! Okay, I @MONTH1 understand that some people just @MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise and that is totally understandable that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer and a book. Reading is yet fun but it is also , with out being in school! As you read your brain to inner works, you or your so you can show off to you friends out family on words that you .

"Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of. I hope that my lette and probably many others show you about computers actually do..Slaymaker lock company was a manufacturer of locks founded in 1888, which for a time made steam powered automobiles..Student Information Processing Board (SIPB) is a student group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that helps students access computing resources and use them effectively..The Opel Kadett C is a small family car which was produced by the German automobile manufacturer Opel from 1973 to 1979..Radar.net was similar to other photo sharing websites such as Flickr, but was adapted especially for viewing content created with mobile phones..The Aalto University is a Finnish university established on January 1, 2010, by the merger of the Helsinki University of Technology, the Helsinki School of Economics, and the University of Art and Design Helsinki..The Las Vegas Park Speedway was a horse and automobile racing facility in Las Vegas, Nevada."
"Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from school and go on aim. So they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obiese. I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun. Also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together. The kids will see more nature and be bale to learn more about animals. When kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing. ALso some kids post pictures of themselves on things like facebook that are not appropriate and cna get them in lots of trouble. They also say things that they wouldn't normally say to a persons face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble. Whne your outside palying baseball, football or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and your having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obies. Some say the computer is good hand eye coordination but catching a football or hitting is bettre. Also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends is better than talking in your friends or video chatting with them, @CAPS2 are to many over weight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not heloing the cause. .He served as the Oklahoma Secretary of Science and Technology under Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry, having been appointed by Henry in 2004 and leaving the post in 2011..MartinLogan is an American company producing conventional subwoofer speakers as well as floor-standing, wall-mounted, and in-wall hybrid speakers using electrostatic loudspeaker and planar magnetic thin film loudspeaker technology..Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing, or automobile racing) is a motorsport involving the racing of automobiles for competition..It has Roland's D-Field Controller technology..Colegio de Kidapawan (CdK), formerly North Cotabato Institute of Technology (NORCIT) is a private and a non-sectarian tertiary school located at Quezon Boulevard, Kidapawan City..Leeds College of Technology (formerly Kitson College) was a further education college in Leeds, in West Yorkshire, England."
"Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research. Without computers, kids an adults won't be provided with the necissary tools for knowledge. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home and that @NUM3 person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects. Another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together. Facbook, @CAPS2, and twitter users can chat with people accross the street, accross the country and even accross the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION3! My last reason is that computers are great for buiesnessess. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their buisness is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper. Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but thats them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people! They give us research, they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world..The technology replaces traditional components such as the pumps, hoses, fluids, belts and vacuum servos and master cylinders with electronic sensors and actuators..Collabrification of mobile and web applications allows people to build relationships, increase shared understanding, increase productivity, organize thoughts, and make mobile technology, specifically related to mobile applications, more fun and engaging..Pixellot is a sports technology company which offers machine learning and artificial intelligence-based automatic production solutions for the semi-professionaland amateur sports markets..The card was introduced in 1992 to enhance the technology of the transit system and eliminate the burden of carrying and collecting tokens..He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and Scientific American has recognized him as one of the top 50 leaders in science, technology and business..The societal impact of nanotechnology are the potential benefits and challenges that the introduction of novel nanotechnological devices and materials may hold for society and human interaction."
"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think its a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because it does teach kids something, it good to do homework on and you can relax when your on it. Well computers teaches kids a lof of things like hand-eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it. There is also websites that can show you how to move yor hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the comptuer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dont have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time.

"Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are a great machine to use. People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the great inventions we have. They are very helpul in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. If your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. Also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things. Finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is @CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want your friends you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpul in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends I hope, you see my point at view they are samething everyone should have..It has proprietary verification technology that allows it to verify student status..Future Vision Technologies (FVT), operating from 1991 to 1995, was part of the second wave of companies working to commercialize virtual reality technology..Wahoo Fitness is a fitness technology company based in Atlanta, Georgia..The field is in its infancy and is sometimes known as synthetic biology or bionanotechnology..Shanghai-Branch Information Technology Co., Ltd.

"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 opinion's on what effect's do computer's have on people is without the computer we couldn't research important people and event's. Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that @CAPS1 first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example who is harry @PERSON1. He was the @NUM1 president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them.

"Dear Newspaper, I think computer use is good because, it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. Also people will have the ability to learn about different states and countries. I ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns. Those are all the reasons why I think computers are a good use. The first reason why I think people should use computers is it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. People will know how to stay focussed with their eyes and also know how to also use their hands all at the same time. To stay focussed with their eyes people would have to wear glasses for the light. Also so when they are typing they wont have to keep looking down all the time. When people coordinate with their hands on the computer its so they know were the different are thats why computers are good. My second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries. They can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look. Also they will be able to read about what different cultures they have and religions. In the states also be to read about @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and how we have a wonderful state. That's why computers are good use. My final reason why the use of computers is good because, people can interact with their family and friends online. There are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends. You can talk to each other. Also you can talk to them even if their in a different state. You guys can talk about a lot of different things. For example, the family and life and even if you miss them. Thats why computers are good. Those are my reasons why computers are good. Not only can it teach you about hand-eye coordination, family and friends, and about different states. But also you can play a lot of different games and also type on an notepad. Also if your stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator. That's why people should use the computers..In-car entertainment (ICE), or in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), is a collection of hardware and software in automobiles that provides audio or video entertainment..Free Fall is a 2006 puzzle game released on the Game Boy Advance and mobile phone based on the card game Uno..Elza Erkip is a Turkish-American electrical and computer engineer, professor and wireless technology researcher at New York University..MCC (as it was known) initially featured the Atari 2600, an Equinox 100, 9 Processor Technology Sol 20 computers (S-100 bus systems), the Radio Shack Model I and the Commodore PET..The FPR technology uses the precise film which polirizes different pixels differently (in LG cinema display line of pixels to polirize one way is followed by line to polirize another way) to show a different image for each eye..He has been the Chief Technology Officer of the New York City Department of Transportation since 2008."
"Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet, also you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, webchat and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. You can personally see someone from acroos the @ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and @CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Business also use webchatting, as I previously state, for conference calls. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, connect humans with each from half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. @CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?.A megastructure consisting of multiple layers of shells suspended above each other by orbital rings supported by hypothetical mass stream technology..EMS Healthcare is a supplier of mobile medical equipment based in Ellesmere Port..While the car's advanced design makes it impossible to functionally create with 2015 technology, the company has discussed creating it a few decades in the future, when technology has caught up with the car's design..Hansen Medical, Inc, headquartered in Mountain View, California, designs and manufactures medical robotics for positioning and control of catheter-based technologies that was founded in 2002 by Frederic Moll, M.D. to develop tools that manipulate catheters by combining robotic technology and computerized movement..Diana Elizabeth Forsythe (1947-1997) was a leading researcher in anthropology and a key figure in the field of science and technology studies..Today, many of the largest technology companies in the world are headquartered in the city, including Google, Mozilla Foundation, Symantec, and Intuit."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying "",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!"" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, amking many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see.

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion @CAPS3 as to why some people support advances in technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people is that I disagree. Some people dont even get enough sleep if they stay up too late on computers. Also they spend less time exersizing and less time interacting with family and friends. Thos are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph I am going to tell you about why I think that people should @CAPS4 other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy dont blame them the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer?

In the morning she was soo grumpy because she was soo tired. @CAPS1 languege arts teacher ""@PERSON1"" says that ""@CAPS2 up late on the computer all night isnt healthy because you get bugs under your eyes and youre sleepy.

In this paragraph I am telling you @CAPS1 second reason as @CAPS3 why I disagree which is less time excersizing. (@CAPS3 the parents) @CAPS4 you realy want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all days or @CAPS4 you want your kids to excersize and get healthier? @CAPS1 friends kids always are on the computer everyday all the time and thats not verry healthy @CAPS3 them especialy because they're young. So a couple of weeks ago I talked to them about being active and how its not good to be on the computer alot. Now they bearly go on the computer they always are outside and playing and running around. @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON3 says that ""@CAPS5 excersize is better than doing anything non active also it can be fun. @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. In this paragraph I am going to explain to you why I think interacting with family and friends is better than on the computer. If you were in your familys shoes @CAPS4 you think that they would rather have you come hang out with them or be on the computer? When I was younger @CAPS1 family used to have to yell at me to get me off the computer so I could hang out with them but finaly a day come when I got to understand their family pain. @CAPS1 mom says that ""I should hang out with @CAPS1 family and friends more often."" @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 conclusion I disagree with the statement ""Some people support advances and technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people."" @CAPS1 reason as @CAPS3 why is that people arent @CAPS5 enough sleep, less time excersizing, and less time interacting with friends and family..The company was engaged in the designing and manufacturing of customized connected lifestyle devices and services for mobile network operators and global consumer brands..The Institute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition, Guwahati is an education institution for training students in hotel management, catering technology, general food management, and allied subjects, located in Guwahati, the capital of Assam, India..The MX was the first Meizu phone to achieve extensive coverage on tech blogs and websites outside China because of its features comparable to the flagship phones of major mobile phone manufacturers..MGM Wireless is an ASX listed Australian technology company (ASX:MWR) which provides SMS, mobile communication, app and cloud based technology to schools for communication and student absence management..Since 2013, he has been the editor-in-chief of Environmental Science & Technology Letters, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science..Along with a monthly technology column for The Detroit Jewish News, Miller blogs about the intersection of technology and Judaism for the JewishTechs.com blog, The Huffington Post, Time.com and his own blog, which launched in March 2003."
"Computers, a very much talked about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and ""I.M.'s"", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""world of warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. It is things like this that make life that much easier for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. These are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. I know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. Being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. These are some of the reasons that I and others love computers.

"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are important for growth. They teach us skills like hand-eye coordination, they allow you to talk online, and learn about faraway people and places. I do believe that it benefits society even though many people dont. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine. I know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teamate passes the ball to him and he can't catch it because he has no hand-eye coordination skills. That wouldnt happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, that help build that up. When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination. out of @NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online. Its the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better and they tell you things that they dont want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Lets say you want to know about someone famous, you look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doning anyone good. Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We dont want out society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to furter our education or not?.MIC provides multiple technical services for the metal treatment industry, including Thermal Spray, Solid Film Lubricant and Parylene Coatings, and Materials Testing Services; but is best known for its legacy Shot Peening technology, which can enhance the performance of metal components, preventing premature fatigue and corrosion failures..With hardware is meant the technology itself and with software the skills, knowledge and capacity that accompany the transfer of the technology..The name is an abbreviation of Metagenomic Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology..Troy Wolverton (born June 13, 1971 in San Antonio, Texas) is an American journalist and the personal technology columnist for the San Jose Mercury News..Business informatics (BI) or organizational informatics is a discipline combining information technology (IT), informatics and management concepts..22.2 or Hamasaki 22.2 (named after Kimio Hamasaki, a senior research engineer at NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories in Japan) is the surround sound component of Super Hi-Vision (a new television standard with 16 times the pixel resolution of HDTV)."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, In a pole conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people agreed that computers are a easier way to research than going to a library. Over the @DATE1 few years it has become a growing debate as to wheather computers are a benifit to socity or not. Today in america over @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer, according to the @ORGANIZATION1 are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary. Communication is a vital part @ORGANIZATION1 america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. @CAPS3 computers provide better and faster communication. They are also far more reliable. In the @DATE2's if you wanted to speech with some one who is far away you would have to send a letter.

Through the internet all the information @ORGANIZATION1 the world is available @NUM1./ Computers are also the former in todays technological advances. Computers allow us to have inventions that run there self so human operation is not nessisary. this same technology saves lives every day and alows us to create @ORGANIZATION3 better technology. As you can see computers are the greatest technology created in the @DATE1 and allows faster and more relible communication, is the greatest library the world has ever known, and allows for the creation @ORGANIZATION1 even more advanced technologies.

"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a lot of affects on people. Some affects are it takes away from family and friends, you don't really have a social life and you don't get enough excersise. Computers take away from friends and family time. I did an interview yesterday with @PERSON1; and I asked,"" @CAPS1 you go over your grandmas house what do you usually do?"" @CAPS2 said, ""I usually use the computer."" @CAPS3 do you want to use the computer while your their? your with your family your supposed to spend time with them. Play a game like monopoly, or play @CAPS4. Those are fun and great way to interact with your family. If your family member doesn't have those games bring them! People think that because there is facebook, aim, e-mail, and myspace that your interacting with friends. You really aren't. I asked my friend @PERSON3 what @CAPS2 thought of those things and @CAPS2 said ""They are great interacting websites."" They really aren't. They are websites on the computer. While you are on the computer your not really maintaing a social life. Your town holds activites or has a fun place you could too. Your town @MONTH1 have a gym, community center, or a library. Go their and hangout with friends interact with them. Go to school, goto the library, and hang out with friends are great ways to interact with people.

Sometimes kids dont even like to go do exercises they stay on the computer eating & eating. I think if their was no technology kids these days wont be beast. Some kids dont even like hanging out with their friends or family they say that they want to stay home on the computer but we should do more, exercises than being on the computer. If were always on the computer we wont learn nothing at school because when were at school kids could be thinking about going home to go on the computer and you wont focused on our education @CAPS1. And what if kids drop out or dont come to school anymore because they to be chatting with their friends or a stranger. What if a girl didn't want to go to school and on her computer.

"Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 and I am a @NUM1 year old girl; yet active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity. All of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay. I dont you want a happy and successful life?!

"Dear newspaper, Some people say that computers don't benefit society. But I think diferent. Computers benefit society more than you would think. They help people learn and makes work much easier. They help prevent acidents, and the save lives. Computers help people learn and make work easier its a fact. You can type you can plan your sedual. You can make a presantation or check your email. All of those things make work easier. And there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Makeing work easyer or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computers abilitys. Computers can prevent acidents in anything that moves. For example cars millions on the road today and some can practily drive them selves. And that is all done with computers. Also planes, the only reason the piolot is there is in case something gose wrong. Same thing with trains. Furthermore @CAPS1 are completly computerized all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time. And that makes the world safer for every one. Finaly computers save lives, its completly true. In hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs and asist with surgery. In surgery computers help by only haveing to make a tiny insision and can be much more acurate than human sergons which save lives. Also computers can mak sure that a operating room is completly sterial which reduces risks of infection. As you can see computers benifit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easyer. They prevent acidents with which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go they are almost garenteed a survival.

"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years computers has been a great invention. It helped people learn more information, communicate with people, and @CAPS6 invent more technology. This is a positive effect for our country. let me excplain. Computers is a positive affect for our country because it helps us find information for school and for location were to go. The computer helps me find information for my science project faster than going to the library and looking up information on a book."" @CAPS2 @PERSON1 in @NUM1 grade. In case we get lost on the roads the computer can @CAPS6 us get to out location. Another reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can @CAPS6 us communicate with our friends and family.""@CAPS3 I cant contact my mom I email her on my computer."" @CAPS2 @PERSON2. Also most of kids parents can contact their teacher and email them to see how they are doing. The last reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can @CAPS6 us invent diffrent things. Scientist can easily invent more kinds of technology by using the computers."" The computer has helped us first make a model of our invention then we start making the details."" @CAPS4 @CAPS5. @CAPS1 the years computers helped us with almost everything. Conclusion the computer @CAPS6 us with our search for information, @CAPS6 contact people, and @CAPS6 make new inventions. This has also helped us in wars.

"You've got mail! @CAPS1 my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to! It is evident, that computers are effective, and are advancing technology in our society..SSR is based on the military identification friend or foe (IFF) technology originally developed during World War II, therefore the two systems are still compatible..As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status..SpaceX announced in 2011 that it was beginning a funded reusable launch system technology development program..ASRC Aerospace is the prime contractor for the University-Affiliated Spaceport Technology Development Contract (USTDC) to design ground support equipment and develop new technologies..This is the same practice as Mac Tools, Snap-on, and Matco Tools, who together make up the four major flags of the mobile tool business..He is also known, along with Mario Capecchi and Oliver Smithies, for his work in the development of the knockout mouse and the related technology of gene targeting, a method of using embryonic stem cells to create specific gene modifications in mice."
"Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, @CAPS2 computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real-life. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be playing. a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me "" @CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?"" and i answer ""@CAPS2 i have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3."" @CAPS4, the computer takes time away from nature. People dont acknowledge the beauty of the outdoor. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more than @CAPS2 it helps us to appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet computer take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real-life. Some people dont know how to have a face-to-face conversation, they only know how to communicate by email or @CAPS5. I acknoowledge that getting away from real life can be relaxing but some people dont know which side the stomp goes on a letter. It @MONTH1 old-fashioned, but i believe people put their heart something you can't do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real-life, nature and your hobbies. Plus, you can get arthritis in your hands if you type to much..Prior to focusing on software, Inq released a series of ""social mobiles"" for which they were awarded ""Best Newcomer"" and ""Best Handset"" at the GSMA in 2009.In January 2014 Inq announced that the business was to close down and that the apps they had in market would not be updated after this point..The Guide can also be downloaded as a mobile app..An IMAX theater opened in 2007, and a second exhibit hall focusing on the Titan II ICBM and space technology opened in 2008..Closed cells have found widespread use in the past decade due to the availability of reliable window microfabrication technology..Dr. Ewon Ebin was the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation (he was then replaced by Wilfred Madius Tangau in 2015) and the Member of Parliament for Ranau..The main theater is equipped with 400 seats and uses digital puppetry technology similar to Epcot's voice-directed Turtle Talk with Crush."
"About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature..Today it's a golf course and business park with a strong technology theme among its residents..Transmission (also known for sponsorship reasons as Transmission with T-Mobile) is a British television program broadcast on Channel 4, offering live performances and interviews of famous music artists, that ran for three series between 2006 and 2007..Thus DVD Forum under Pioneer's lead developed a technology known as Layer Jump Recording (LJR), which incrementally record smaller sections of each layer to maintain compatibility with DVD-ROM drives..It also has direct applications, for example in the technology of transistors and semiconductors..A monthly subscription is required, but also includes a mobile application for reviewing collected data and receiving alerts as well as roadside assistance..The SDC technology was developed by Software Technologies, ESRI partner in Russia."

"Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you @MONTH1 not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or laptop is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the @CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a @CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society..Ener1 is a company developing energy storage technology building compact lithium-ion-powered battery solutions for the transportation, utility grid and industrial electronics markets..BPAY is an electronic bill payment system in Australia which enables payments to be made through a financial institution's online, mobile or telephone banking facility to organizations which are registered BPAY billers..To bring its breakthroughs to the marketplace, SRI licenses technology and works with investment and venture capital firms to launch a wide variety of ventures..This case is controlled by the principles governing inventory searches of automobiles and of an arrestee's personal effects, as set forth in South Dakota v.

"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 move to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to..NPR One is a mobile app from NPR (National Public Radio), first launched in July 2014, which aims at making it easier for listeners to stream local NPR stations live, and listen to NPR podcasts by autoplaying content and permitting easy navigation..The year 1976 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below..Gojimo is an education software company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, which produces a self-test exam preparation mobile app for the iPhone, iPad, Android and the web..Insignia sold the product line to FWB Software in October 1999 in order to focus on supplying implementations of Java for the mobile device market..The Intersynx technology platform utilized J2ME and Brew based technology and included products such as RingVault, CellBackup and CellSynx..The Thunderbird had been a full-frame automobile since 1967, prior to that it was a unibody."
"Almost everyone is effected by computers in some sort of way. Some people think computers are bad because some people spend too much time on their computers. The thing is computers help us with our everyday life. If we want to comunicate with people from around the world to send donations to places in need like @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1, we can use computers to do that. We can chang people's lifes in third world countries with the help of computers. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online. Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that the users fault not ours. We should choose how long were using one computers. Many jobs would be impossible with out computers. It's not about overusing them its about. So over all I say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands..The E.212 is a second-generation number plan used in America, extended to include the subscriber's MSIN (Mobile Subscription Identification Number) within the network's customer base..The site offered resources on ten key subjects: benefits, civil rights, community life, education, emergency preparedness, employment, health, housing, technology and transportation..It was unveiled at a Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014..Grove started its operations as an Information Technology wing for Merchem Limited..It is ironic that Kodak, the original patent assignee, did not really participate in the economic juggernaut that it created through this lithographic printing technology..One possible use is in interactive entertainment such as video gaming, where the technology is used to help computer-controlled characters to develop."
"Many people like computer and like to use them for many different kinds of reason. Some people use them to get online education. Other use them to talk to family and friends that are far away. Also student use them to do research for school. These are reason why computer could be a good devices. There are many people that now have the ability to get a online education because of problem that they have. For example people that can't walk and don't like going to regular school. The computer would help them find website that they could get a free education. The computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher. The computer would make it so easy and better for the people that don't have the ability to walk they can even study for test that they have on the computer. This one reason why many people use computer. Many family use computer to try to look for freind that they haven't seen in a long time or family that are far away. They even contact them by chatting threw websites. They also search for addressed and phone number. Many people get to find there family threw internets. They meet in spot are even come to one another hauses. The computer would allow their dreams to happen by finding their familys. This would be an exciting event for them this why they need computer. This is one very important reason student use computer to research projects. Without computer student won't be able to look for information they need to know. The computer would teach student about people in the past they didn't know or didn't got to meet. The computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history. Children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher. These are some reason why I think we all need computer. We need them for people that don't have the ability to walk, for people that have family and friend far away, and for student that would like to learn more. These are all things people enjoy doing on a computer. If there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future. So this are some reason why many people decide to be on computer..Stone is also an undersea technology and exploration specialist, particularly in his use of deep-sea submersibles, and has produced a series of marine conservation films..Programs offered are in the fields of (1) Business, (2) Health Services, (3) Information Technology, (4) Construction and Manufacturing, and (5) Transportation..The Portal games are noted for bringing students and their projects from the DigiPen Institute of Technology into Valve and extending their ideas into the full games..Knowledge-based engineering (KBE) is the application of knowledge-based systems technology to the domain of manufacturing design and production..He has instructed classes on Nature and Technology, Phenomena of Color, Outdoor Studio and Drawing and Painting at the University of New Mexico as well..His initial designs were liquid-cooled inline engines built by the Laurin & Klement Automobile Works of Austria."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have heard that people are thinking of how computers are having a bad effect on people and I disagree. Computers help people so much in schools, work places, and at home. Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers. For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays, letters and so many other writing pieces, and the same goes for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students use computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some @ORGANIZATION1 even more. For example my @CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters. She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can't read it she can't grade it. I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write the things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose, soon hand writing will no longer ne required. Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs, for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could ""take control"" of people and people would spend to much time on them. But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time, keeping computers would benefit in so many ways. Writing many different essays, letters, typing for projects, and doing research would be done faster and easier..It usually operates at sentence-level segments, but some translation technology allows matching at a phrasal level..The I-500 has been known to be the most grueling snowmobile race of all time next to the Iron Dog in Alaska..The Stanford Learning Lab completed its work in the spring of 2002 and was followed by The Stanford Center for Innovations in Learning (SCIL), which inherited core capabilities in technology development, educational program evaluation, and learning design and continued to perform research in these areas..The study was cited by the Federal Highway Administration's Office of Safety in its promotion of a cost-effective technology known as the Safety Edge, one of nine countermeasures FHWA considers proven to reduce motor vehicle crashes and improve safety..Critical Path is a provider of messaging services, working in partnerships with mobile operators, telecommunications companies, ISPs, and enterprises..The Nokia Lumia McLaren is an unreleased smartphone developed by Nokia and Microsoft Mobile that utilized a new technology dubbed ""3D Touch"" (a feature that is unrelated and not the same as the 3D Touch feature that was introduced on the iPhone 6s in late-2015)."
"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers have a posotive effect on people. There is many ways computers can have posotive effects on humans, first computers bring people together and let people interact with each other, They let people talk to each other. Computers also let people learn about new things. The internet has so much information. Computers also let people do things that they can't do with out computers. So computers have a positive effect on people. Computers let people interact with each other. The computers bring people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it. But with email they would get it the second you send it. There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people. When you and you freind cant talk together you just have to get on you computer. Computers also have web camera, those let people talk to echother. and you can see them. It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone thats why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet. If you someone else they might not know the answer. Computer let people see pictures and videos. If you wanted to see a picture of @CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Vidios let you watch things like something funny to cheer up you day. If you love a show on to, and you missed it you can find it on computer. That is why computer benifit people positively. Computers also let you do things that you couldn't do without. When a teacher asks me to type a paper I always do it on the computer. If there were no computers I would have to use a typewriter and if I made a mistake I would have to type the whole thing again. Computers also alow you to play music. On the computer you can put a cd in and it will play the music. Computers alow you to do things that couldnt do without Computers benifit society an have a positive effect on people, They let people interact with each other and they bring people together. They let people talk to each other. Computers also let you learn about newthings. They also let you do things that you couldnt do without. Computers have many positive effects on people so I hope you agree that computers benifit soctity.These advances in the history of technology stimulated societies to adopt new ways of living and governance..She obtained her Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran i, Master of Science from UCLA and MA in statistics and PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from UC Berkeley in December 2005..The initial research into fire appliance visibility was conducted by the Lanchester College of Technology and the Fire Brigade in Coventry, UK in about 1965..The company provides software for online casinos, online poker rooms, online bingo games, online sports betting, scratch games, mobile gaming, live dealer games and fixed-odds arcade games online..The new generation of POI systems will be designed to allow devices other than credit cards to be used to make payments (e.g. mobile phones or PDA's), provided that the same high level of security is ensured by the equipment..Hanwha Q CELLS Co., Ltd. is a manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) solar cells with headquarters in Seoul, South Korea and for technology and innovation in Thalheim, Germany."
"Dear local newspaper I disagree because people should just enjoying spending time with famimely and not on the computer  doing nothing do you agree with me so far? Frist of being if you wast all you're time being of the computer there is nothing there is nothing you can get done as I have notice many shildren are on computer every right after school playing on the computer. For example my cosiun is on the computer evryday doing  but wasting his time are you still with me. Secondly children should be studying on the computer not playing video games and going in website that are not allowed more then @NUM1 do students and children are on the internet palying video games and doing something the is done everyday also I have seen many kids playing games on the computer. Thirdly student will never learn nothing if they wast there time because computer is for studing and many students don't have there time wisely as they should also many student should be useing comput only sometimes not everyday I have notice that so many students don't learn from compu for because they are not studing tests mre then @PERCENT1 stundent fail classes because of computer. First of people should be spending time with  and friends because they are teh most important people aroun ud not computers. Are still with me? Secondly friends are the most important people I ever had because they care about and love you like you're ther families but what if you just wast youre on computer how are you know all your friends. For example m allways on comput never goes to see her friemds amd her friends to to here because she never cares about their only computer do god get what im saying here. Thirdly family is also important then just being on the computer because they care about you have to at lease spend sometime with family for example many families stop spending time with each othe because computer is important to them. Lastly help you're community is goal because you make you\re city look you don't want it he be massy also many people quit help with commicity servic around the neighbor for example I have see  trash on grounds and because they dont care. Finally going out doing sports and starting fit is very important.

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable..Retrocomputing is usually classed as a hobby and recreation rather than a practical application of technology; enthusiasts often collect rare and valuable hardware and software for sentimental reasons..Dalpatpur phones and mobiles can be accessed by adding the Indian country dialing code +91 from abroad..There is a strategic grain silo in Okuku, and the College of Medical Sciences of the Cross River State University of Technology (CRUTECH) is also located there..The Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education (ODCTE, commonly known and branded as CareerTech) is an agency of the state of Oklahoma located in Stillwater, Oklahoma..Visualant, Incorporated develops a spectral matching technology using a patented ChromaID approach..Tel attempted to create a youth-oriented image to sell their mobile phones and One."
"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I, for one do not. I think a decent amount of time on the computer, you can benefit from. But I do belive that computers are a huge part of peoples lives now. I think that people should get off the computer, and get some exercise more and more people would be so much healthier, if they took the time they were on the computer and exercised instead. On the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places, nature, and even people. But if people got off the computers and traveled and enjoyed nature, they would be able to live it, not just see a picture. Everything would be so much more fun if you were there and got to experience it, not just read about it. Another reason why I feel so strongly about people spending less time on computers is because they don't spent much time interacting with family and friends when you are the computer to much it seems like you drift away from you friends and family. Almost as if you are to ""busy"" to see them. So as you can see I highly disagree with the overuse of computers..His 2006 book, Hell and High Water summarized observations and forecasts of climate change, discussed technology and policy solutions, and criticized political disinformation used to undermine climate science..Harry McCracken is technology editor for Fast Company and the founder of Technologizer, a website about personal technology..It was established by the city in 1913 for the maintenance and repair of all municipal automobiles..The show features creative techniques for cooking and the memorable Toastermobile..Odle is a social translation-based mobile app, it was launched at TechCrunch disrupt on London, and operating under Odle IT SDN BHD company based in Kuala Lumpur ..In addition to the mobile game, SYBO Games introduced the Subway Surfers animated series and SUBSURF lifestyle brand."
"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a very positive effect on people. @CAPS13 reasons are that they can educate @CAPS1, they make things easy, they are enjoyable. Below, I will explain each reason. Firstly, its very educational. Computer are like a giant resource of information. Many teachers @MONTH1 direct their students online @CAPS2 learning purposes. Also, alot of people go online to research information @CAPS2 their school, job, or a project. Great websites that are packed with information, like @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed using a computer. @CAPS2 example imagine having to do your research using only books, but you live far @CAPS6 a library. The internet makes that research very easy, as you access to @CAPS7 any time! Secondly, they make things very easy to do. Computer provide people with many easy, convieniant ways to do many tasks. If there werent any computers in the world. don't you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging? Almost all of the @CAPS4/@CAPS5 in the @LOCATION2 like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them In buy things online, which is way more easy than going by car. I remember a time when I wanted to by something @CAPS6 a store all the way in @LOCATION1 I went online at home and bought @CAPS7 there! Also, @CAPS7 makes things like ordering @CAPS8, getting plane tickets, getting help alot much easier & @CAPS7 saves time! Thirdly, computers are very enjoyable! They provide alot of @CAPS17 things to do! @CAPS2 example if you are bored you can get on computer, & search @CAPS2 a game you enjoy. There is always a game you'll like. On of all of that, you enjoy @CAPS7 by talking to your friends and Family. You stay in touch, while enjoying their company. Another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another, lightining @CAPS10 because of email. Imagine that you don't have a phone, and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip, that you son is very sic. If you send @CAPS7 by mail, @CAPS7 take at least @NUM1 days. By email, only a couple minutes so, you can see that computer also can provide some @CAPS11 of safety @CAPS2 everybody! So, as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @CAPS13 ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @CAPS1 learn. They make things like ordering @CAPS8, getting tickets, or contacting helpl very easy @CAPS15, they are very enjoyable, @CAPS6 playing @CAPS17 games, to staying in touch with your Friends and Family. Don't you think that without computers we'd probably suffer? I think computers have a great effect on people.The purpose of this was that the buyer could burn a copy of the album onto the CD-R to give to someone else as a gift, paying homage to the effects of digital technology upon the dissemination and popularization of music..Its primary mission was to provide airmobile reaction forces to aid in the extraction of recon teams and execute immediate exploitation raids on targets discovered by the teams..The station is located near the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology (LUCT)..The pilot is seated in an open framework suspended beneath a fabric-covered wing on which the engine (adapted from a snowmobile) and pusher propeller are also mounted..The firm was created as a spin-off corporation from privacy and anti-spam technology firm ePrivacy Group to bring to market the world's first anti-spam router..As a composer he is known for incorporating electronic technology into his works."
"To: The @ORGANIZATION1 can be a big part mof people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth grade teachers once said, ""@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big french paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!"" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers! .Users' Group of Davis (commonly known as LUGOD) is a users' group of students and faculty from the University of California, Davis, Information technology professionals from the Sacramento region, and hobbyists interested in Linux and free and open-source software..Appy Pie is a mobile app creator released for Android, iOS, Fire OS, and Windows Phone platforms that allows its users to create and monetize different types of mobile apps..Over the course of development, the console technology was down-scaled due to high costs and potential health concerns..The college provides courses in Computer Education & I.T.

"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves '@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!.The blockchain technology popularized by bitcoin is an implementation of a distributed database..It was developed by EA Mobile and Hasbro..The year 1907 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below..Elko was the largest IT and computer technology company in Latvia in 2016..It was an application of Bluetooth communication technology..In economics, market saturation is a situation in which a product has become diffused (distributed) within a market; the actual level of saturation can depend on consumer purchasing power; as well as competition, prices, and technology."
"Most adults beileve that computers are just awaist of time and are somtimes can be addicting or bad for health. Well its true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socilizing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer, and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town. There is another @CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of. People you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing. There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actuall important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy. Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework. Its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school. How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather people always want to know breaking news. Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting. There is one more topic that I know youre going to absoltly love. I mean right now your grading this in your office, well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl. People work from home all the time. you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns company and works from home most days. Its absoutly @CAPS1 be is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying its only a click away here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there, well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple keys and boom, your on your way to see your information. That was faster then two hours i'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future. So the next time you log on to your comptuer do some of these things and turst me your will think exactly what I think..It allows the application of ultrasound technology, such as piezoelectric transducer or CMUT, to see from inside blood vessels out through the surrounding blood column, visualizing the endothelium (inner wall) of blood vessels in living individuals..The Metzger House is a historic residence in Mobile, Alabama, United States..Advance nuclear medicine and knowledge, Develop better materials for widespread applications (energy, health, environment, manufacturing, etc.), Improve safety and other engineering of nuclear energy systems, and Managing the risks and benefits of nuclear technology for society and our environment..The year 1937 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below..They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made up of a large number of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements..IPBC was invented in the 1970s and has a long history of effective use as an antifungal technology."
"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exersize any more because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family.

"Dear newspaper, People are spending to much time on their computers. They are on the computers when they should be exercising. People need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends. Let me explain more. Firstly, the people who are consently @CAPS1 people, facebooking people, or on myspace aren't getting exercise. Now, more than ever people are becoming very obese. It is very unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and becoming overweight. Eight out of ten @CAPS2 aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers, they don't sit back, relay and take in nature. People don't get that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinced they are not comming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone. Computers are the wall between inside and going outside in back at the world. Finaly, the computers are getting in the way of seeing family and friends. Everyone is so caught up in the newist computer they don't see their friends or family I know some people who when its time for dinner, they walk down to the kitchen. Get their food and bring if to their computer so they don't miss out on anthing family and friends are very important. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 onley see friends and family on holidays. Computers are getting in the way of everything! People arent getting the exercise they need. They aren't going outside to enjoy the nature and the arent seeing there friends and family. We need to get people off their butts and away from the computer. Why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway?.RAID technology allows for multiple devices to be accessed simultaneously where the data is spread across the devices..He has also written books on PHP and Web technology..In mobile environments, augmented learning has also been deployed on tablets and smartphones..A typical issue includes sections for world and national news, op-eds, sports, entertainment, business, arts and culture, travel, health and automobiles..Anvita Health, founded in 2000 and formerly known as SafeMed, was a healthcare analytics company located in San Diego, California, that served doctors, health managers, disease management companies, point-of-care information technology (IT) systems, personal health record (PHR) providers and other clinical providers to help prevent avoidable medical errors..Associated technology used in mobile computers with external graphics cards, such as in laptops or notebooks, is called AMD Hybrid Graphics."
"Dear @CAPS1, In my opinion I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people @MONTH1 have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer. For example, @CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what. Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. When I say this I mean like @CAPS2 you have a computer connect with them on the computer. For example like @CAPS2 you have a gmail, facebook, yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there. I do it all the time. Last reason why I that we should use computer is because sometimes @MONTH1 have to go on the for example @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 had important message the website and you message you. I do it why can't you. So yes I do their..The Science and Technology Academy focuses on elective courses that integrate Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics..Kharge holds the Information Technology and Bio-Technology, Science and Technology Department portfolio in the Government of Karnataka..The MIT Center for International Studies (CIS) is an academic research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology..M.

"Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people..Gerber was selected in 2015 to succeed Robert McGrath as permanent director of GTRI and replaced Stephen E.

"I think computers work @CAPS4 because it helps people with there own work. but computers do make people addicted because you mostly could do anything but mostly computers were able to use for help like work, maps, friend to find ot problems like for school it helps htem with math, science, social studies and @CAPS4 of more things. But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people. And computers do really break @CAPS4 because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. So you mostly spend about @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ as fix it. And there new computers come and its like @NUM3$ and @NUM4$ and there different just from beand and ther go aboutmore faster. And whne people's computer break some go crazy and feel like doing some cordy stuff. Ther does feel like they does friends they only stay at the room for every they never down out at all and if they do come out the room they instly dont respect there parents they do whatever they feel like doing and they they act into troubles with the .

They teach hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure bull !@. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people!

There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em?

Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With there everday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact.

"Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8? Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it neccessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at to go industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculatir or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example @MONTH1 need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead @ORGANIZATION1 a book with a few authors."" @CAPS7 day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest @ORGANIZATION1 his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got a half @ORGANIZATION1 a page @ORGANIZATION1 notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the @ORGANIZATION2 computer and got three pages @ORGANIZATION1 notes. ""I was so releived to log on to the internet"", @PERSON1 reported to me. A survey was set up by the @CAPS8 foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and @PERCENT3 said yes. Do you want students @ORGANIZATION1 all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine @ORGANIZATION1 modern day technology.

"Dear @CAPS1, The effects computers hace on society is a mixture of positive use and negative use. Getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer. When you are on the computer. When you are on the computer for more than @NUM1 minutes ayou start to get lazy and not wanting to get up. That affects a lot of people @DATE1 because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer. Kids are harder because they don't want to do something other than just sitting on the computer instead of when they come back from school because they are so tired, if we limit the time they use the computer it will be better for kids, grown ups, and your brain. When adults spend a lot of time on the computer due to there jobs or checking their email, a lot of times they don't interact with their family or other people because they are on the computer I can connect with this because @CAPS4 dad is always on the computer due to his office not talking to us or even seeing is. Sometimes I wish that the world should of never invented computers because I get so frustated with them, but a lot of times we do spend family time and its good to get away from your computers beside thats what makes the money. Emailing, chating, @CAPS3, aim, @CAPS2 are all echnology communication using these communcation is helpful if somebody can't text or doesn't have a phone you can always chat them on @CAPS3 or send them an email. Email & @CAPS3 are the only @NUM2 communications I @CAPS4 dad sends use a lot of emails to @CAPS4 soccer coach about how I am not going to be at a game or I am going to a game, and he always responds. It is very easy. @CAPS3 is a good way for kids to talk to one another because some might not have phones or you don't see them at all during the school day. It's a good way to communicate without @CAPS3 or email I don't know what would happen, but I knoe it would be bad. So you see how computers have positives or negatives getting lazy, not spending enough time with friends or family and talking to friends are all positive & negative conflicts of the computer..The company developed a digital signature system based on blockchain technology..Michael Arthur Sayman of Peruvian mother and Bolivian father is a mobile application entrepreneur and software engineer..The journal was edited for 26 years (1987-2012) by Sharon Poggenpohl of the Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Design, with administrative offices at the Rhode Island School of Design..David Sprowle (born 1811) was an orderly sergeant serving in the United States Marine Corps during the American Civil War who received the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Battle of Mobile Bay..Information technology architecture is the process of development of methodical information technology specifications, models and guidelines, using a variety of Information Technology notations, for example UML, within a coherent Information Technology architecture framework, following formal and informal Information Technology solution, enterprise, and infrastructure architecture processes..Currently he is Scientific Director at the 3TU.Centre for Ethics and Technology and editor in chief of Ethics and Information Technology."
"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. For I myself, that I. The internet is a quick way to get the reseach. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. Final grade @CAPS2 I did not type it, on a computer. Typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster.

"Dear, local newpaper @CAPS1 it's true technology is blinding everyone. More and more people are being sucked into electronics and less people are caring about our planet. Their are so many great things out there that could be put at risk. People @MONTH1 say that if you spend allot of time on the computer they would be able to find cure's for the deseases out there. Those are just lies to stay lasy and waste their life on the computer. What is going to happen to all of the sports in the world. The players are going to get old and they will retire and if no one is going to take their place then the games would be cancled. I am a big fan of football and I don't want to see it ge cancled. Some of my friends are saying they are addicted to the computer and I always hope they get out of that habit because what's going to happen when they get older they are going to need a @CAPS2. If they stay addicted they won't want a @CAPS2 and they what they won't have money, they can't pay bills, and they would lose their house. Why do people say they could find cures for things by looking on the computer we all know that's not true. They need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer. They @MONTH1 not want to but they would have to look in books and do some heavey thinking before they can find the cures. I hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad. If we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet @CAPS3 will stay around longer and we could make the a better place..Analog switches are available in both through-hole technology or by surface-mount technology packages..With the use of modern technology such as the printing press and the highly mechanized harvesting of wood, disposable paper became a relatively cheap commodity, which led to a high level of consumption and waste..Samuel Blakeslee (born June 25, 1955) is the founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Technology & Public Policy at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo..A car seat is the seat used in automobiles..Bombus-NG is a native Windows Mobile XMPP client, which doesn't require the installation of .NET Framework runtime..Urban Airship is an American company that provides a mobile engagement platform and digital wallet solution."
"Dear newspaper editor, I think computer are a benefit to everyone. My first reason why I think computers are abenefit is because if you don't know about somthing and you wana learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some research on it. The best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away. The internet has imformation on anything and every thing. my second reason why, is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want. Its not just webcam either you can also go on facebook and other sites like that to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another. my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. Their software on them to write, do projects, and plan things oct. plus most of the modern day society uses computers for stores and business's to keep track of things. Well thats why I think computers benefit us. I told you why I thought they did and how..NBSS offers nine full-time programs, including bookbinding, cabinet and furniture making, carpentry, jewelry making and repair, locksmithing and security technology, piano technology: basic, piano technology: advanced, preservation carpentry, and violin making and repair, as well as a range of short courses and continuing education opportunities..This includes fixed telephony, satellite communications, mobile telephony (in partnership with Al Madar and Libyana Mobile Phone) and other Libyan internet service providers..Howard High School of Technology is a vocational-technical high school in Wilmington, Delaware and is the oldest of four high schools within the New Castle County Vocational-Technical School District, which includes Delcastle Technical High School in Newport, Hodgson Vo-Tech High School in Glasgow, and St. Georges Technical High School in St. Georges..The Hill & Stanier was an English automobile, a six-horsepower cyclecar with a V twin, air-cooled engine..Professor Dhande was the founder director of PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing Jabalpur..Immortalized cell lines have also found uses in biotechnology."
"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on computers @MONTH1 be the same as others or different. I believe that computers help our society. They give us more knowledge on whatever subject we want, it helps us connect to family far away places and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? @CAPS1 cousin lives in @LOCATION2 and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer. What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? In you get exercise and can expose the scenery. With a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep. Say your just a young kid and you're always located to see @LOCATION1 but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years. How would you learn more about them if they're gone? A computer has information about anyone you chance. You @MONTH1 not be exercising but you're expanding your knowledge aren't you. Yes you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person. However, what if the book doesn't have the information you are looking for? You could end up reading for hours when the certain information you want wasn't even there. A computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds. Why waste your time? Now is the time where our technology advances. Why waste your time on something when you've got what you need right at your fingertips? So what are you waiting for? Go learn what you want right now! Haven't seen your cousin in a long time? Start up your computer and get talking. The time is now!.Online applications have their own benefits: In 2009 Showtime launched a password-protected site that allowed voters to download streaming video of ""For Your Consideration"" programming to mobile devices..They are maintained and rung regularly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Guild of Bellringers..Simplex is an automobile manufacturer that existed briefly, in France, between 1919 and 1921..Tatango is a U.S. mobile marketing company that specializes in text message marketing (SMS/MMS) services for enterprise type clients..The trust started using the Carenotes Electronic Patient Record system which can be accessed from mobile devices in September 2015..NM DoIT was created in 2007 to provide state government a strong technical foundation to serve citizens and to create accountability and efficiency in the information technology arena."
"Dear Local newpaper editor, I think computers benefits us in a good way. Weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. Computers are now a benificial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world. And learn about new things everyday. What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that. It's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. It could be online chatting and even sharing photos. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. If people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. And if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. And if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already I can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read I gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. And how I think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them..In 2012 he established the UCT-Samsung Mobile Innovation Lab at the University of Cape Town..The Samsung SGH-U600 is a mobile phone manufactured in Korea by Samsung and is part of the Ultra Edition II series of Samsung phones..HNA Technology Investments Holdings Limited formerly known as Advanced Card Systems Holdings Limited is a Cayman Islands-incorporated offshore holding company..It has a website that is continuously updated with breaking stories, and readers receive regular email or mobile updates on the latest covered bond market news..Wecht originally worked as a theoretical physicist, and notably held research positions at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of Michigan, and the Queen Mary University of London..The company operates commercial radio networks in metropolitan and regional areas of Australia, a pay television station and mobile brands."
"Dear Readers' @ORGANIZATION1 the Local Newspaper, I am almost certain you interact daily with computer. You use computers to write, play games, look at pictures, and print work out. There are dozens @ORGANIZATION1 practical for computers but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage @ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity, expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time. Readers, hear my arguement and by the end @ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise nore or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also plenty @ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"". But do all these & exercise plans really work? According to a study done by the @ORGANIZATION1, the largest cause @ORGANIZATION1 obesity is actually computers! The students at @LOCATION1 had one group @ORGANIZATION1 people try a regular commercial diet plan & another group @ORGANIZATION1 people do exactly what they've been doing... Except their computers. They found that the group who from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 them computer. A familier day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use computer eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. Unfotunately, these happens @NUM1 days a week & the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time. Readers please, try avoiding you computers for just one week, and you can forget those jet plane. Another negative @ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack @ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage. Teens become in their society lives and become to their computers. What they don't notize is that they're totally forgetting about their families! I know I've made the mistake @ORGANIZATION1 becoming too attached to socia networking to remember my family but luckily I have a stable family environment. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships, don't let that happen to you. Your children are without a doubt, through, the ones a by this technical revolution the most. From the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though. Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to profamily, & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sides"". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's & emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without-even knowing. An enormous part @ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ORGANIZATION1 a young age. Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ORGANIZATION1 computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives. @CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @CAPS6? Faced with the concerns @ORGANIZATION1 lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise, separation @ORGANIZATION1 families & mappriate natural children do you really want your children, or even you for that matter, using a computer daily. Think a head @NUM4 years from @CAPS6. Will you say ""I wish I used my computer"" or ""I wish I spent more time"". In the end, the choice is really up to you..Switzerland was featured in the Technology section of an issue of New Scientist in August 2008..Thomas-Detroit was an automobile manufactured by the E.R.

"Dear, local Newspaper, I hear that you think computers have an effect on people. Will I disagree with what you say. I think computer will help us learn, and do things faster. Haveing computers helps the community learn more. My first, reason I think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs. With the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of @LOCATION1 where they type every day and work hard. They also learn more and more facts about the sociatis. Without knowing how to type you @MONTH1 not get any top class jobs. My second, reason telling us that computers are helpful is that it helps your children do better in school by learning how to type for high school, and learning math, sce, social studies and language arts. Computers also helps kids at young age do math and other with their character, like dora, @ORGANIZATION1, elmo, and others. So learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time. Which i know your parents would like. Even new born babys can learn how to read, write and do math and grow up and can be president one day. My third, reason is that it helps send things all over the world. Without computers we would have to do it old fashion style. Also with computers you can talk to family member that live far away from you (In state or country) and you have not see them in a long time. Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day. You can also buy thing off the computer. In my conclution I told you that computers can not effect people by telling you that your child can do better learning and parents also. I also add that it helps you get jobs and help you with your hand and eye cordination in school and out. So computer help the community..The Highway can also be streamed at SiriusXM.com and through its app for mobile devices..ICEGOV has also established itself as a conference attended by all stakeholders of technology-enabled transformation in government..He served as an Assistant U.S. attorney with the United States Department of Justice and advised the US Attorney General on technology policy issues..Mobile Downtown AirportBrookley Air Force Base is a former United States Air Force base located in Mobile, Alabama..Calls and SMS to landline telephones and mobile phones use virtual credits that are earned for free through participating in promotional activities and using the app..The video games have had high sales, with the series as a whole selling over 41 million units by the end of 2017.In addition to the four games of the main series, published for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, the Uncharted video game series includes a browser game, two handheld games, and a mobile game, with varying gameplay styles."
"Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways or doing things for other people, and people have to manage alot of there money and hills on the computer. First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons..The other two cellular operators launch a PTT service similar in function to the one offered by Bravo through its digital trunking network, but the former companies used a technology called PoC for this service..A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a computing device small enough to hold and operate in the hand..Other important cities include Turin, which used to be the capital of Italy, and is now one of the world's great centers of automobile engineering..The advisory functions of the CST had previously been performed by the Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development (ACARD), from 1976 to 1987, and the Advisory Council on Science and Technology (ACOST) from 1987 to 1993..It indicates that consumers will use products that are good enough for their requirements, despite the availability of more advanced technology..Its innovative program integrates the use of technology in the development and implementation of personalized curriculum and learning as well as the use of technology in the learning environment."
"@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the world say that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about forgien people and places and also learn about where your family came from. So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. Another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? Well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. For example, @LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family. I hope you understand this better..The college currently offers Information technology, Management and Social Work courses at the Bachelor's levels..He is known for his work on Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), multi-code CDMA, and smart MIMO antenna technology all while at Bell Labs..He holds 14 patents in the consumer sector which vary from fiber optics to strollers, and has pioneered significant safety contributions to burn-prevention technology..According to Google Scholar, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies belongs to the top-10 journals in educational technology..The platform can be accessed through Vuclip's Android apps as well as through its mobile website [m.vuclip.com]..Noise pollution comes mainly from motorcycle and automobile traffic."
"Typing and surfing the web @MONTH1 be exciting; however, is it worth the @CAPS1 risks that there are now? Before computers were discovered, human's healthyness is triple than what it is now. Computers can be useful and @MONTH1 have some benefits; on the other hand, they are harmful and they should not be used as often. They have unprofessional websites, they are not helpful when it comes to excercise, and they disturb @CAPS1 individuals privacy. @CAPS1 kids are let onto computers every day and they wonder @ORGANIZATION1 to the websites that the internet has to offer. Consequently, kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on. In fact, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 kids enter unproffesional websites and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 them have no parental vision in the @LOCATION1 alone. Therefore, @CAPS1 kids act up in homes and at school. However kids are not the only ones who are affeted by this. Computers have a disadvantage @ORGANIZATION1 being hacked or virused from uncensored websites. MOreover, computers crash or don't allow use @ORGANIZATION1 computer documents because @ORGANIZATION1 these viruses. Ever since the @ORGANIZATION2 was invented obesity and lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise in a person's schedule has skyrocketed. A scientist, named @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1, said,""@CAPS1 computers users have lost their use if muscles, but they have gained to over @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fat causing a lot @ORGANIZATION1 hem to not be able to do activities they did before."" I believe that this is definitely true because I remember that the same happened to my sister. She ate more and her excercise time was spent more on the computer that on her body. I know that @CAPS1 say that computers help in hand-eye coordination, however, is it really worth more than someones healthy body? @CAPS1 things are sold on the internet that are not in stores, but you don't trust the internet when buying these products.

"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be..In automobile and aircraft engineering a fuel gage or gas gage is an instrument used to indicate the amount of fuel in a fuel tank..The North American Light and Power Company was a utility holding company formed in South Bend, Indiana and run since 1916 by its President, Clement Studebaker, Jr., of the family famous for the Studebaker automobiles..It interacts over Bluetooth wireless technology and unlike its wired version, it has no USB connectors or ports..It is the home of the University of Miami Leonard M.

"Dear newspaper, Computers are everywhere in our nation. We have them at home, at @ORGANIZATION1 or at our work. Many people believe that computers are bad for our health or we don’t spend enough time with our family. But I disagree. Computers teach hand-eye coordination let us learn about faraway places, and also let us allow to chat online with other people. Have you ever had trouble with hand-eye coordination? Sometimes mine is ridiculous! But when i get on a computer it gets to be much better. Experts say that @PERCENT1 more people with hand-eye coordination have improved by working with computer. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS1 students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand-eye coordination already."" I agree with these experts too. So many people nowadays that have a computer have passed their hand-eye coordination test! When I grow up and soon get out of high @ORGANIZATION1 I want to travel all over the world. But first I want to be educated on where I go. That is why computers are so helpful. I can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where I can learn all about the places I want to visit. @CAPS2 time @CAPS1 parents told me we were going to @LOCATION1 for the day. So the night before I did a bunch of research of different shops, museums, and places to eat. The computer helped me so much that if we didn't have @CAPS2 then i don't know where would go. President @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS2 time when i had a big meeting in @LOCATION3 I had no knowledge about it. So I logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture, language, and much more. I dont know what I would do if I didn't have a computer."" I love talking to @CAPS1 friends. But once I'm home none of @CAPS1 friends are around me, so I have nobody to talk to. If I also don't have the phone available then that makes it even worse.But, if I go on the computer then I can talk to bunch of @CAPS1 friends. I can go onto @CAPS1 webcam to see who I am talking to or I can go onto another website to get an instant message. I love talking online because ont of @CAPS1 best friends in the whole word moved down to @LOCATION2 so I don't get to talk to her too much. But if I go to the instant message website then I can talk to her as much as I want. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people sold in a survey that they have someone they talk to over the internet. So I say the computer is important in our society. It helps complete a number of tasks. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and it even allows people to talk to friends and family online. So I dont think computers are bad fo us or our health. I think they are important and needed..Block Error Rate (BLER) is used in LTE/4G technology to determine the in-sync or out-of-sync indication during radio link monitoring (RLM)..Hence a set of alumni and beneficiaries of Jesuit institutions have assembled together and registered the Loyola Educational Trust and establishing the Loyola Institute of Technology and Science with the AICTE approval in May 2008..For the director Michael Keusch, a graduate of the film program at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, the film was a chance to revisit the province he grew up in..Dreijer's vocal style is notable for both shrill and deep tones, and also the use of multitracked vocals, with different uses of pitch-shifting technology on each track, creating an intricate and mysterious effect..Isentia is a media intelligence and data technology company headquartered in Sydney Australia, with locations in New Zealand, South-East Asia and Greater China..In early 2016, mi-Fone partnered with Konga.com, a Nigerian online shopping franchise, to sell the mi-Tribe series of mobile devices."
"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives.

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that the computer is good for the society because, @CAPS2 and student's do most of the studies online. We spend most of our time with our family and friends so we want a little bit of time to ourselves. We learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of facts. After reading this essay I hope you will agree with my position. @CAPS2 student's put most of their notes on a laptop and study what they did in class on the computer. @CAPS6 they need to look something for history class they have internet. High @CAPS3 @CAPS4 don't like going to the library so they go on the internet as there source. So @CAPS6 a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat the computer will write the project neatly. The computer/internet has became a big source of learning to our society don't you agree? Our time most of the time is spent with our families @CAPS7 not our friends came over. Go outside and play with them, sit down and play games. Our families we are so little bit of time to ourselves computer won't hurt nobody. We don't on forever we friends or search something useful @CAPS5 we talked to our families @CAPS6 we go online searching for they couldn't fire. People countries to see @CAPS7 enough to visit for @CAPS7 they wanna that country they need a resource that is up to date. A computer is constantly updated with new fact's about everything. I hope after reading this you will agree with my position. Mostly every person has a computer and it does not effect there lives a lot. A computer is a great resource for the public. People wanna meet new people so they use a computer to do so student's want a great grade on those project so they wanna present it nicely.

"Computers are not having a negative affect on society. In fac when you talk with someone online @CAPS1 helps build relationship within that person. A use for computer that is also use full is hand eye coordination. Education is also a useful thing you can use with computers. You can learn about faraway places and monuments. The myth is that computers ruin relationship between friends and family however, In some ways @CAPS1 improves them, when you go on skype you talk with some one online. By doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person. This information proves that computers can actually suport replationships. Hand eye coordination is also something useful that a computer an teach when you type on keyboard your fingers inprove on reflectsel. If you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve. Some people might say that a computer won't help you much @CAPS1 really is possitive to use @CAPS1. A computer is more educational than what most people would think. On certain websites you can see something that can teach you. If you go on a historian websites that someone could learn about different typs of people. Lots of critics say that a computer is not educational. However when you look at the facts a computer can teach a lot. @CAPS1 is easy to belive a computer is not a good thing. But when someone looks at the facts A computer is a great thing to own. If critics acna take these facts into consideration a computer is a better object than what most people say..It is equipped with 650 static S-75 Dvina, S-125 Neva/Pechora and S-200 launchers, 200 mobile 2K12 Kub and Buk launchers and over 4,000 anti-aircraft guns ranging from 23mm to 100mm in caliber..Not only does NTI supply the people, but the call center technology as well..The incident was the deadliest workplace shooting in the United States since December 2000, when Michael McDermott killed seven co-workers at Edgewater Technology in Wakefield, Massachusetts..Camurus AB (publ) is a Swedish research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology company specializing in the commercialization of medicines for treating serious and chronic diseases..Arthur Howland Young (December 19, 1882 - March 4, 1964) was an American engineer, vice president of U.S. Steel, lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and the California Institute of Technology, pioneer of management-labor relations, and recipient of the Henry Laurence Gantt Medal in 1933..In 1990, the college was transferred to its new building, the INTELLECT (Information Technology Lecture) Building, which was eventually renamed as the Gokongwei Building."
"Computers are something everyone uses but there is a time when you get off and start expericing life. Computers do teach hand-eye cordination, let you talk to friends and family, and give you the chance to learn about faraway places and people. But it alos causes people to spend more time of the computer and less time exrcising enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Excercise is a big thing in peoples life. It people, in shape and healthy @PERCENT1 of obeseity is caused by of the computers. Staying on all day sitting down rating. I think these should be a limit on a computer so people spend less time on the computer and more exercising. Most people dont know what it does to them but  time they get unhealthier and weaker. They dont know that sitting down for hars and hars eating a bag a chips does time. Once they start doing it, it because a habit and eating and just go on the computer for hars and hars. Not only does it decrease the time peole spend exercising it also decreases the time people spend enjoying and the Computers are addicting you go on for five minutes and you forget all what you do before you know it you have @CAPS1 hours.

"What if you're family all and to talk to them percent of people commucate online, and thats not a bad thing. Heres the thing, are you for or against kids/parents online for too long. I am all for this. Reasons being are lots of kids have friends that they talk to online, secondly kids have homework/projects that they might have to look up online, and my last reason for this is, some family might have @CAPS1 ect, so they can communicate online. My first reason for this is, a lot of kids have friends online that can't text or even talk on the phone, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now. ""I think the internet is a great things, I mean I would rather have my kids online than outside roaring the and getting into troupe."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1. @NUM1 of @NUM2 kids are online communicating with others. Without a doubt, kids bring home projects and homework everyday right? Wouldn't you rather your kid looking up information online, then have them guessing and getting it wrong? I know that alot of children don't have computers, internet or essy, or maybe their got allowed online. That's why they. I remember the times when I had a project due at school, and I guessed on. that didn't do my grade any good. So then I decided the next time I have a project to do it on the internet. And it worked, I got a much better grade then I did on the one I guessed on. Lastly, mostly everybody has on the internet and would live to and with them while. So even stay online too often your not on it for a bad reason, your on to talk to your family."" @CAPS3 I got internet in my house, I barly ever got to talk to my family. But just then, my son me to get one, and I have the chance to talk to my family everyday. @CAPS2 a recent of a computer. Some people do say on the computer for too long at times, and don't get out on exercise the amount a humane should. or they don't get out of the house as much as they used to @CAPS3 they got the internet. Yes but, it's a good cause, it's not like because forever. Also it's being used for good. Not for anything bad. I think the internet is a great thing, and it puts a effect on many people. Reasons are, kids have friends online to talk too, ""lots of that needs internet, and last of people have family online to talk to so it's now or get out there and your best pick.

"With the click of a mouse, you can access the internet. Computers and internet are a recent innovation. You could probably find one in a common household. They've improved and gotten popular within the last twenty years. I believe they greatly benefit society. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate. Think about how life would be in the @DATE1 without computers. Different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources; such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. The computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it. It's as easy as that. Another benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to @LOCATION1 due to jobs. Thanks to internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them. Im sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messanger, or facebook, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convienent than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you. If we didn't have this connection with forgein countries, everyone’s lives would be different. Computers haven't just changed personal lives. They change the medical field too. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures. Computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis. This saves the lives of many people. @PERCENT1 of tests that have taken place to research a dicsease use a computer of some sort to break it down.

"I use computer all the time and im healthy. Just because you use a computer more than getting exercise dosn’t mean your not healthy. I think computers help a lot in life. Now I will talk about some of the things that computers help out with in life. Computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to no. It will even help you, if you have a job and don't no what time to goin for waste. Computers are also fun. You go to different and play any games. You can also talk to people on them.

"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think people need to see the realatey from computer's and the real world, they're a lot of people spending to much time on the computer and not spending enough time with there familys or doing things that are really important. While your on the computer your not getting any exsercise your not getting stronger your just sitting down. Thats one of the ways people get fat because there not moveing around just sitting down. When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on. I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter!

"There has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society. I personnaly agree with th statement that computers benefit in society. I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her year of practice, she becamr very computer coordinated. My hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand-eye coordination practice ever."" @CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer, people can look up information on countries for pleasure too. Mu mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schoold too. My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states. Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back. I remeber I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically.

"Technology is advancing every day. One main technilogical device that is popular is the computer. More and more people are using them, however, not everyone agrees that it benifits society. I believe that it does benifit us. One reason is that you can explore things at home. Before computers you would have to go to the library, find the book you need, and then search through it until you found the information you needed. Those things alone could take hours, especially if you don't live near on library. However, with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what your looking for. That could save you gas money because you don't have to drive anywhere. Another reason is that you can communicate online for free. Without a computer you would either have to go see that person by driving, talking on the phone, or texting, wich are all expensive. On the computer you have e-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many more. All of them you can communicate in different ways. If you want to look at pictures, take quizes, play games, or talk, thats @CAPS2.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, i do not believe that computers benefit society, I feel this way because I have heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time doing unproductive things. The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising. Now, lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends. Computers are very addicting, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them, though I can understand why certain individuals do it I dont think its right. I have many friends who would rather be on facebook or myspace than hang out with me. The web site listed above can really make you forget about reality. My friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day. The reasons listed above tell you why I believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose. Now, lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users. i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it. So when I read about people wasting time on the computer all day I, myself, was very upset! Statistics show that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours a day on average on the internet, statistics also show that the average aldut spends about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours on the computer a day on average. When I read the above statistics I came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing. Now, lets talk about exercising a bit more. I, myself, know that too much time is being spent on computers. By me knowing that I am aware of the fact that children are not exercising. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need it can cause health problems in the future,.

"Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that nature is better than spending way too much time in the computer? Well, generally speaking, I think it is and i'll give you only three reasons why. First of all, it's about the obesity percentage in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend a lot more time with your family. Finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer. Also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 are obese or overweighted. Last year in @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. Wow, the rate went went up like @PERCENT3 in each year. This info was online at www.tomatotalks.org. Another thing I would like to consider, spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing. All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere especially at the dinner table is a great way to talk about your child's problem's in school, and also to learn their parent's mistakes too. Also share great laugh's. Finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future. Last, but not least, you can enjoy the greater outdoors, and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about. Also trees that gives us oxygen too. Mother nature has it's great benefits when your career is all about science.

"Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are good. You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me.

"Dear, To who it @MONTH1 concer, I am writing this to inform about how the ocmputers benefits society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use @CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or @CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People sue @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they @MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people @MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them..Andrea Neto from the TU Delft- Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016 for contributions to dielectric lens antennas and wideband arrays..Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment (ODME) is a technology that has greatly helped improve efficiency and environmental protection in these areas..A different group called the Automobile Manufacturers' Association was active in the very early 1900s, but then dissolved..Developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, Omeka was awarded a technology collaboration award by the Andrew Mellon Foundation and is used to teach curation..Its campus houses several hospitals and institutions in addition to Medical College Hospital (MCH), including the Colleges of Nursing and Pharmaceutical sciences, the Regional Cancer Center, Thiruvananthapuram Dental College, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, the Priyadarshini Institute of Paramedical Sciences and the Sree Avittom Thirunal Hospital for Women and Children (SAT Hospital)..His research interests include Wearable Computing, Mobile Application Development, Human Centered Design, Computer Vision, AI and Cognitive Science."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that people are spending to much time on computers, and I agree because people spend so much time on computers that @CAPS2 gets addicting, people don’t get enough exersize, and eyesite gots worse. So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of the computer.

Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer just to chek @CAPS3 and facebook like I do but I just check my facebook and the go play basket ball.

"My opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. People ignore their parents when on computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. If they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back. Now for my third reason. Third, People wont enjoy hanging out with there friends.

"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where no information could be saved for the whole world to observe a place with no communication with loved ones or friends; or a life with no possible way of learning of catastrophe's on the other end of the earth. Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education, and stay in contact with friends and family I'm sure our world greatly benifits from this mericle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what thier astronauts saw. But computers made the expirience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered recieving some of the first footage of he moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video are released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees.

We will always be in contact with the ones we love. @PERSON2, my friend, found out her aunt diagnosed last year with cancer. However, she was in a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing and @CAPS7.

"I believe that computers are a great help to society I believe this @CAPS3 when you don'@CAPS1 know something you could go on-line to look it up. Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer. My first reason was that if you don'@CAPS1 know something you could look it up. A lot of times you could be watching @CAPS1.V. or talking with someone and you @CAPS4 wonder what something is or means. @CAPS6 instead of just letting whatever you didn'@CAPS1 know just pass on you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others to. My next reason was that if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have the time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to you door. This is a great help to the people who are to sick @CAPS3 sometimes they are @CAPS6 said they can'@CAPS1 leace there home @CAPS6 instead of starving to death they can have food or anything @CAPS7 to them if they just click a couple of buttons on the computer. Now, also this could help the people who are to busy to go to stores @CAPS3 right before they leave they could press some buttons and when they get home there stuff on sitting there for you.

They had to have this happen @CAPS3 they @CAPS4 worked long hours and they didn'@CAPS1 have the time to go to a grocery @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they had the food @CAPS7 to our house which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green right, @CAPS6 instead of cutting down more trees we can just have all that on our computer which doesn'@CAPS1 we any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society.

"The use of computers is great for everyone. Using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world. Also you can have the ability to talk to people. With a computer you can also learn about places all over the @LOCATION1 and the world. With a computer everyone can learn about people all over. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere in @LOCATION2 you could learn about what those people do. Also you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1 the computer would help a lot. You can search what thet wear and what holdays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends to. if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it.

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know a lot of people now a days are constintly on the computer, and many people think it’s a problem. Well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such @CAPS1 learning, entertainment, and even weight. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do.

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you see, owning a computer can effect you. Having a computer can make you have lazy behavier, can @CAPS2 you from being indoors, and can @CAPS2 you inside so you dont hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. When your lazy or becoming lazy you dont want to do anything, and without doing anything you can become overweight. So, you need exersize because it's good for you and exersizing can protect you from health problems such @CAPS1 diebities. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses. Being so drawn to your computer can @CAPS2 you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for atleast an hour a day you'll see fore sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 you from what realy matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are realy important and if you don't spend time with them they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so dont spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun, I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, @CAPS2 you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least a hour a day they'll live a happier, healthier life.

"Technology has been growing and changing rapidly. Just look at apples new @CAPS1, a desent rized touch screen computer. Computers have been rapidly changing too. But I think that @CAPS2 need to cut down on the use of electronics. Being one the computer for a long time and large amount of time can damage your eyesight, give you arthrightus and takes time @CAPS5 of exersizing; one of the thing manhy @CAPS2 need to do. Many @CAPS2 have been spending has too long on the computer, although it can be very useful it can also be very damaging to your eyesight many people spent large amounts of time staring at the computer screen. If you stair at something for too long it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because your trying @CAPS5 your eye lens. Also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes. The light coming on to your eyes is like staring at the sun but not quit as damaging. The sun will instatntly damage your eyes while overtime a computer slowly damges your eyesight. If your eyesight is already damaged a computer will worsen it. The more time spent on a computer the more you damage your vision. Since your eyes are already bad you might think ""well they can't get any worse."" @CAPS5 the truth is they can not only is the light and the amount of time spent during a being onthe computer damaging to people with @NUM1 vision but even more damaging to people without. can be genetic or common to people who constently their knuckles. It can also be common to people who spend exeessive amount of time on the computer. AIM is very popular to people of all ages. Its a way to instantly gossip or chat with freinds. But it takes alot of typing. Typing to long or to much can cause your fingers to lock up and it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain. if this constenity happens to you you could be a canidat for arthrightus. No letting your fingers take a break can also be one of the reasons your fingers hurt, if you never let them take a break they can also lock up and it can be very painful. You should spend less time on the computer if you don't want artrightus. Because of all this new technology less @CAPS2 go outside and play or hit the gym and exersize.

"Dear, @CAPS1 paper @CAPS2 The computers we have do benefits our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter.You could go on diffrent websites to help you learn what your stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called a @ORGANIZATION1. It goes over on waht you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's @NUM1 @NUM1/2 years old. Isn't that amazing on that computers can do. Next I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you @MONTH1 know.

You could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about @PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name and his biography came so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts you could type up papers and look up diffrent things you had to do in class.

"Dear Newspaper; I bileve that computers are good for our society. There are maney resons as to why I beleve this. One reson is that it makes life easior, it also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers how would we talk with people without phones and spred news. Computers make life easior by maney ways. For example, if you needed a docters permition to play a sport, it would be alot easior to send him/her an email telling him/her to send you can email saying you can you can show it to the sports team and they will alow you to play. We can also lirn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and go to a news website and look at the wether so we can make plans for the day. We can find the newest technology ""I phone"" or ""@CAPS1 "". There are some people in the world that don't but have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the airfore and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't alow phones. Also if there is a pirson with good news and they want tell a lot of people send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I beleve computers are a good thing to have in new society. I have that they make life easyor. It also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world. I hope you agree on my topic..This is a timeline of the history of hydrogen technology..TTM operates artifacts on the L&W as well as several model train layouts and many antique automobiles..In March 2011, AVIC Automobile Industry Holding Co., a Chinese state-owned parts manufacturer, purchased a 51 percent interest in Pacific Century Motors..The HTC Touch Cruise, also known as the HTC P3650 or its codename the HTC Polaris 100, is a Windows Mobile 6-powered Pocket PC..GeoEdge is a provider of ad security and verification solutions for the online and mobile advertising industry..The DWDD technology uses a physics phenomenon called domain wall displacement, which shortens the masks but does not need to change the laser beam."
"@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online for the games make it even more fun thus it make them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side.

"Dear @CAPS1, I thick this is a good idea because you can play games and talk to family or frends and lisen to music. My first reason is playing games. When you are bored and theres nothing to do all you can do is go on the computer and play all kinds of games like cars, shoting, arcade games to. You can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer. My seacond reason is talking to freinds or famiely. If your brother or sister or any of your family members live in a different state and you want to talk to them or see them then all you got to do is ask them ""@CAPS2 is your email address and then if they got a myspace or facebook then you could talk to them as long as you want. You can also talk to your friends on those websites to. My thied reason is lisening to music. You can also lison music on your computer bu going to @CAPS3 or downloading frostwire or something like that. You can lison to all kinds of music like hip-hop, rap rock, or havey rock. If you want to lison to any song your going to need the song's name and something the artistes name to.

"What is more fun, stairing at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beutifull nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family?

"Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?.The current ISO recommendation is Information technology, Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL), Part 3: Rule-based validation, Schematron (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2016)..His art is influenced by the development of consumerism, technology, identity and cyberculture in society, with a distinctive focus on obsolete media..The supply voltage (Vb) depends on APD technology used and typically varies between 20 V and 100 V, thus being from 15 to 75 times lower than the voltage required for a traditional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operation..Public reverse geocoding services are becoming increasingly available through APIs and other web services as well as mobile phone applications..Global Terror (also called Conflict: Global Storm) is a tactical shooter video game developed by Pivotal Games and Synergenix and published by SCi Games and 2K Games for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Microsoft Windows and Mobile phones..He is Emeritus Professor and Professorial Research Fellow at the University of Bristol, and a Professor at the University of Technology, Sydney."
"How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers..Written by Peaches, Simian Mobile Disco and Drums of Death, and produced by Peaches, Drums of Death and Shapemod, the song was released as the album's third single..The company launched content marketing, social media offerings, brand activation/digital marketing solutions and mobile apps development (native and browser based) in 2012 and 2013, and attracted several senior executives from Ogilvy & Mather, Saatchi & Saatchi, Acuity Group (now Accenture), CMA, among others..Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology is located on the borders of this village..The termite becomes immobile after 1 to 3 minutes, and completely paralyzed very soon after this, although it may live for up to 3 hours..This group is actively engaged in the development of experimental mobile robots for various unconventional applications..It forms part of the UK government's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)."
"Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds. Also, in todays world, waiting is almost non-existant. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things a lot this world is that we're all different, connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society. Conneticing through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us. But don't be fooled. It can also befor pleasure, say @CAPS3'son & buissness trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and steathily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is maraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be were we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research to day, than estatic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have kemotherapy. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analize research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life exsentency, and who doesn't want you've larger's some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why don't you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's advention, connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end..In April of 1922 Thompson, armed with drawings and data for a prototype synchromesh transmission, set out for Detroit to sell it to the automobile industry..Many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, while others are modified, such as combat, which is less cover-based and more mobile..She has written numerous articles on biotechnology that have been published in peer review journals and worked as an executive for different biotechnology companies and investment firms..Batteries Limited is an automobile and commercial Battery manufacturing company headquartered in Chennai, Tamil Nadu..The Huawei U1270 is a mobile phone released in 2009..SportSetter is a Finnish startup focused on a mobile-first fitness discovery and booking service."
"Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with. You can find plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. you can find dates on the computer, too and find information about certain eople too..The Florida Tech Panthers are composed of 22 teams representing the Florida Institute of Technology in intercollegiate athletics, including men and women's basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track and field..He has also been a consistent contributor at the Foo Camp events put on by O'Reilly Media and is a technology blogger..It is notable for operating on both desktop operating systems, like Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and mobile operating systems like Apple iOS, Google Android and Honeycomb, BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry Tablet OS (QNX), webOS, Symbian and Windows Mobile..Whilst the T in BTEC has been mistakenly understood to stand for Technician, according to the DFE (2016) it actually stands for Technology..Newspapers can be digitally published online or as a digital copy on a digital device, such as a mobile phone or an E Ink reader..It carries a dual-purpose ICM submunition warhead and incorporates Base bleed technology to increase its range."
"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computer are entertaning. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play videogames on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after @CAPS1 done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on facebook. You can just login and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computers to the other. My last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. People get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. These are my reasons that computers are good..It was formed in May 2016 after the amalgamation of the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic and Waiariki Institute of Technology..He is interested in micro/nanorobotics, nanomanufacturing, MEMS/NEMS, biomimetic micro/nanosystems, directed self-assembly, bionanotechnology, haptic interfaces, and tele-robotics..They are common in such applications in locomotives, aircraft refueling, freight elevators, lawn mowers, tractors, personal watercraft, outboard motors, chainsaws, snowblowers, tread machines, snowmobiles, amusement rides, and many medical imaging devices..In the unwired enterprise, client platform and operating system are deemphasized as focus shifts away from platform homogeneity to fluid and expedient data exchange and technology agnosticism..However, the NAPS technology was installed in the Fairlady/Z and sold internationally..The Ministry of Energy, Science & Technology, and Public Utilities (Belize) was founded in 2012."
"Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits..Modes of operation are by mobile van, book kiosk, book chest for community and schools and digital access..The program was created at the suggestion of Lockheed with participation from McDonnell Douglas, and after a year of technology validation it was merged into what would become the Joint Strike Fighter program..Founded in 1946, Bay State College specializes in career-focused programs, specifically in business, information technology and healthcare..IEEEmadC (Mobile Applications Development Contest) is an international contest organized by volunteers for IEEE student members across the globe..Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle..However, no matter how big the impact of this technology can be to industry and research, it still is in a very early stage of development compared to traditional computer vision."
"Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers I believe that computers can teach you things such as, hand-eye coordination and how that, can open job doors for you. Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, ""@CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?"", and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards..Game of War: Fire Age is a freemium mobile massively multiplayer online strategy video game developed and published in 2013 by Machine Zone (now known as MZ)..Founded in 2012, Gram Games has built a team of industry professionals focused on creating engaging games for mobile platforms..Telecommunications in Bulgaria include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet..Rupert Lee-Browne is a British businessman and technology investor..Winifred Holtby Academy (previously Bransholme High School, Winifred Holtby School, Winifred Holtby Technology College) is a coeducational secondary school located in the Bransholme area of Kingston upon Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England..Jawbreaker is a port of SameGame for the Pocket PC bundled with the Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 operating system for PDAs."
"@ORGANIZATION1, I would like to tell you computers are very helpful in our society today. Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up nig news & you needed to get it? Were did you turn to? I know not a book, but to the computer. Without it how were you going to get your info. I think computers are benefitial to our society because it can help you learn and it could tell you when or where to sign up for activities. People interact with others different countries, states, & or continents. Next, is how computer could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance today my class & I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers my class & I couldn't have get it done without the computers. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all & that would mean we would have to share. With sharing some kids @MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two. With computers we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computer can help set up activities. Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym signing up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance my little brother plays baseball & my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sihn up, register, & pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents didnt with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge & able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are benefitial to our new up & coming society!.Dasari Ramakotiah Institute of Science and Technology, popularly known to as ""DRKIST"", is an engineering college affiliated to the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University..In 2007, he dedicated himself to research concerning the scientific and philosophical foundations of technology and wellbeing..The project was originally headed by the Advanced Technology and Projects team within Motorola Mobility while it was a Google subsidiary..At present it consists of nine colleges and caters to more than 9,000 students in a range of disciplines including Pharmacy, Physical Education, Law, Management, International Travel and Tourism Management, History, Indology, Nursing, General Science, Commerce, Arts, Drawing and Painting, Home Science, and Computer and Information Technology..The MV Akdeniz is a 1955 built Turkish passenger ship that served on both ferry and cruise voyages for the Turkish Maritime Lines until she became a student accommodation and training ship in Tuzla, Istanbul Province for the Maritime Technology branch of the Istanbul Technical University..In the Spring of each year, the Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science & Technology budget proposal must be submitted to the School Boards of each of the four sending public school districts for approval or rejection."
"Computers. They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits man-kind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the otherhand, Computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy to use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all purpose dictinary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrasination is very easy to give into. But self control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework, and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound text book, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, excersising, and seing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landsacape. Self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this. I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer..The 2002 Boost Mobile V8 International was the twelfth round of the 2002 V8 Supercar Championship Series..A mobile dial code combines a toll-free number, a web address and a short code into one simplified number..Red Herring continues to publish technology sector news online..They also provide home and business software products for desktop, web and mobile users through their web sites..The United Nations Asian and Pacific Training Center for Information and Communication Technology for Development (UN-APCICT) aims to improve, for the region of Asia and Pacific, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) knowledge for long-term economic growth and sustainable development of the region..Brian Hills (born August 17, 1959) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former player currently the associate head coach for the Rochester Institute of Technology men's ice hockey team since 2005."
"Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @CAPS2 one week can @CAPS5 your vision from a @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you keep it up now it @MONTH1 not seem bad but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer..Quanta Technology LLC is a utility infrastructure consulting company based in Raleigh, North Carolina..Leona D.

"Computers are very important, I don’t know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager. Most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is myspace and facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but comp. have webcames so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do with out a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family membere there are mosly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it. This is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a comp. is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice dont spend all!! Day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy your self in any way possible..On August 30, 2016, he was recognized by the High Technology Crime Investigation Association with the HTCIA Lifetime Achievement Award, an annual recognition given to one individual with at least seven years membership, who has made significant contributions to HTCIA goals..The Informedia Digital Library is an ongoing research program at Carnegie Mellon University to build search engines and information visualization technology for many types of media..ASTEC was established in April 1977 as the Australian Science and Technology Council to advise the Australian government on matters relating to science and technology..They were acquired by Platinum Technology in 1998..Amadas Coach is a custom designer and builder of luxury motorhome conversions, luxury motor coaches and ""mobile marketing solutions""..GENI planning efforts are organized around several focus areas, including facility architecture, the backbone network, distributed services, wireless/mobile/sensor subnetworks, and research coordination amongst these."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 that use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus @CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for @CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. @CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example @CAPS2 fast is like texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to @CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is @CAPS3 somewhat. All people should have a computer. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and @CAPS2 make life better..Lagotek developed Home Intelligence Platform (HIP) technology..It is intended to provide the vocational education and training (VET) system with e-learning skills, professional development opportunities, products, resources and support networks to meet today's increasingly technology-driven learning environment..Her feedback has touched on issues such as proving the theft of intellectual property, fighting slander and copyrighting a new software concept""Legal Technology - The Dangers of Virtual Cocktail Parties..He was formerly the Chairman of the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology, and has served on the Boards of several companies, including Oxford Glycosciences, IDM-Pharma, and Mannkind..The solid surface of the encrustation begins softening and heaving, becoming mobile and gelatinous, and actually begins to dissolve the shoes of the investigators, as if it is attempting to digest them..The technology is a concept similar to Intel's SpeedStep technology."
"More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse..The LG Rumor (known as the LG Rumor and LG Rumeur in English and French Canadian markets respectively, or LG Scoop in other markets) is a mobile phone released by LG Electronics in September 2007..Professor Ross is the current Director of Media@McGill a research hub on issues of media, technology and culture at McGill University..The card is also supported by Vodafone Mobile Connect Card driver for Linux, and it is possible to monitor the signal strength through other Linux applications..APU provides undergraduate and postgraduate programs in the areas of information technology, media, business and engineering..A mobile version was released by Kiloo also in 2004; it is currently available for free..It is one of the main protocols introduced in the 5G Next Generation Mobile Core Network (aka 5GC), but also used in the 4G/LTE EPC to implement the Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS)."

"Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have an people are not good. They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before..The 1892 Georgia Tech football team represented the Georgia Institute of Technology during the 1892 college football season..In February 2010, Flook won the Mobile Premier Award in User Experience awarded by Mobile User Experience..The Blue Train Races were a series of record-breaking attempts between automobiles and trains in the late 1920s and early 1930s..A member of SWAPO, Tweya has served in the Cabinet of Namibia as Minister of Information, Communication and Technology since March 2015..The Hol-Tan was an American automobile manufactured in 1908..Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), also known as functional photoacoustic tomography (fPAT), is an imaging technology that generates high-resolution optical images in scattering media, including biological tissues."
"School, family, and sports is @CAPS5 my always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said ""you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic."" @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!.It is housed in the Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation (CCRG) at the Rochester Institute of Technology..He was appointed professor at the Norwegian Institute of Technology from 1962 to 1976, and from 1972 to 1976 he served as rector of the institute..The year 1830 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below..The Human Systems Integration Division is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) research organization which is part of the Exploration Technology Directorate at NASA Ames Research Center..Today, Telenor Sweden has over 2.5 million mobile subscribers, approximately 645,000 broadband customers and half a million TV customers..It is the first technology park in the Central American region."
"Computers. An achievement @MONEY1 technology and science that improve all @MONEY1 our lives. They let you explore the world in one click and chat with your friends. What could be wrong with that? I'll tell you. I belive that computers are ruining our society. Now don't get me wrong, I like them, but they can be bad. People get on and never get off, you never no who it is your chating with online, and they can cause tons @MONEY1 stress. Let me explain why computers can ruin lives. When the computer was invented I'm sure this wasn't the purpose. To stay on playing mindless games, or randomly searching the web. Some scientists have even studied the @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the time, the more you are online, the more likely chance you will become obiece. That is not what @LOCATION1 needs. You say you'll be on for a minute, but you will stay playing ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" for days on end. People with @CAPS3 work to do might never get on. Also it is just flat out a waste @MONEY1 time when you could be outside playing a @CAPS3 game. My second reason is that when you are ""chatting"" or ""@CAPS4'ing"" someone, who is it really? A study conducting proved that when you think your talking to a friends it is really some perverted @NUM1 year-old looking for ""fun."" @CAPS5 huh? Also when you talk, someone could be inbedding a virus in your system that could take @MONEY1 to fix. How mad would your parents be? It could be happening with every letter you press. Finally stranger or not, some @MONEY1 these people leave links to get to disgusting websites that you pray your parents don't see. My final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress. When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty fueds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damge to your grades. For every @NUM2 people when join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, afffecting their quality @MONEY1 work. In this economy I don't think we need more layoffs. Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get sucked in stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad..In technology, response time is the time a system or functional unit takes to react to a given input..Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, or a resource room..A less expensive call path is available by routing within the local Mobile Switching Center without going out to the global GMSC to its HLR..Process technology node is the size of the smallest features that the facility is capable of etching onto the wafers..Majhighariani Institute of Technology and Science (or MITS) is located in Rayagada, Orissa, India..Initially funded by SoftBank, the company's mission was to ""democratize technology."""
"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I belive that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communication with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or videochat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends. Computers are great..Originally released in North America for the PlayStation 2 in October 2002, it was released in November for the Game Boy Advance, in December for the Xbox and GameCube, and in May 2003 for mobile..It is known as one of the largest mobile ad platforms with over 120,000 live apps utilizing its SDK..From the 1950s to late 1980s, most major matches and title changes happened at house shows, largely due to the costs to produce a TV show at the time, plus the lack of more modern technology making it significantly harder to tape a TV show..Cellular Abroad is a mobile virtual network operator and internet retailer based in Los Angeles that uses GSM technology to provide international wireless voice, messaging and data services..A mobile app was released on April 18, 2018..Surface activated bonding (SAB) is a low temperature wafer bonding technology with atomically clean and activated surfaces."
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't live to go on the computer? Well myspace, facebook and aim is like a online hangout. Kids every where log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before. Sometimes the best thing to @CAPS1 is get some fresh air and interact with others. Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . Most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student at @ORGANIZATION3 middle school in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 recently you produced an article about computers where good or bad people I write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. This is true because computers help people with things hand eye coordination to learning advances to our schools finally it helps people communicate with ease, @CAPS7 plase consider the following. First of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using ther hands and eyes together. @ORGANIZATION1 ullodhers from @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1 ""Computers help hand eye coordination @PERCENT1 more than putting your son or daughter on the football team"" @CAPS8 computer games could help kids get more acurate with there skills or that of any sport. @CAPS7 now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination. Secondly Computers help people learn new things. Although people might think to be false it is indeed true. @ORGANIZATION1 a recent study at @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT2 of schools in @CAPS6 use computers for research.Finally recently had a paper about @PERSON2 and The only scorce I thought of was wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. @CAPS7 now you understand the computer is a helpful learning tests. Finally the computer is a great way to communicate online. It is better than @CAPS10 because it is faster and more than calling someone up and talking for. @CAPS8 it is alot cheper than @CAPS10 because you just have @NUM1 payment a-month unlike phone. Where it starts to add up. Inract @PERSON1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 of @LOCATION1 in a recent study that ""@CAPS10 are absolete now, with the internet peope can chat at lignning speed"". Finally using e-mail or facebook is @CAPS7 much better than phone tag on facebook you know where you can chat with. @CAPS7 thats my reasons that the computer is good for communicating. @CAPS7 now you see that computers are nessecery because they develop hand eye coordination, they @CAPS8 help people learn and finally they are a great way to communicate..The company was established as an in-house asset management company for Tsinghua's subsidiaries that were established in 1990s by the technology transfer of research to business..In the Fraser Institute's report on Ontario schools for the 2012-2013 year, the school was ranked 39 out of 740 secondary schools with an overall rating of 8.3/10.The Film Production and IB Film Studies program (Communications Technology) at the school is an advanced program with both Mac and PC labs..In November 2016, Alterian divested from SDL and was acquired by Alterian Technology Holdings LLC, a privately owned company based in the US..Definity is a digital film recorder for motion picture applications, produced by CCG Digital Image Technology, the successor of Agfa-Gevaert's film recorder division..Hans Roger Snook (born 26 May 1948) is a businessman, best known for his time as the founder, with Graham Howe and Chief Executive of UK mobile phone company Orange..Dynamic creative optimization (DCO), is a form of programmatic advertising that allows advertisers to optimize the performance of their creative using real-time technology."

The internt is a never ending sorce of knolage and you can learn just about any thing that you need to know just by searching it on the computor.Another usefull thing the computor dose is the ability to talk to people useing eother @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 or that rooms you can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relitive on the computor and you can even hook up a web camera and actuly see theam as they talk to you something a phone cannot do. Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up. And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had. And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real. Now I have mentioned some of the many thing why you can never spend enuf time on the computer shure exersise and nator can be helth but you can do only of that stuff I just mentond by takeing a nator walk so wont you agree computors improve our life more then they are unhealthy..HBTU is the mother institute of the National Sugar Institute (in 1936, then known as Imperial Institute of Sugar Technology), the Government Central Textile Institute (in 1937), now known as the Uttar Pradesh Textile Technology Institute,IIT Kanpur in 1960, the Glass Institute..Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels..The articles are visually interactive, and highly optimized for mobile..Her principal topics of interest are media, technology, and the global circulation of images..PA Consulting Group is a consultancy specializing in management consulting, technology and innovation..A rundown of the things from technology, sports and entertainment is covered by the show."
"Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. @CAPS1 opinion is computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @CAPS1 side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has @CAPS2, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The goof of is you can get those chorse. Oh not that make me to. @CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. @CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. Excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many shore. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend, ""yo sup man,"" ""not, you"" ""not much, just fiding around for some exercise"" ""same here, same here"" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @CAPS1 friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. Like i said be what was @CAPS1 friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So @CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love @CAPS1 family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @CAPS3 time with family and friends..It is a collection of automobiles, aircraft, and railway vehicles..The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is an agency of the United States Department of Commerce that deals with issues involving national security and high technology..The company uses nanometer-scale particle technology in developing new drugs and in increasing the efficacy of existing drugs..The flagship Offshore Technology Conference is held annually during early May in Houston, Texas, USA since 1969..The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2008, for his contributions to chemical sciences..He is an IBM Fellow, a member of the IBM Academy of Technology, an IEEE Fellow, and an Electrochemical Society Fellow."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions.

"Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 I think that kid's should be alowed to go on here computers. So they can talk to there relitives across. The @CAPS5 @CAPS2 they want to. I have family members in @LOCATION1. I talk to them evry day because I have a laptop and they say that. I have relitives in @LOCATION3 I belive them because I have there email. They told me about my mother living in @LOCATION2. So I asked her she seaid yes that is true and I looked up were my mom lived. Thanks to computer also I learned that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in The @CAPS5. So I asked my mom @CAPS2 I can go to @LOCATION3 she said yes. So I went with my sister and we even visited are family members and the @CAPS6 point I can tell you it looked exacly how. I pichered very tall coverd with trees. Birds @CAPS7, scwerwels climing trees the thing, that surprised me the most was there was a house on top of the mountine. For sale I wished that my mom was thier because she will love it. So ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers. Lastly you can even look up people on the internet. I herd that criss rock almost died. So when I got home I went on my laptop and looked it up so I did and it said nothing about. That but it did say one thing that surprised me. The most it seaid that he was geting a divorce. From his wife I think the peorson how said. That he almost died most of missed read it. So now I look up all my fraverit people.

"My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. ""But"" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU).

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive affects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting, without exercise and aren't nessasary..The Hospital was a pioneering initiative, established under the Chairmanship of Late Deshamanya H. K.

"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat thier friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer..The Sarvajanik College of Engineering and Technology (SCET) is an engineering college that is a part of the Sarvajanik Education Society..Solar thermal energy (STE) is a form of energy and a technology for harnessing solar energy to generate thermal energy or electrical energy for use in industry, and in the residential and commercial sectors..For twelve years he hosted the annual JavaOne conference, bringing 20,000 Java programmers to San Francisco and establishing the Java language in over 95% of mobile devices, and as the basis of the Android operating system..Christopher ""Chris"" Hedrick (born 1962) is an entrepreneur and expert in global health, international development, technology, and learning..Dumkal Institute of Engineering & Technology (DIET), in Dumkal, Murshidabad, West Bengal, India offers degree engineering courses which are affiliated to West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT)..In early 2009, the Palexpo underwent a renovation project to enhance and improve the convention center's architecture, furnishings and technology."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those @PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room.

"Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relitive move, when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of you run stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people ""skype"" on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new ""social networking series"" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways..Syncron was ranked as the fastest growing supply chain management software supplier for 2007 and 2008, in the annual Deloitte Fast 500 Technology Awards, EMEA region..Stereolithography (SLA or SL; also known as stereolithography apparatus, optical fabrication, photo-solidification, or resin printing) is a form of 3D printing technology used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production of parts in a layer by layer fashion using photopolymerization, a process by which light causes chains of molecules to link, forming polymers..He was formerly a Research Fellow and subsequently Director of the Environment and Technology Program of the Institute of Economic Affairs..Drive testing is a method of measuring and assessing the coverage, capacity and Quality of Service (QoS) of a mobile radio network..The majority of his career has been spent at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, which he helped to establish at the University of Illinois in 1989..Carcraft Engineering was a British manufacturer of automobiles ."
"Dear Newspaper, I think computers are a good thing, people use computers for buissness. Computers allow you to interact with people far away. They also allow you to do research. That is why I think computers are good. Computers can be used for many different things. They can be used for buissness. Some people work at home on computers. They can also be used to interact with people far away. You can interact with someone who you don't see on a daily basis. Computers can also be used for research. You can do research on a school project or on other buissnesses you interact with. Computers are good. Some people use computers for buissness. You can also interact with people far away.

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The age of the computer is upon us. Every where you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree, I feel that the computer is a great @CAPS5 to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society..The Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS), the Master of Science in Management Information Systems (MSMIS), and Masters in Management Information Systems are specialized master's degree programs usually offered in a university's College of Business and in integrated Information Science & Technology colleges in recent years..It is India's first ISO 9001:2008 company in mobile value-added services area..Sony Xperia T (renamed Sony Xperia TL in the United States) is an Android smartphone manufactured by Sony Mobile..The conference name is a satirical portmanteau of Pirillo's Lockergnome and the now-defunct Comdex technology trade show, which was a massive and influential annual event at the time of the first Gnomedex conference..The selective admissions program was initiated in 1985 through the cooperation of state and county governments, as well as corporate sponsorship from the defense and technology industries..The company was headed by Chip Howes, whose team is the inventor of record for over 30 patents in the area of TCP/IP server load balancing, and are credited with the invention of the technology in 1996."
"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 ""isn't that great""!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt .These types of memories are frequently used in microcontrollers, video game consoles, mobile phones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, implantable medical devices, high-definition multimedia interfaces (HDMI) and in many other consumer and automotive electronics products..On September 13, 1940, it was merged with the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to form the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad..Formerly she was a Visiting Research Scholar at Princeton University's Center for Information Technology Policy and a Distinguished Scholar of Technology and Public Engagement of the School of Social Transformation Justice and Social Inquiry Program and the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University..Sherzan was born in Mobile, Alabama..However, current technology is less intrusive and because of privacy issues most people are allowed to refuse this scan and opt for a traditional pat-down..However, American farmers gained partial protection with the ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. which had issued an estoppel, ordering Monsanto not to sue farmers for patent infringement should they become contaminated by trace amounts of Monsanto's patented seed technology."
"Dear local news paper, In @CAPS1 oppinion I think that those who makes compiuters should make up an times added to the compiuters. There should be a law that people has to go out and exercise before and after then use compiuters finally, I think that childrens should use the compiuter less than the adult fee health reasons. @CAPS1 first oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should make timers added to the compiuters to time tha amount of tim people should take depending on what they are doing like when some one is playing a game they spend hours playin instead of doing a diffrent activity. Also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad. @CAPS1 second oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have a law that people has to go out and exersise before and after they use compiuter because there is a big percentage amount of people who are obeast because everyone sits in the sits in the compiuters and starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours and they dont take a break to go outside and @CAPS1 third and final oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have childrens use the compiuter less than the adults for health reason's because kids are always looking at the compiuters an their eyes are always getting red and then they start to not being able to see as well as they used to then they end up having to need glasses or abetter perpscription glasses. Also becaus kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people who they dont know so they end up getting raped or kidnapped by the person that they went to talked to for hours. So local news paper will you make that change for the society and for the childrens? Because I would!.The campaign incorporated use of a variety of websites under false names, including the Ride Institute of Technology, LaMarcus Brothers Mid-Air Excavation, and O'Connell Plumbing & Drain..Its three major activities are manufacturing and marketing of bulk drugs, also known as API, (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), pharmaceutical formulation and fermentation & biotechnology..PerkinElmer, Inc., is an American multinational corporation focused in the business areas of human and environmental health, including: environmental analysis, food and consumer product safety, medical imaging, drug discovery, diagnostics, biotechnology, industrial applications, and life science research..It seeks to effectively use resources and technology to assist the bishops in proclaiming the Good News of Jesus and sharing the teachings of the Catholic Church..Roxborough High School's (CTEs) include Web Design, Cinematography, International Business, and Biotechnology..Nanotronics Imaging is a nanotechnology startup in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio."
"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most imfortant thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time.

"Dear @LOCATION1, I understand this focus situation, the effect of computers or our society people's reactions are less than about them & my question to is who? Computers a very good effect on our town's specify. Computers areaids in tracking hand-eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things & talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty. Let me explain more these reasons. Computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand-eye coordination to kids & adults. Just to help you understand why in to teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you. In foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself. In baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill, but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone & hurt them, ability to day back. Computers are great way to this skill in a saw Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to do have a good our town? Well, computers let people to that. You can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have I do have another reason. Computers have to samethings electronically so fast easily, make a look on computer's hard drives, @CAPS2 are so much more that ran be on a computer, that make a room empty. Before my famiy had a computer complete dedicated to papers files that your so important & that we could not lose. When up got picture, typed up paper, saved our was empty! I hope that this letter has proves to you computers effect on our society. Computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination.

"Dear @PERSON1, Experts are concerned about the use of computers. They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree. While people use the computers, they don’t interact and meet new friends in person. They stay inside and don't get excersise, and kids might talk with strangers. When we use computers we chat with friends online and don't really interact with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize, so that is one disadvantage of a computer. Another problem is lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy. Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers. Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info. Kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. Kids and even adults dont interact with freinds, lack exercise, and give personal information to strangers..It was first conceived as a project in Microsoft Research India's Technology for Emerging Markets in 2006 by Rikin Gandhi and his colleagues..It should not be confused with the Yale automobile made in Saginaw, Michigan from 1916 to 1918..Remote scripting is a technology which allows scripts and programs that are running inside a browser to exchange information with a server..The site is the latest technology news sites launched by Mike Magee, who originally co-founded The Register in 1994..The leading Telecommunications operator of the Nagorno Karabakh is Karabakh Telecom, and the telecommunications sector was developed with Karabakh Telecom investing millions of dollars in mobile telephony, spearheaded by a Lebanese company..The new show did not continue to discuss the media or technology; instead, the media analysis theme was picked up by a different new CBC series, MediaWatch."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them.

Computers are important to society because it helps keep track of info like doctor appointments and crimnal records for police to follow by. having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes. Having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved and have website that they can talk to you on like myspce or facebook or even yahoo chat. When having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas. Computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school. Having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses.

"Dear @CAPS1 I think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. Because right now some job are going bank ruded. And parants can not help because they didn't have job to support there love ones. Another thing is that cars are going up on prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car and truck for great prices.

"According to the @ORGANIZATION1 govermant @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer a day. A study shows @CAPS1 are't getting enough exercise, aren't spending enough time with fmaily, aren't enjoying their lives. Right now people would rather be on the computer then doing other stuff.Since more people have been using the computer those people heven't enough exercise. Now @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have gone obese since they have always been or the computers, @CAPS4 year a @CAPS6 was fit and healthy, but when a friend told him about a website within the @CAPS5 @NUM2 minutes. After @NUM1 months, the fit and healthy @CAPS6 became obese. The @CAPS6 would always have junk food when @CAPS7 was on the computer. when @DATE1 came, @CAPS7 tryed out for his school baseball team. @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 was out of shape. After that happened, @CAPS7 went to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport @CAPS7 plays. Next people aren't spending enough time with their families. A lot of jobs require people to be on the computer. When that happens a person will forget whats really important to them. A couple years ago, a @CAPS6 was going to have the biggest game of his life. It was the championship game. @CAPS7 was reminding his dad about it all. When the gone was about to start, the @CAPS6 looked into the crowd for his dad. @CAPS7 didn't see him at all. The @CAPS6 was just think his dad was. after the @CAPS5, @CAPS7 looked again, but now @CAPS7 was sad. His own dad wasn't at the game. His team @CAPS4 the game. Now his dad doesn't miss a thing since @CAPS7 doesn't go on the computer as often. Finally, people aren't enjoying their lives they would rather be on a computer than doing stuff they like. One @CAPS6 used to always play basketball with his friends when @CAPS7 started to go on the computers, everything changed people would ask him to play, but @CAPS7 would say no. The computer was the only things that mattered. When the @CAPS6 tryed out for his @CAPS8 school @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 forgot how to play. When that happened, @CAPS7 stopped using the computer and went back to basketball. now when @CAPS7 tries out., @CAPS7 makes.

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun..Dr. Narita is currently senior advisor for science and technology at the US Office of Naval Research's International Field Office, Asia..Filming took place at Cornish College of the Arts; UC Berkeley; Duke University; University of Florida; Princeton University, for the section about Josue Lajeunesse; the California Institute of Technology; and Cornell University..A mobile Internet device (MID) is a multimedia-capable mobile device providing wireless Internet access..The patents for the technology are now owned by a British company based in Redhill, amBX UK LTD..The curricula offered by the school are Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics Program (formerly, Science and Technology Engineering Program [STEP] and Special Science Curriculum), Basic Education Curriculum (BEC), Special Program for Sports (SPS), Special Program for the Arts (SPA), Technical Vocational Education (TVS), BP-OSA for out of school youths, and Special Program in Journalism (SPJ)..Although the term was not actually used in the body text of Leonard's article, the headline encapsulated a collaboration between users of the internet technology blog Slashdot and a writer for Jane's Intelligence Review."

"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on youtube and type in""nike sb skate lair demo"" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount..He received a B.S. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970 and then moved to Harvard University for his graduate studies, receiving a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1973 under the supervision of Roger W.

"I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers. In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business of work related. But then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day. What they could be doing is enjoying life. Going outside and getting fresh air. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites. Such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are obsessed so thoes are teo websites that are very addicting to some people. and then these are the people who just like looking things up. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. And use the computer only when you need to. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment. But all things are good in moderation. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers.

"Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today..Racelogic Ltd is an automotive technology company based in Buckingham, United Kingdom..It does this by buying used electronics, especially mobile phones, from consumers and companies to repair them and give them a second life..Nova Founders Capital is a London and Hong Kong-based venture capital firm and business incubator specializing in financial technology and other internet technologies related to financial services..Sineskwela was a Filipino children's television series produced by ABS-CBN Foundation, Science Education Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS)..Vladimir (Vlad) M.

"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?.Bass was also co-founder of Starlight Networks in late 1990, a software company involved in streaming media and Socket Mobile, Inc. in 1992..As professional-grade technology has become more accessible, amateurs hoping to enter the film industry have turned to the micro movie format to avoid limitations imposed by television and film studios..Oregon Coast Technology School, also known as ORCO TECH, is a public charter school in North Bend, Oregon, United States..In 2007, a sequel was released on mobile phone as an incarnation of Metal Saga and was released in Japan in 2007..The ATMS view is a top-down management perspective that integrates technology primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and improve safety..Established in 2009, the organization offers courses in computer technology, as well as IT products, web design and site hosting, and technical networking and computer maintenance support services."
"Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers..Rendezvous, famously known as RDV is the annual Cultural Festival of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi..JURIX is a foundation based in the Netherlands that deals with legal subjects in relation to information technology and especially interconnects computer and legal scientists from that country..The company offers services, software and infrastructure in information and communications technology for telecommunications operators, traditional telecommunications and Internet Protocol (IP) networking equipment, mobile and fixed broadband, operations and business support services, cable television, IPTV, video systems, and an extensive services operation..VANAS offers vocational Certificates, Diplomas and university pathways in a variety of art and technology, media and design fields..It specializes in the fields of engineering and technology..Lightweight User Interface Toolkit (LWUIT) is a Widget toolkit developed by Sun Microsystems to enable easier Java ME user interface development for existing devices, including not only traditional Java ME environments like mobile phones, but also TVs and set top boxes."
"Many families across the globe use computers, whether their from @LOCATION1, all the way to the deserts of @LOCATION2. However, believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise, In @CAPS21 perspective. I can agree, with there, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computer on @CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?"" that is where students can got their @CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many shops like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a catolog online, where you and effenly. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and @CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily. These are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many @CAPS16 you can play, like @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14-@CAPS15 @CAPS16) I play many of these, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17. I love these @CAPS16 because they are very amusing world. You watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via @CAPS18. @CAPS18 is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. A @CAPS18 video is ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22,"" a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored. I can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @CAPS16 called @CAPS23. With this, you can play many fun @CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science. In @CAPS21 science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motion/gravity.

"I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day..The purpose of GNI is to promote the industry and the economy in Greater Nagoya area so as to attract companies, technology, people, and information to foreign companies to invest in the area..The Renault MT was a compact sport automobile manufactured by Renault from 1923 to 1925..At the 1995 BETT Educational Computing & Technology Awards, the software won Gold in the primary category..During the 2004-2005 academic year, he briefly held the presidency of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and subsequently joined TriNet, Inc. as Vice President, Human Capital Consulting, and then later Deloitte Consulting LLP..Aviary powers numerous mobile applications, including its self-titled iOS and Android apps, and a Windows app called Photo Editor..Buffer is a software application for the web and mobile, designed to manage accounts in social networks, by providing the means for a user to schedule posts to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Linkedin, as well as analyze their results and engage with their community."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, More and more people use commputers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society and I am one of theose people, that does not agree. I disagree, because is your on the computer all day you'll forget bout things. For example, you will forget to exercise, you will forget nature, you will also forget to interact with your friends and family. I promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view. People soend to much time on the computer, and they don't exercise like they should. Exerising is very important, that helps you with . Exercising helps you grow. it makes you stronger. If your on the computer all day then, you'll exercise and develop right. Another reason, I think its such a lead idea is you do not get to enjoy nature. When your on your computer you can not go on an hike in the woods. You can not go on camping trip. You can not do the thing, in the pleasant air of nature. The last reason but defenitly not the least you will forget to interact with your friends and family. That is so important because a computer could do a lot. It could teach you a lot but it canot do it you and @MONTH1 I love you. Only youre family and friends could do that. Hopfully you under and realize my point of view. People should stop doing this you forget to exercise nature and to spend time with you friends and family.

"Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me thats very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ingnore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your soical activitys with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exerise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you..The company would be finally absorbed by Kovatch Mobile Equipment Corp (KME) in the late 1970s..He was director of DevGen and CropDesign and is a director of the biotech companies Ablynx, Peakadilly, Actogenix, EMBLEM (technology transfer company of EMBL) and FlandersBio..Radiate is a mobile app that connects people going to the same music festival as one another..Bisnovatyi-Kogan was a student at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology from 1958-1964..Kemuda Institute mainly provides vocational courses in computing and information technology, leading up to BTEC qualification by Pearson as well as diplomas by NCC Education, two UK-based vocational qualifications providers..Additionally, because the company was on the leading edge of technology and internet solutions, they set up some of the first ever websites for the toy industry, including megalithic domains for Bandai America, Speed Racer and Whac-A-Mole."
"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 back a couple decades ago, before computers existed. What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, @PERSON2 had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children's computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""@CAPS3"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person , only through technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I @CAPS6 urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today..The work of Dr. Marilyn J. Bull to help shape automobile safety law in Chile was highlighted in March 2017 by AAP News..Christians have made a myriad contributions to human progress in a broad and diverse range of fields, both historically and in modern times, including the science and technology, medicine, fine arts and architecture, politics, literatures, Music, philanthropy, philosophy, ethics, theater and business..Since 2016, the VIZIV concept cars have previewed styling for upcoming production automobiles, and the hybrid powertrain has been dropped in favor of a conventional gasoline engine and all-wheel-drive..GreatCall offers health and safety products and services for older adults, including mobile devices, cellular service, mobile apps and a wearable device..This model uses a technology platform, often accessed via mobile phone, to connect suppliers willing to rent assets (e.g., apartments for rent or cars for transportation services) with consumers..He was the CEO and founder of technology startup Datapad."
"Dear @CAPS1, I beleave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on peope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that atleast @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people.

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology was grown exponetially during the last few years. The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I beleive this is not somthing to be excited about. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. The ove useage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure. Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healty, only use the computer when it's absolutely neccesary. Going on all the time can seperate you from others. This g eneration, adolecents especailly, use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family. Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can became a non-important thing. People can't pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing, even nature. Humans started out living i nthe wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting. Our connection with nature was strong. We needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People do not appreciated nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1. com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when neccesary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside..Through three transactions that he negotiated - the purchase of complete ownership of NSN, the sale of the handset business to Microsoft and the recently announced acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent - Nokia has transformed from a bankruptcy candidate to a successful global technology leader..Lieutenant General Kent Richard Foster CMM, CD (born c. 1938) was the Commander Mobile Command of the Canadian Forces..Also recently built was an additional hallway for health, second language, technology, and the academy classes..Physical design flow uses the technology libraries that are provided by the fabrication houses..He obtained BTech degree from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 1996 and PhD degree from Cornell University under the guidance of D.C.

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a world without computers. I picture it as a better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world better. Computers @MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer having computers or no? In my opinion people would be better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers is one factor to blame with the @LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy. If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in @LOCATION2 will as well. If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 says ""if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them"" @CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue. In my opinion the citizens of @LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their. more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly when your on your computer all day you don't realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals. Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more, computer should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer. @CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least your social life could improve if people werent on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would be better off without computers. I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise, enjoy for nature, also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from. There is no need for a computer in your life, but don't speak for everyone. The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good..AFS Trinity Power Corporation is an American corporation headquartered in Medina, WA with an engineering center in Livermore, CA that develops technology for plug-in hybrids..MoSync was developed by the Swedish software company MoSync AB (formerly Mobile Sorcery AB)..Many experts believe that the future of computer technology rests in mobile computing with wireless networking..The purpose of CPRI is to allow replacement of a copper or coax cable connection between a radio transceiver (used example for mobile-telephone communication and typically located in a tower) and a base station (typically located at the ground nearby), so the connection can be made to a remote and more convenient location..His four sons, Shane, Jack, John and Bob, have launched more than a dozen startup companies dealing in clothing, furniture, technology, and eyeglasses..TechSkills is a nationally recognized career training school, specializing in skills and certification training for careers in Information Technology, Healthcare Services and Business."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now..Over the course of its history, BTL has published titles on politics, public policy, labor, critical race, international development, Indigenous peoples, gender and sexuality, history, health, adult and popular education, environment, technology, and media..Due to the pressures of overconsumption, population and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently..It provides engineering qualifications in CSE, ECE, EEE, Mechanical engineering and Information Technology..With this technology, Earth developed giant robotic machines (many of which were capable of transforming into vehicles) to fight three successive extraterrestrial invasions..He worked for five years as a science/technology journalist for Business Week magazine, and he has consulted widely on the uses of computers in education..Dr. Moalem is an expert in the fields of rare diseases, neurogenetics, and biotechnology."
"I think that people shouldnt use the computer's that much because it make's you want to be on it and on it day. Like yea you can play games on it and talk to people like other people you use of lec see I can understand that but the other people around you like that live's with you people that on the computer all day can spend time with there family and friends and to other places then going to look at them on the computer's I mean like to see other people that you see on the computer like chat or like webcam on the computer, you can maybe go see in a other state and go visited them. then being on the computer people that always on the computer should get out because there never going to do things is they are always on the computer, like when @CAPS1 on the computer @CAPS1 on it for a hour are so the I do things with family and friends, but not all the time that @CAPS1 on it, like i understand if you work on the computer at work and then finishing things at home for your work, but once in a you get to spend some time with family and friends, not @CAPS4 be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and @CAPS4 go on the computer and that how people get lazy the start getting fat because they @CAPS4 go on the it and maybe stop to eat and back on the computer, then when they get off of it they will eb all tierd and stuff not feeling like going anywere @CAPS4 to sleep or like if they had sometimes to do after they would be all lazy an not wanted to do anything at all, that why people should get out more and do thing withe there family and friends to have fun withe there like..Chapter 10, ""The Copyright Wars"", considers the use of digital rights management in the motion picture and music industries, including DeCSS on DVDs, and the lack of widespread adoption of a similar technology on music CDs..Because this is an emerging technology, the standard is designed to encourage innovation by reaching consensus on a common definition, terminology, framework, goals, metrics, and use-cases that encourage innovation and enable the technology to advance at a faster rate..The current editors-in-chief are Richard P.

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 society should have computers because it teaches you things that a school or job will never teach you, and it allows you to be in contact with your friends and family that you don't see a lot. I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @CAPS1 society should have computers. First, we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before. I say this because if you wanna know about the @LOCATION1 more and the school or job doesn't teach you as much as you wanna know, then all you have to do is look up on the internet and theres a chance you gonna find it. @NUM1 people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 society because we could contact people online that we heven't spoke to. My opinion is that if you haven't to a friend or family member in a while you can talk to them online. Also, if they don't have a phone or if they do but it's long distance and you can't talk to long distance on your phone, you can tlak to them on or email each other, etc. Sample say if your phone isn't working and the only thing that's working is your computer you to it in contact with somebody. All you gotta do is talk to them online. Would you rather talk on the phone or computer. In conclusion, @CAPS1 society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people. I would like for you to aprreciate my concern on having computers in @CAPS1 society..A wheel tax is a vehicle registration fee commonly used on automobiles generally less than 8000 pounds in the United States by some cities and counties..It is the company's first 3D mobile game..InternetQ is a technology company that develops and markets mobile related services through software platforms..The BYD L3 (or BYD F5 and BYD New F3 in Latin America) is a car manufactured by BYD Co., Ltd., a Chinese automobile manufacturer based in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province..It was rechristened G.

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I don’t think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldn’t you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldn’t get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldn’t get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society..59th Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards was held on January 8, 2008 at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas..As of 2016 he is the Chancellor of the University of South Australia, Chair of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization and holds directorships and board positions with a number of private and public companies..Matryoshka's logo represents a stylised matryoshka doll sporting headphones and the name of the station, Matryoshka Radio London, as well as the technology it broadcasts in, DAB..Amkor Technology, Inc. is a semiconductor product packaging and test services provider..Raritan is a multinational technology company that manufactures hardware for data center power distribution, remote server management, and audio visual solutions..SCSD7 also hosts the McCarthy-Teszler School, the Madden Learning Center, and shares the Daniel Morgan Technology Center with Spartanburg County School District 3."
"Computers can be very useful to people. They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet. If you had a friend or family member move away, computers are an easy way to contact them. Phones dont always give you that option to call from around the world. Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers. What if you want to chat with someone right next door even if theres a blizzard and the snow is four feet, computers are a simple way to contact them. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 for the @DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all? Imagine you, writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday. Typing is an easy solution that doesnt require as much work and it takes less time. Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read. Not even a library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library wont immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully? You cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport. You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 it upon google"" when they dont know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog, I never even heard of. When I got home I went on the internet and researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and its fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper..In video technology, blanking level is the level of the composite video signal during the front and back porches of the video signal..ScienceWorks in Ashland, Oregon, is a museum dedicated to educating visitors in science and technology, while providing an entertaining destination for a family outing..Virotherapy is a treatment using biotechnology to convert viruses into therapeutic agents by reprogramming viruses to treat diseases..His areas of specialization include Artificial intelligence-Applications in LIS, Natural language processing, Digital Libraries, Hypertext and Multimedia applications, Institutional repository, Open-source software used in Libraries, Open Access to Information, Semantic Web Technology, Free and open source software etc..Access Media Network (AMN) is a business automation and technology organization unifying speech, music, audio, images and movies with two-way communications..The TA was most recently led by former Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology Robert Cresanti."
"To my opinion computers have a negative effect on people I think it has a negative because it causes people to get less exercise you spend less time with your family and friends and it distracts you from things get done. First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games practicingg these they will just computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done. WIthout even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college those things include getting out around, but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends. i went over my I sat right and she didn't even look at me playing computer games. i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer. Lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them. It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because, they are absorbent in they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're budy playing game or surfing the web. i know that if I did I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because, it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people, as much, and it distract them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less those on the computer!.Mobile had been the last important port on the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi River remaining in Confederate possession, so its closure was the final step in completing the blockade in that region..She leads the research on CSIRO's patented microencapsulation system, a high-tech ingredient-delivery technology..He is a consulting participant at the annual Offshore Technology Conference (OTC)..He graduated from Cornell University with a B.A., and from Massachusetts Institute of Technology with an M.S. in documentary filmmaking..It was developed by Magno Edilberto R.

"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising.

So you decide @ORGANIZATION1, should @CAPS5 be outside more? Don’@CAPS2 you need to know whats going on too? Of course you @CAPS7, everyone does. I think that it is important that @CAPS5 know @CAPS4 a meteor is about to strike the world no? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets info. On whats going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? Don’@CAPS2 think so. Im @PERCENT1 sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn’@CAPS2 want to be known as the accident State. Well thats why @CAPS5 need the computer! For people to know if I will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic than @CAPS5 need to go to the internet to find out @CAPS4 and where and what time. CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says “@CAPS4 someone says ‘@CAPS5 might be getting some snow or rain’ than they usually go right to the internet ” You you can turn on your @CAPS2.V. to find out whats going on, but not all of it you will want/need to know. So you will have to wait. The internet just does it right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection) @CAPS7 you think these reasons are making a good argument? I @CAPS7. @CAPS7 you use your computer for finding out whats going on, what the weather is like, and instead of the @LOCATION2? If so I think you would aggree with me..Located in Morris County, New Jersey, it is a joint endeavor between the Morris County School of Technology and the Morris Hills Regional District..The founder and former CEO of travel industry research firm PhoCusWright, Wolf serves as board director and advisor to multiple travel and technology companies..It is the hardware that is connected to the mobile phone network that communicates directly wirelessly with mobile handsets (UEs), like a base transceiver station (BTS) in GSM networks..Businesses operated by EnPro Industries include Compressor Products International, Fairbanks Morse Engine, Garlock Sealing Technologies, GGB Bearing Technology, Technetics Group and STEMCO..The BlackBerry and iOS versions were developed and published by Hands-On Mobile..Mueller is co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Codagenix Inc., a New York-based biotechnology company engaged in the development of vaccines."
" I think that using computer is fine. Reason why I think you have family from far away. Instead of talking hearing voice on the phone. They can talk to each other but most of all see each other. Show cool thing you have that are new. When you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip. Computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car. You can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you. Also now you can buy food on internet and lots more. Saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money. Lots of dating sites to meet diffent people to go out and give your commets. Texting on facebook can let you save money by texting for free. Playing free online games with your friends. You can make website and you can watch movie and show online. There just a lot of thing you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside exercise but I agree with some expert. Lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. This techology people are big they don't go out more. They eat lots of food. But computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun.

"Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computer scientest have found cours for deseses, jobs have become easier and communication with friends or family have become afordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people on places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to phone without having to pay for anything. Is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could have them find afordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events. any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up and now computers can be as big as a flat screen @CAPS1 and you can turn them on with just a push of a button.

"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything.

Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously!

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about computers is that they benifet people. they help people when they need it, it gives people entertainment. So that is why computers benifet people. @CAPS1 first reason is that a computer can help people when they need help like for instace if you have to write a paper and you need to look something up such as reseach you can use the computer or if there is a long main cwayshion then you can look up the formula. So as you can see that is why computer benifts people @CAPS1 second resson is that it gives people entertainment, such as myspace, you twitter. And those are social networks, if you like to watch tv. or listen to music there are websites for them also. So that is why I said computers give you entertainmen too. @CAPS1 third resson is that it helps people such as if you in different contries and you can't go see them you to them through instans or web cam. Or if you are home schooled and you dnt see other kids your age that can talk to the on the computer. So as you can see that why I say you can through the computer. So as you can see that is why I say computer are very benifical be cause they give you entertainment they let you communicate and they help people so..Game Insight's portfolio includes more than 45 free-to-play games, including mobile games for Android, iOS, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Amazon, and games for social networks, such as Facebook and VKontakte, localized in 24 languages and played in 218 countries of the world..An example of an evolved antenna is an X-band antenna evolved for a 2006 NASA mission called Space Technology 5 (ST5)..The FCR is based on fully solid-state active phased array technology..From 1988 to 1992 he was a faculty member at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and also was a consultant for Qualcomm on CDMA technology..A platform (1936) (commonly called A-body) was a rear wheel drive automobile platform designation used by General Motors from at least 1936 until 1958, and again from 1964 to 1981..The A-side and B-side were used in the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam movie Love is the Pulse of the Stars, as opening and ending themes, respectively."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. ""You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond.

"Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming to dependant on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active. While some people @MONTH1 think were not wasting our time on the computer. I @CAPS3. I'll should only go on if it is nessesary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people dont realize is that is doesent only waste there time in waste our money too. Electricys bills are trough the roughtAlso instead og going out to meet @CAPS1 people are staying home and talking on social networking sites which make them less social. Children are not enrolling in sports which makes them losse any physical strength they would get. Also children could be getting over wait by just sitting there with no pysical activitys, @CAPS2 ideas like microsoft word is fine but going on every day for games is. Teachers, parent, and all need to show these that the computer is not the only thing, Computers can benifit us very well, by letting us have knoledge of somthing at the tip of our fingers. Computers can and will take away family and friend time. Now im not saying that computer but what am saying is that it effects everyone around you, @CAPS3 just the person thats using it. What @CAPS4 need to @CAPS3 is get together and unite. @CAPS4 need to go outside more, and exersise. @CAPS4 need to stop the computer with adults.

"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you know that eight out of ten homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. For others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. The computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a @NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, @ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw. So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curiouse about the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2, if I wanted more inofrmartion @CAPS3 head straight to the computer. You simply go to @ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty. The computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways, wether it is communication organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life. Computers don't just benifit our little town of @LOCATION1, they benifit our whole socoety in all of the amazing things they do. .The strategy was the result of a new technology, the helicopter, which resulted in a new form of warfare, the fielding of air cavalry, and was thought to be ideally suited to counter-guerrilla jungle warfare..It refers to the mobile phone being used outside the range of its home network and connects to another available cell network..The game was released on September 16, 2014 for Android mobile phones..She is as of 2015 Professor of Mobile Systems in the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, appointed October 2014, and Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge..Sinpar was a French automobile company which was founded in 1946 by Leon Demeester ..Variable displacement is an automobile engine technology that allows the engine displacement to change, usually by deactivating cylinders, for improved fuel economy."
"@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online..As years went by, other courses followed such as Bachelor in Elementary Education, B.S. in Secondary Education, BS in Information Technology, BS in Human Resource Management, BS in Entrepreneurship Management with Mary Jane Nicolas, Blandina Parada, Lilia Abella, Mr. Bernardo, Avelino Santos, and many more concerned officers, faculty and staff members: Claire Estanislao, Daniel Guevarra, Alberto Carasco, Aileen Quien, Rolando Cruz, Manuel Cachero, Leticia Bautista, Atty..The companies also planned to ultimately add two 500-megawatt coal gasification plants to the project as soon as such technology became commercially viable..In some countries, EMS messages cannot generally be sent between subscribers of different mobile phone carriers, as they will frequently be dropped by the inter-carrier network or by the receiving carrier..Choice graduated with a degree in History, Technology and Society in December 2007, and earned All-Big 12 Academic Honor Roll in 2004 along with All-ACC Academic Honor Roll in 2005-2006..Enterprise information management (EIM) is a field of interest within information technology..As the director of Necrosoft Games, Sheffield has created various games for PlayStation Mobile, including Gunsport and Oh Deer!."
"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend to much time on their computers. I belive people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death. First of all there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer to much. When they are out with their family they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a non-stop amount of time. In a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say, ""I had one child come into @CAPS3 office and he had the hardest time seeing"". He asked the kids mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, ""@CAPS3 son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses aare really expensive. I have read about children and adults deing from using the computer to much. They have fried their brain from using the computer to much. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking in homes, killing people, and high sacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside.

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us regularly? Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computer allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also website such as mapquest & yellowpages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleages instantly. What one does, is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are ease for our everyday life. So, don't spent your life on the computer but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine.

"Dear Newspaper, Advances in technology, while amazing, don't always have a positive effect on society. That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In @DATE1's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology is advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the @LOCATION1. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in @DATE1's world..Their technology was commercialized in the form of a flagship research tool, the BioRyx 200 optical trapping system..The Jordan Academy for Technology and Careers (often abbreviated to JATC), is the career and technical school owned and operated by the Jordan School District..This link between the phone and base station was carried over Bluetooth (BT Fusion was latterly available using Wifi technology, thus allowing discounts not only at home but over BT Openzone WiFi hotspots)..He is an authority on economics in relation to complexity theory, technology and financial markets..She was named one of MIT Technology Review's 35 Innovators Under 35 and has been interviewed or profiled by Fortune and the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy..An example would be a person of authority in a business organization sending out an email to five technicians in the information technology department of his company to let them know his printer is broken."
"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers. I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's to @PERSON2 who is our presiden now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing. They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it.

"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job.

"To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 concern, today people of all ages are useing computers. Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you @MONTH1 have needed to know. Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper. Teacher have troble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful. The near by libarry will always have extra computers students can use to write a papper. If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you @MONTH1 find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives. Some of these relatives @MONTH1 live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that home work. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information. Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there. By going on one of the search engines they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo. In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 & how it is in a @CAPS9.

"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?.The college emphasizes study through rigorous analysis and technology and the behaviors, institutions, and beliefs that constitute the human experience..Rocket Internet incubates and invests in internet and technology companies globally..Vinaphone is a Vietnamese major mobile network operator headquartered in Hanoi, Vietnam..She studied at ETSAV at the Polytechnic University of Valencia and at the Eindhoven University of Technology..His condition deteriorated dramatically while he was in hospital; having previously been living well with Alzheimers he became ""skeletal, incontinent, immobile, incoherent"" and needed 24-hour care..However, the technology at the time would not permit a show on the scale Disney wanted, and the Main Street extension proposal was abandoned (the presidential tribute was later built as The Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom)."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your motabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone. Even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights. Many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a survey an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and about an hour with family. The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind, ask your self how useful the computer really is. Sure it's good at researching things quickly but its also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glassses and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all..Perot Systems provided information technology services in the industries of health care, government, manufacturing, banking, insurance and others..A reduced version of the framework, the .NET Compact Framework, is available on Windows CE platforms, including Windows Mobile devices such as smartphones..Michael Elad (born December 10, 1963) is a professor of Computer-Science at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology..They included the Pope Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, the Electric Vehicle Company, and an entity of brief existence in 1899, the Columbia Automobile Company..The Camcon binary actuator is a digital valve device used by oil and gas operators and sold by Camcon Technology..North-Eastern Space Applications Center is a regional space center established in September, 2000 by joint initiative of Department of space, Government of India and North Eastern Council to expedite the usage of remote sensing technology to discover natural minerals uncovered in the North-Eastern states of India and to promote overall growth of North Eastern states of India using space science and technology."
"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more..The RSTS is similar in design to the Ballistic Missile Range Safety Technology (BMRST) operated at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida..Molex offers over 100,000 products, across a variety of industries: Aerospace & Defense, Automotive, Alternative Energies, Consumer/Home Appliances, Commercial Vehicles, Data/Computing, Industrial Automation, Industrial Electrical, Medical, Scientific, Smartphones and Mobile Devices, Solid State Lighting and Telecoms/Networking..Telemach is the third largest mobile operator in Slovenia with over 399,000 customers..The book received a positive reception, and was described by Technology Review as ""one of the first comprehensive reports on the upheavals underway in cyberspace."".The Food and Fertilizer Technology Center for the Asian and Pacific Region was established by treaty in Kawana, Japan on 11 June 1969..The Department of Science and Technology (DST) is the South African government department responsible for scientific research, including space programs."
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1! Get off that computer it is @TIME1. But mom I don’t want to im in the middle of a game. Does that conbersation sound familiar? Of course it does. Every kid likes to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer @NUM1 is not a good thing. In this matter experts are definatley @PERCENT1 right because kids and adults are spending too much time on the computer. These people can do other things like excersising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up. Every years my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dash, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to @DATE2 then my dad does another assment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excersises are bench pressing, squating, and dumbell curles. There are more challenging excersise but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that trainign and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrls to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excersise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their families insted of being on the computer @NUM1..Zeremes graduated from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in 2002 with a Bachelor of Arts in Acting..Mobile journalism is an emerging form of new media storytelling where reporters use portable electronic devices with network connectivity to gather, edit and distribute news from his or her community..Red Cedar Technology develops and distributes the HEEDS Professional suite of design optimization software..In the year 2010, there was a dramatic increase and prominence in the use of 3D-technology in filmmaking after the success of Avatar in the format, with releases such as Alice in Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, Jackass 3D, all animated films, with numerous other titles being released in 3D formats..Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology (MBCET), is an engineering educational institution located in Nalanchira, Trivandrum, Kerala, India offering engineering education and research..Ralink chipsets are used in various consumer-grade routers made by Gigabyte Technology, Linksys, D-Link, Asus and Belkin, as well as Wi-Fi adaptors for USB, PCI, ExpressCard, PC Cards and PCI Express interfaces."
"These have been many advancements on computer technology and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it. In against it and ill you why. You spend less time exercising which you'll gain weight. Spend less time enjoying nature which means youre lost with anything natural, an spend less time with friends and family which probbaly prove you, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 not saying the computer is a bad thing but to much of it certaintly is. First, you spend less time exercising. you don't exrcise you gain weight, you could do most of the stuff you could of , and you risk health. This is a bad thing because your not yourself anymore and if it goes to far you can't even a move. So if this sounds scary plan your time on the computer, so it doesn't happen to you, time is so limited that we waste it on stuff in computers so think before you go on the computer maybe you can go for a jog outside. Next, you spend less time playing nature. Nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing. There are only a few hundred maybe they said of us these truly help the environment, and if you think then few hundred of thousand people is alot . @NUM1.billion people of earth. Its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die, while most of us do nothing to help. Finaly, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most important reason of all. The main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world. Your friends important them. Your family might leave you if you your life to the computer if you they you so be carfully. Your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh. have good times and cheer you up when you upset. Just don't forget that as be gone. Well, there you have it my three reasons for being against work on the computer and they all sound like a good reasons so lets recap it all shall we. First, spend less time exersing, very important. Next spend less time enjoying nature, very important. Finaly less time with friends or family the most important of all. So hoped you enjoyed my essay and you've learned something .

"Dear editor, I have read your past article about how computers can take too much time out of some ones life! time they could be cseing to exercise or on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This is completly untrue and in many ways actually benerfits society. The internet is d fast d simple way to shorten the time spent doing activites we would already do. Instead of sending d letter to someone to invite them to the @CAPS3 you could just email them. Letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly. Also what if the movie sells out or is canceld, don't worry with the internet you can reschedele and buy tickets online. So that doesn't happen again. Suddenly your phone rings, its d call from your best friend saying to turn on the news, but you have to leave to pick up your kids in three minutes. Instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and , you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early. Have you been dieing to talk to someone haven't seenin a long time. Well with one of the many free websites like @CAPS4 and facebook go can do htat in d heart beat. You can talk to that person and find many race. Also if you've been feeling lonely, like you can't find the right person. With dating sites you can find the perfect person and maybe go to the @CAPS3 with them. Not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically. Acording to drishnig at @ORGANIZATION1 people who use computers for at least @NUM1 mintes a day have d @PERCENT1 increase in hand ey corodination relaction time and accuracy.

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think that computers have a positive or negative affect on people's lives? Well if you think it is negative I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand-eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. First, computers teach good hand-eye coordination. While you use computers you are improving your hand-eye coordination. One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger, you move the mouse and click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand-eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all. In fact the are the best bet for a better future..A mobile build was released in 2014 for Android and iOS..The book takes the reader in depth about rootkit technology and uses..The year 1555 CE in science and technology included a number of events, some of which are listed here..He also served in the White House Office of Management and Budget and worked as a management consultant focusing on strategy and technology issues for Fortune 500 US corporations..It houses a diverse collection of Oldsmobiles dating from 1897 to 2004..Mufakose Number 2 High School has produced a fair share of students who proceeded with further education and enrolled at University of Zimbabwe (UZ) and National University of Science and Technology (NUST)."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one? Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing..Mobile phones are ""considered hazardous waste"" in California; many chemicals in such phones leach from landfills into the groundwater system..He received both his Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Technology and Master's of Science degree in Education from The University of West Alabama..Mobile dating websites, in order to increase the opportunities for meeting, focus attention on users that share the same social network and proximity..His award was titled, ""First Place for Engineering Technology Advancement in Paving Materials."".The Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology (NEUST) (Filipino: Pamantasan ng Nueva Ecija sa Agham at Teknolohiya), is a university located in Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, Central Luzon, Philippines..The Society for Underwater Technology (SUT) is an international learned society of marine technology with headquarters in London, England that was founded in 1966."
"In my own opinion, computers are great addition to our world. Computers can help people with schoolwork, communication and entertain you in a safe way. Those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world. First of all, computers help with a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world-wide-web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can't find in books. In addition if a student forgets, losses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be @CAPS1 neat @CAPS1 possible. That is hard for some students,  typing it is neat, and everyone can do it. @CAPS1 you can see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are a great way to communicate and keep-in-touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send some thing to him, he could easily e-mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, the could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up an conference, the teacher could e-mail the parent a time and date. That is why computers are great can easy communication. Lastley, computers provide a safe, fun way or entertainment. Many companies make kid-friendly websites that  go on. For instance, my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kindergardeners who go on these websites, do better in first grade compared to those who don't computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide east communication, and provide safe educational activities, @CAPS1 you can see, computers are a great addition to our world..Sridhar Condoor, Ph.D., is the Chair of the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering department at Saint Louis University's Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology..In 1980, the HYCRUDE Corporation was established to commercialize the Hytort technology..HCL Technologies, an Indian technology company, was requested by News International on thirteen different occasions to delete large numbers of emails..After the games era he became specialized in network technology..Jesse N.

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, ect. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloose you to draw or biuld. I bet the even help young children became smarter by biulding things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad econimy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and bretheing you can find broken bones or tomors, you can biuld briges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most importen and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camra for or save a life by fing were they crased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter..It publishes original research papers and review articles on the application of molecular biology to biotechnology..A mobile laboratory is situated by the mud logging company near the drilling rig or on deck of an offshore drilling rig, or on a drill ship..Depending on usage and fittings, play busses may provide mobile playgrounds, gymnasiums, library services, or education centers as a mobile classroom..One serves US and other overseas Chinese communities through FM/AM and mobile apps..Virtual Intelligence Providers, L.L.C. is a Houston-based information technology and consulting company that specializes in ERP systems including SAP and Oracle training..Kiyoshi Ohishi from the Nagaoka University of Technology, Japan was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2015 for contributions to development of fast and robust motion control systems."
"I do not agree that computers benefits society. There are threes big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and arent spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people arent getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day. People would gain weight might ever get dabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten tov used to all the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk, with friends. People should al least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. So this is why I think this is bad for the societys benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart.

"Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. My neibor, who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. So I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad.That is why computers have a negative effect on our society..After considerable time and effort in the early and mid-2000s, SED efforts started winding down in 2009 as LCD became the dominant technology..IBM Linux Technology Center (LTC) is an organization focused on development for the Linux kernel and related open-source software projects..Areas of expertise: Income distribution and poverty - Labor markets - Industrial relations - Technology and productivity - Education - Wages - Unions and collective bargaining A nationally recognized economist, Mishel is frequently called on to testify and provide economic briefings to members of Congress and appears regularly as a commentator on the economy in print and broadcast media. ....A derivative version of CAB exists in both the Web Client and Mobile Client Software Factories as well..Naval Mobile Construction Battalion FOUR (NMCB 4) is a Navy Seabee battalion based out of Port Hueneme, California..The Miniature Acoustic Warning System (MAWS) is a mobile UTAMS in a smaller package."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you dont even need a keyboard. Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. We'll computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the vireses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parcore. Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They to, might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a buisness that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more.If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us suesede is great..The company has launched mobile and Mac apps such as Briefs and TouchPad..The benefit of adding a search layer to the architecture stack is rapid response time large dynamic datasets made possible by search indexing technology such as an inverted index..The college is home to the Lyndon P.

"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise.

"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say @CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11.

"The computer is a great achivement of man. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other capabilities. Even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world. It has negatively afect to people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Along with that they are being socialy active. The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people. It would be great if some how the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should wont to get out and interact. Take a walk.

"Have you ever had a computer? I'm sure if you was around my age you know how fun it is to explore the internet. It's a brain tht gives you information about everything. But, it’s not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer. Things like exercise, socializing and homework matter. If you don't exercise you begin to gain weight, if you don't socialize you'll be an lonely person. Homework is the most important, because it'll help you really well through life. It's fine to go on the computer time to time, but not for hours. Exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports, you should jog a couple times of day. Some people make you feel bad if your bigger than they are. For example, I knew someone who was a little big for his age, but people didn't like him and they always made fun of him. I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer. Do you have ant friends? Or did all of them leave you because you wouldn't stop surfinh the web on your computer. As a teenager you should be socializing with your friend at the movies, arcaded and parties. Not in the house on the computer. Especially with your family, because you never know if they're going shopping for you ask me that's selfishness. Every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades? Education is the most important thing you need in your life. Without it you can't be or do anthing, because you wouldn't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job how can you pay for electrity bill for your computer? Education can get anywhere, if you want it. If not you can be a homeless guy in the street holding a computer that doesn't work. Do you still think this has a positive effect on people? You should talk to parents about getting their child an computer. For example, tell the parent to put a password that only she/he knows, that way he has to ask you to sign onto it everytime we needs it. Blocks off things that you think is important for your child., especially if your child is into sex. That is why I don't think it gives people the right kind effect they might need..He worked as an accountant and as an economics tutor at Melbourne University and the Swinburne and Chisholm Institutes of Technology..The cash security system that is based on identifiable banknotes, was invented and first introduced in 2014 by AI-specialized British-Austrian technology company EDAQS..Glooko, Inc provides a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application and accompanying mobile app for diabetes patients and their healthcare providers in the United States and internationally..The project's aim was to build a medium tank with heavier armor, but German advances in tank technology proved better countered by a more heavily armed T-34-85 and the T-43 was canceled..From the Middle Ages until World War II, coastal artillery and naval artillery in the form of cannon were highly important to military affairs and generally represented the areas of highest technology and capital cost among materiel..Recent findings on new products developed via chemical nanotechnology are also included."
"Dear editor I agree that people do spend to much time on their computers. An if you read this you would see my reasons why. One of them will be about exercising. The two others will be about your friends and family. So read my reasons and by the end I hope I made my point. All right like I said first we will talk about what the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer. Did you know that from being on the computer all the time you lose focus on exercising anymore? Of you eating an @CAPS1 not exercising, because your worried about the computer. The weight that you put on you know just doesn't burn off by themselves. So by you not burning off that fat you just keep gaining and gaining. By the time you know it you'll be over weigh and wish you didn't spend all that time on that computer. How that I'm explaining about your of exercise. Where going to talk about your you bring on the computer all you would with your family. For example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer @CAPS1 parents would @CAPS1 they would because your lack of communication with the family. I've got my two reasons across let me get my third. Of you bing on that computer you have been adicted, but you just don't lose contact with family, but also with friends. You loving that computer so much you probably quite all your like the basketball, softball, and more teams because you thought it took to much of your computer time. In the end you would lose probably alot of frienships. @CAPS1 your boyfriend or girlfriend would dump you. So now that you read this I hope I got my point out to you, about what a computer can do to you in the end..It will also provide some breathing room for the controversial Net neutrality that has been the central issue between mobile carriers, like AT&T, Verizon and Sprint Nextel, and web media moguls, like eBay, Amazon.com and Google..Committed to simplifying technology, Karbonn has made inroads in the market with a combination of affordable yet innovative devices..An extender, also known as a filler, in printing ink technology is a white transparent, or semi-transparent, component whose purpose is to reduce the cost of the ink, by increasing the area covered by a given weight of pigment..Shailesh J.

"Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people not great but its good for many reasons, for now I have three reason why its good, my reasons are, search new places meet new people, when people have nothing to do, and teenagers that cant be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they dont have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they dont have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also thre are many websites of movies. My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer. teenagers are teenagers they must have technology. If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop. This is my opion on the effects computers have on people..The Museum's director is the internationally published technology journalist Alex Handy, with Dr. Henry Lowood, Curator of Stanford University History of Science & Technology Collections and Film & Media Collections serving on the board of directors..CBQ is a traffic management algorithm developed by the Network Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as an alternative to traditional router-based technology..Google developed its Android operating system atop the Java language, including its APIs and a cleanroom version of the standard implementation, to build its own mobile device platform..Without DTM, the mobile device must be capable of reception and transmission simultaneously (full-duplex) requiring complex and expensive circuitry in the mobile terminal..The technology provided a mechanism by which Pay TV broadcasters could restrict their services to subscribers and proved to be of great value to Murdoch's growing media interests..Since 1968, the company has been in industrial signal interface technology."
"To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need..In 1970, Young joined the band TW4 while a student at Illinois Institute of Technology, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering..These alerts and messages are then received on ALERT FM receivers (mobile, wall mounted, or USB) or on cell phones equipped with active FM chips and properly installed software..In contrast to traditional mechanical converting, laser digital converting utilizes the features of lasers and advance software technology to convert parts in extremely high accuracy..McLean is known for her live performances, versatile and distinct singing voice, cross-genre songwriting style and use of live looping technology..The NAPS-Z technology, introduced in 1978, was developed with assistance from Hitachi..MyBroadband is the largest IT website in South Africa, serving the local market with technology and business news, and hosts the largest online community in the country in the form of its forum."
"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today..It is the interface between the mobile station (MS) and the Base transceiver station (BTS)..Viola Ventures is focused on early stage companies in the fields of enterprise infrastructure and applications, frontier and deep technologies (automotive, IOT, AR/VR, drones), software, software as a service, financial technology, Internet, media, communications, semiconductors, and consumer electronics..He is the McCormick Tribune Professor of Technology at the Kellogg School of Management..The Indian Institute of Technology Jammu (abbreviated IIT Jammu) is a public research university located in Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India..EECS builds upon the concept proposed by the Basic Commitment of the Renewable Energy Certificate System (RECS) and now supports all types of electricity, regardless of source or production technology..Linda Ham was the Constellation Program Transition and Technology Infusion Manager at NASA."
"Dear @CAPS1 of my local news paper: @CAPS2 you believe this garbage that the so called expert are saying about computers? I sure hope you don't! They are saying that computers are health risks because to many people are on them and not exercising, well if you risk me the users should know when to stop. And well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits. Also computers are very convient, if you need information on a topic right away. So there far I think computers are not the one's at, in this perdevment. Exercising is somthing a perosn should have the ambition to do. @MONTH1 people don't have this they spend their day on the computer. they claim its not their faut. the computer is a you to play it. I read just last week that someone actolly told her press they it is not fault her over weight. Thats ! So the only person at full. for not getting the the gamer. As us family interaction goes, all up to the parents the use the parents are in control over they child and if they are that their kid doesn't spend enough time. The operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits!. If we didn't have computers at home it would be a. Kids relie on computer them quick, accurate information. With not them the parents should their child to and from the library, and the time. And lets not forget the internet easy. So in conclusion computers are the way to go they are not the cause or however luck of exrcising at fault. Its not the computers fault familys. And they are just so convenit so clearly computer are good to have! I truly hope by the letter you agree with my oppinion..Blakely Island is located just off the docks of Mobile between the city and Old Spanish Fort located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay..It currently offers two mobile apps for Android and iPhone users as well as web-based platform..Montecarlo Automobile is a car manufacturer which is based at Montecarlo in Monaco and the company has specialized and produced several exotic and handmade racing and street legal sports cars, it was founded in 1983 by the engineer Fulvio Maria Ballabio who has raced in the IndyCar Series and Offshore..In information technology, benchmarking of computer security requires measurements for comparing both different IT systems and single IT systems in dedicated situations..Ghaani appeared in many advertisements like Big Bazar Badal Dalo, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Star Plus on Mobile etc..Houseparty is a social networking service that enables group video chatting through mobile and desktop apps."
"Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors..In 2011, Incinerator launched a new company, Playdek, focused on developing mobile tabletop games..The game uses a variety of motions enabled by mobile device touchscreens to simulate actions in real life, such as looking around the device, turning keys, and activating switches..The liberalization of Bangladesh's telecommunications sector began with small steps in 1989 with the issuance of a license to a private operator for the provision of inter alia cellular mobile services to compete with Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB), the previous monopoly provider of telecommunications services within Bangladesh..The technology used to mark an item is 2D Data Matrix ECC 200 Symbol..Not only does NTI supply the people, but the call center technology as well..Its design is a combination of a high-technology theme and the use of contemporary and traditional motifs."

"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the computeres have on people. In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs. Computure or a prime source of the data base, of @CAPS4, criminal records and so much more. With out computures how could catch the bad guy or catch the cancer before it's too late. Computure are key in many things. in the end you could go all day about the pros & cons of computures. But there so key in major aspects today, the pros out weigh the cons..They must therefore be distinguished from strategies that are specific to a particular field of study (e.g. music or technology), and from abilities inherent in the student, such as aspects of intelligence or learning styles..It was developed by French team cTools Studio for the mobile platforms and ported by Neko Entertainment for the rest..The interactive content can be downloadable or accessed online on computers and mobile devices..Prior to OWIN, Microsoft's ASP.NET technology was designed on top of IIS, and Web applications could not easily be run on another Web server (although note that despite this the Mono community developed several ASP.NET compatible Web servers, such as XSP)..The Restricted Enforcement Unit (REU) is an expert-level committee set up in 1987 by the British government to control exports of military technology from the United Kingdom, in particular the illegal export or trade of conventional weaponry and weapons of mass destruction not licensed for export by the Department of Trade and Industry..This has also been fueled by the impact various conflicts of interests can have on commercialization when biotechnology organizations contract services from academic institutions or government scientistsThis is exemplified by the successful emergence of a large number of consulting companies dedicated exclusively to servicing the biotech industry."
"Dear editor, I think that computers are a good thing to have in the house. They're very helpful and entertaining. For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. ""I love facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have facebook, skype, or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. ""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com,"" says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll. I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @CAPS1 everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is one of the most important things in the average home..In March 2015, GE Ventures led a Series A investment in Evidation Health, a healthcare technology company formerly known as The Activity Exchange that is involved in data analytics..Primarily, high-quality music is made available to purchase, access and play back using software on the Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, set-top boxes and mobile devices from an available distribution point, such as a computer host or server located at a telephone, cable TV or wireless data center facility..Francis chose his hometown of Pittsburgh for the setting because it has a large tech community, over 1,600 tech-based companies and the Carnegie Institute of Technology is ranked among the top five engineering colleges in the country by the U.S. News & World Report..Gates received a $2.5 million advance for his book and money from subsidiary rights sales; all his proceeds were donated to ""encourage the use of technology in education administered through the National Foundation for the Improvement of Education,"" a foundation created by the National Education Association..All the vans are self-sufficient mobile tire fitting centers equipped with a compressor, tire fitting machine, electronic wheel balancer, several vehicle jacks and all the tools of the trade required to do the job..Virk was moved from Advanced Education to Technology, Innovation and Citizens' Services on the same day the revised report was released."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever trully marveles at the computers in our generation today? Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someonehas? Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children. In order to help the wee-being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours! This pretty much takes up a lot of time, so families can't spend time with one another. One important problem that children and teens face are @CAPS2 oover the intenet are people known as ""child predators."" @CAPS4 people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter @CAPS4 ""child predators; would you want to see your child be hurt by @CAPS4 horrible people? Computers are the reason, a with the internet for @CAPS4 accurances. Children and teens need to be protected from this major threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and thier lives. First, they don't allow people to be active and go outside. .A8 is used to generate the session key used by A5 to encrypt the data transmitted between the mobile station and the BTS..Mobile Panic is a term developed to explain mobile media and communication crisis..Fibre satellite distribution is a technology that enables satellite TV signals from an antenna to be distributed using an optical fiber cable infrastructure and then converted to electrical signals for use with conventional set-top box receivers..Published by ImpreMedia, the paper covers local, national and international news with an emphasis on Latin America, as well as human-interest stories, politics, business and technology, health, entertainment, and sports..He then ran fourteen races in 1990 in the #47 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme for Close Racing, he led in the 1990 Daytona 500 at one point with leading 6 laps in that race..A port for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile, titled Cytus: Lambda, was released on June 26, 2013."
"Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing..In Canada, it was marketed as both the Vauxhall Victor (sold through Pontiac/Buick dealerships) and the Envoy (through Chevrolet/Oldsmobile dealers)..Humanity has used animal hides since the Paleolithic, for clothing as well as mobile shelters such as tipis and wigwams, and household items..She currently serves as the Ramanujan Faculty Fellow at the Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology, in Trivandrum, India, and Senior Research Officer at Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Darlinghurst, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia..Galleon (Galleon: Islands of Mystery in the U.S. version) is an action-adventure game that was developed by Toby Gard and Confounding Factor, and released by SCi Games and Atlus for the Xbox and mobile phones..A subsidiary of Temasek Holdings, the funds focus on venture capital investment opportunities in the information technology and healthcare markets through its global family of direct investment venture funds..Original work was done on the program by AudioFile, a company that specialized in computer-based voice technology."
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to @CAPS2.com and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in @LOCATION1 then all this @CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'@CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'@CAPS3 do none of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people..The Civic Center (capacity: 10,112) was a hub of activity in early 2000s, as it also hosted the ECHL's Mobile Mysticks and the NBDL's Mobile Revelers..The company was founded based on the work of plasma physics professor Nikolay Suslov, who developed a technology to apply plasma energy to surgically treat live tissue with minimal thermal damage..Its current editors-in-chief are Suzanne Flynn (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Klaus Abels (University College London)..QQlive is a live streaming video freeware created by Tencent, which takes advantages of advanced P2P streaming media technology to ensure that the platform can keep up with traffic..GE Marc V is a historic U.S. format or protocol of trunked, two-way radio introduced by General Electric Mobile Radio in the early 1980s..Reddick also produces comics and cartoons regularly for magazines like Star Trek Magazine, Knights of the Dinner Table, Renaissance Magazine, Nickelodeon and Scholastic's The New York Times Upfront, and has created comic book work for IDW Publishing and Tokyopop, has created product designs for various companies like Paramount Pictures, CBS Studios, Roddenberry Productions, Canson, Inc. and the NCAA, has created mobile content for providers like CBSMobile and ROK Media in the UK, and his abstract and pop art paintings have been exhibited in galleries and museums in Indianapolis, Florida, Michigan, England and France, and he has painted wall murals in Japan."
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, ""@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends..Building Giants documents significant architecture and design from across the world and features articles on current practice, building technology, interior designs and social issues affecting architecture..With the release of software build 1.6 on January 8, 2014, Oxwall officially announced the support of its in-house Mobile Browser Version, optimized for performance in major mobile browsers currently available on the market..The year 1937 in science and technology involved some significant events, listed below..CBS Sports was honored at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media Technology for Synchronous Enhancement of Original Television Content for Interactive Use for its program March Madness on Demand..Neustar, Inc. is an American technology company that provides real-time information and analytics for the Internet, risk, digital performance and defense, telecommunications, entertainment, and marketing industries, and also provides clearinghouse and directory services to the global communications and Internet industries..OpenKeychain is a free and open-source mobile app for the Android operating system that provides strong, user-based encryption which is compatible with the OpenPGP standard."
"Dear, @CAPS1-@ORGANIZATION1 Computers... they are sometimes bad and sometimes good they're like people. Computers are helpful on finding information, making your work less difficult. But at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family. Computers have so much information that the news paper in the future will no longer be known. Newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch. Because of computers instead of getting info of what happen yesterday in what area you live with the computer you can find out what intersting things happen yesterday in the whole world. But thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project. About as an example cells and with that computer it will help a lot more than you think no need to write all slopy just type of cell's were you can find in the internet, print done it just makes life way easier than just writing drawing finding info of cells in book that waste good time to go outside and play with friends and family. Computer like I said are sometimes bad like people and it also like a drug. Because look at computers when people go on website like, myspace, twitter, facebook, communicating website or game website, theres whay to much to name. Its a drug cause you to stay on it day to night you'll get stuck to it and can't get enough of it and some people won't stop and it hurts there family, friend and especially health, like drugs they cause all the same thing. I think I proved my point of why computers are sometimes bad and sometimes good like people..Small drug molecules, biotechnology products including genes, peptides, proteins and vaccines, and genetically engineered cells are an integral part of papers published..The exception to this was Dublin Institute of Technology which emerged independently of the Regional College system..The EP consists of 6 remixes of songs from his 2003 album Emotional Technology..Train and equip a large, mobile squad of police, ready to employ riot tactics in order to uphold the law against violent picketing..The polytechnic education focus in programs in the fields of education, management, technology, health and agriculture, although programs in other fields, like arts, sports, journalism, tourism and nautical science also exist..Saeed Badhrees is a research scientist in experimental particle physics at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) and a Distinguished Fellow of New Westminster College."
"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society. I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today over use that power. You know what I mean @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts. Or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. People like the @CAPS4 do not spend much time with family members, or friends, or even just outside. They do not get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, physically or socially. Some people are working all day, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so that they rarely spend time with those they love. But if you are hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @MONTH1 just not spend enough time with family and friends. Using a computer isn't exactly a social thing. One person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. You @MONTH1 say ""@CAPS5, but there are also online social networks."" @CAPS5, but how often do you even see those people in real life? Computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. That certainly does not benefit society. A major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors. So you cannot be online chatting, or playing a game, or checking your email, outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. Sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors? Computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not well. That is the reason why pine tree's don't have outlets (although now you never know what they'll do next). Another side effect - that goes allong with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise. Once again, it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. When you live as a computer vegetable, your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be. Another reason computers could lower your quality of life. Now, really, if you use the computer sparingly, and only when you needed to, or when it is nessecary you would really have none at these ""side effects."" But face it, the ruth is, computers can be addicting. Wether it's waiting for a friend to come online or your trying to get to level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"", they can get you hooked. The idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers, but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting-springly. So, now you know, computers when used to much, at obsesive amounts, are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting. As long as you use them correctly, they are a very, very valuable tool to be used, but over used, can be problem causing, and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends, getting exercise and even spending time outdoors. I know you certainly will agree..Mobile Signature Service (MSS) is a high-level service specified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute that defines the roles participating in mobile identity management and mobile signature transactions, as well as functional and business-related requirements and interfaces..A SIM lock, simlock, network lock, carrier lock or (master) subsidy lock is a technical restriction built into GSM and CDMA mobile phones by mobile phone manufacturers for use by service providers to restrict the use of these phones to specific countries and/or networks..Cherrybrook Technology High School is a purpose built Technology High School located at 28 - 44 Purchase Road, Cherrybrook NSW, Australia..Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203) is an automobile which was produced by German manufacturer Mercedes-Benz from July 2000 to December 2006..The company developed a number of Internet interests including Altnet, a joint venture with Joltid Ltd., to develop and market secure distributed storage for content using P2P technology to reduce distribution costs and reach new audiences..She was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2008."
"I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. Therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. For example me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. If we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. Plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. My where you add up and subtract and divide.

"Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts.

"Dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are good to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in other places or with your family or friends or meet with people from other country and you can become frinds. They are also good because they help to develop cordination on your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. First of all I think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other county or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. You can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls. Secondly the computers are helpful because they help you cordinate your hand and your eye. This helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; You will be able to finish it on time. From your point of view you can actually se were I'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. The hand cordination can help you develop mentally sight. Thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy thing like a clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online. In conclusion I think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to cordinate body parts don't you agree with me?.The year 1992 in science and technology involved many significant events, some listed below..On 15 October 2002 he became Minister of Science, Technology and Tertiary Education, stepping down on 9 November 2003 to become Minister of Legal Affairs a day later..The material was announced in Nature by investigators from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all in the United States..Technology analyst Om Malik wrote in May 1998 how Starlight software helped power Bloomberg Television and Starlight partnered with RealNetworks to enable Web conferencing at Smith Barney..The plot revolves around biotechnology researcher Kal Morrow and his son Saul..Currently serving as a senior fellow and director of Economics21 at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research and as an adjunct professor of economics at George Washington University, she has been nominated by President Donald Trump to become Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Research and Technology."
"To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously needed in society. They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. Our teacher also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research. For example, last week in social students I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to @ORGANIZATION1- on the and sound a storage of information on the @NUM1 for my project on wehter capital punishment is and unusual. I found from this database that not onlt is it all lawed for that reason but the @LOCATION1 got from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which is instanly to carry the newest. most recent information I would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact. It would mre costly taken over two houses just to find the same information that five minutes using a computer. The internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method. As well as for research, school use computers to type papers. This moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check. Also, using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers. E-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are just @NUM2 of the commnly used websites on computers they make talking to friends and family easier and faster then ever. Last @DATE1 my friend on a business trip the was for @NUM3 weeks she missed him a lot @CAPS4 mom let @CAPS4 she was able to would have a telephone call. It consoled @CAPS4 for the @NUM4 days wasn't able to see @CAPS4 while still being amazing quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before. It is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them we don't need to worry about learning in life. Also in the closer future computer will be used in high school and college for helping paper researching and morw it will be faster and easier for us it we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventualy if can read the benefits are counters. As you can see, computers and the internet can any benefits iur society school can use them for many projects and learning People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face to face finally, it can help run the future.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 editor, I have recently seen on the channel @NUM1 news that you want to know about the. Computers have on people. In the past, everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 agree computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination. Dr. @DR1 expert in relationship to humans said, ""People without computers cant do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination. The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. when you can't look up and learn about places, you are not about them. You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friend ships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you. .Offroad Legends is a series of racing video games which utilize pseudo-3D graphics released initially in 2012 for mobile platforms..He was also founder, chairman and CEO of Braintree, a company which specializes in mobile and web payment systems for ecommerce companies..After postdoctoral research at the California Institute of Technology, she joined the Rice University department of Computational and Applied Mathematics in 1996, and became the Noah Harding Professor at Rice in 2007..The Wireless Application Service Provider's Association is an industry body for South African companies in the mobile services industry..Pandjaitan is also chairman of the DEL Foundation, which has created schools including a technology college for underprivileged students, a bilingual high school for gifted children, a kindergarten and an elementary school..Sega started a cell-phone service featuring Sonic the Hedgehog characters in Japan in 2000, called Sonic Cafe, and established a mobile division, Sega Mobile, in 2003."
"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom @PERSON1 was a size six in the waist. @PERSON1 would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. @PERSON1 quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (computer game) and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. @PERSON1 is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad @PERSON4. When @PERSON4 gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, @PERSON3 became a member of @CAPS4 @CAPS2, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when @PERSON3 was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, @CAPS7 take my suggestion seriously and bann computers..Typically this is hidden from the user as an internal part of a mobile app..It has been used to understand human behavior toward technology in various contexts, such as: education, knowledge transfer, communication in virtual environments, e-negotiation, business process improvement, trust and leadership in virtual teamwork, online learning, maintenance of distributed relationships, performance in experimental tasks using various media, and modular production..Conscious evolution refers to the ability of the human species to choose what the species Homo sapiens becomes in the future, based on recent advancements in science, medicine, technology, psychology, sociology, and spirituality..Sony Pictures Mobile is a division of Sony Pictures Digital and a Sony Pictures Entertainment company..Energy technology is an interdisciplinary engineering science having to do with the efficient, safe, environmentally friendly and economical extraction, conversion, transportation, storage and use of energy, targeted towards yielding high efficiency whilst skirting side effects on humans, nature and the environment..Thornton v.

"Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs @NUM1 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer @NUM2 its bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go me go on the computer, but she @CAPS1 makes me go outside and run around @CAPS1 people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger chilld the wrong ideas. For example I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad peole post videos and the little children could see then and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time and with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad..The John W.

"New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers is a benefit to society. Most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them. No matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eys off the screen. Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isnt' all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicans put together. If you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plety of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing whats going on. Do you like to stay organizes I personally, think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people need the computer to do their job and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working humans is a larger amount. So, thing about it, if computers weren't made, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would not have, jobs, or they would have to keep everything down on paper which @MONTH1 be a catastrophe. After a while, you @MONTH1 want to back everything up by copying all of your photos, files, music ect. to a @CAPS4 so you dont loose everything if your computer shuts down. After reading this, don't you agree with me, that computers are a benefit to society? There are many more reasons but this paper had alot. I hope you have realized that without computers, the world wouldn't be as it is today. Thank you for your time. .According to the researchers at the Citizen Lab, the International Computer Science Institute, and Princeton University's Center for Information Technology Policy, who coined the term, the Great Cannon hijacks foreign web traffic intended for Chinese websites and re-purposes them to flood targeted web servers with enormous amounts of traffic in an attempt to disrupt their operations..The Sony Ericsson W902 is a mobile phone and part of the Walkman series of phones..Wheatley has a technology magnet program inherited from the closure of Middle College for Technology Careers in spring 2006; Wheatley's program began in fall 2006..Other research funded by U.S. federal agencies have led to widely used technologies such as laser technology, the internet, fiber optics, the Global Positioning System, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computer touch screens and lithium-ion batteries..Streamlight developed a handheld 1 million candlepower (981,000 candela) searchlight as a commercial spin-off of technology developed by Johnson Space Center for NASA as part of the Apollo program..On occasion, a special mini-documentary segment, In the Future, would be presented, examining events and technology that may exist in the near future."
"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? Of course you @CAPS1, that's where you get all the information you need. Computers are good and everyone should have one. The computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know. It also lets you communicate with your family, friends, or other people you need to communicate with. It can also let you see disasters in other countries and teach you about the world. Computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways. Computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know. If you're in school and you need to @CAPS1 research, well there you go, you have a computer to help you. This is also good for jobs. Any one can use them and learn new things at the same time. It let's you @CAPS1 work, learn new things, and it's fast and easy to @CAPS1. You don't have to @CAPS1 all that hard work of looking for a book and spending so much time looking for the information you need. Computers are great and you should use it. Another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them. If you have family or friends that live far away or in another country, then you can communicate them by computers. You can easily webcam with them or e-mail. This is very easy and this way you can stay close to them. This is also good if you @CAPS1 business online. You can @CAPS1 your job and talk to the people you need to talk to. If you ever have to arrange on emergency meeting and don't have time to call the people you need to, then simply send them an e-mail and your set for the meeting the next day and so are they. This is a perfect way for communication and business. My final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and you really wanted to see them, then you can go on your computer and see the news and learn new things and see what bad things have happened. Also if you live some where that isn't your home town, then you can go online and see what is going on at your hometown and visit for any special occassions. You can learn a lot of new things about other countries. Also you can learn about new places if you ever want to move to another country. You can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation. This is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places. In conclusion to all of my facts, computers are good. It lets you learn new things and @CAPS1 research. Also, it lets you communicate with family, of friends in case of emergencies. Computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries. If you have a computer, then that is great.

"Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves.

"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work. Overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer. But, some times it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1. Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line. Also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @CAPS1. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @CAPS3 be bullyed at their safe place, their home. Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise. A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said ""every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers."" @CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. Lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students. Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend to much time all the computer. I was waching discovery chanel and it said that @CAPS3 most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework. The computer made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!.The institute is approved by Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India as Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (SIRO)..Its science and technology is in the public domain..The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 2013..The game was designed by Greg Johnson to make use of an animation engine technology called DinoMorph developed at the University of Oregon..His latest book Hitler's Terror Weapons details the development of secret technology under the Third Reich, and was published in Great Britain in 2002, printed by CPI UK..Viewers can access Hits through mobile platforms for simulcast and catch-up."
"Dear @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I understand you think computers don’t have an effect on people. Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for.

"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention! They allow you to do so many different things. They have alot of positive effects on people. Computers deal with all sorts of things, from hand-eye cordination, learning about faraway places and people, to talking online with anyone. Come on in to the wonderful world of computers. Computers have a super positive effect on people. They help teach hand eye cordination. You can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse.

"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in would floor.

"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has made great improvements in the past years. Computers have now found a home in all most every buisness and home in @LOCATION1! Everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined and peole should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning? Name the fatest country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? The answer to all @ORGANIZATION1 those questions is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies done by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. @ORGANIZATION1 those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are over weight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function and helps burn off unnessecary calories. People most definately need to get off the computer and exercise more. They might even like it. Spending time with your family can be great fun, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school,"" @CAPS4 @PERSON2 beyond. So what's stopping them?, Computers. Kids now find many internet sites online online more interesting than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn @ORGANIZATION1 the computers, bring out the board games and keep @CAPS5 families together! ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have,"" @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS6 wasting money on? You guessed it; computers. The average bill per month is @MONEY2. In a whole year your paying @MONEY1 for something you don't need! Computers also waste space. Along with needing a place to house your monitor, you have to find room to cram a printer, the hardrive AND all those wires. Who can find enough room?! I certainly can't. Although technology, namely computers, can be a wonderful thing, we need to look at the downside. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart and the economy collapses, all because @ORGANIZATION1 computers.

"Dear @CAPS1, I belive that computers benefits the people of today. The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had recived information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to comunicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remeber my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the . Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2-obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and excersising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they myt entertain themselves indeers. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privleges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormouse benifits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students whith school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside.

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone..The United States accounted for 34% of the units and Europe for 26%.It is considered to be the successor to the F1, utilizing hybrid power and Formula 1 technology, but does not have the same three-seat layout as its predecessor..MultiSync is a free synchronization tool to synchronize PDAs, mobile telephones, and personal information manager software with each other..The company provides automation technology to restaurants and also operates its own restaurants..There are also smaller mobile cinemas employing digital projection technology..The project, which was started by the Veer Shromani Maharana Pratap Samiti, aims at providing information about Maharana Pratap and the historical heritage of the area with the help of modern technology..A nitrogen oxide sensor or NOx sensor is typically a high-temperature device built to detect nitrogen oxides in combustion environments such as an automobile or truck tailpipe or a smokestack."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers do benefit society because computers can do alot of things like teach you. Computers are very helpful now, mostly every thing gets done on it. The computer teaches good eye cordination, how to focus, and show you stuff you don't know about. Without an computer you really can't get any thing done or reddy. A computer can be helpful for lots of things like job aplications of taxe's, or at a grocry store register, typeing and being on the computer is exercising but not for your body. When your on a computer exercise your hand's and your brains. With out computers you really cant do any thing. Mostly everything you do in life have to deal with some type of computer. I think that the people that said they shouldnt be on the computer is wrong because they can interact with there family that's far away thats also on the. You can enjoy nature by just takeing a look old you don't have to walkt out. Thats why I think computers are positive and helpful..Dr. Winston received a BA in Biology from the University of Chicago in 1974 and a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1980, where he conducted research with Dr. David Botstein on phage P22 lysogenization..The fourth technology is the matrix array transducer that uses beamsteering to sample points throughout a pyramid shaped volume..When residents or visitors connect to beacons via their smartphone and other mobile devices they can access web pages and real-time information that is relevant to news, events, and business relevant to their specific locations..St David's School was a Roman Catholic Technology College in Acklam, Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England, specializing in Mathematics, Science, Technology (cooking, textiles, electronics & wood work) and ICT..The National Institute of Fire Technology is based in Islamabad and is affiliated with the Directorate of Civil Defense of the Ministry of Interior..Alfred is a free mobile app that turns Android and iOS devices into home security cameras."
"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefits the society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and it teaches people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world throughout everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the @LOCATION1 has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school I know that from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study in a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer know that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That's because with all the and websites it will teach us hand-eye coordination with I'm just having fun. Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy to use it. That's ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, than nothing does. As I have shown, computers deffinitly do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because it gives people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand-eye coordination.

"Click click, another information page opens up on your handy @LOCATION4 these trusty, smart, and easy to use divices are always a object to have. Although, people are now starting that these handy desktops are bad for your well-being oposing that people strongly think that we dont get enough exercise or outdoor activitys in. Well computers are such a great entertainment system also, have a vast information supplie, and even allow socialization with friends/ family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 payers are no match for the internet and it's great wide spread entertainment system. The computer has all of the faimly fun movies, itunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse. The internet is the obvious best reason for a faimly movie night. One of the greatest pro about the internet is the vividsorce of information. Google, wikipedia, or even dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the @DATE1. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun I would rather learn about a sunny beach of @CAPS2 or the great landscape of @LOCATION1. If your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the @CAPS3 is a sure easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in @LOCATION2 or germany. The answer is simple, skype, fiacebook, myspace and more are all available on your handy @CAPS3. Many sites have a no fee polocy so they cant charge them money for social living with friends. As a personal experience I could now talk to my cousins wqho live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 due to the great interaction site of facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that thier even there. Obviously internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends. I'm people will open thier eyes see the great uses of the computer..Contestants participate by Skype from the comfort of their own home, an inexpensive technology negating the need for travel expenses..The album was, in part, recorded to showcase RCA Victor's new Living Stereo recording process and test the limits of the new technology..Because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and lack of recurring costs, biosand filters are often considered appropriate technology in developing countries..Its shows are distributed in over forty countries, on the Internet, mobile phones, and linear television platforms..University Park at MIT is a mixed-use urban renewal project in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, occupying land near Central Square between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus and the primarily residential neighborhood of Cambridgeport..The company was launched by Virgin Group in 1999 as the world's first Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO)."
"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community..The Toledo Complex is an automobile factory in Toledo, Ohio..The increasing use of horticulture and the development of the Eastern Agricultural Complex, consisting of weedy seed plants as well as gourd cultivation, also meant that groups became less mobile over time and, in some times and places, people lived in permanently occupied villages and cities..The company's main specialities are: Mobile Robotics Products (mobile robots and mobile manipulators)..In 1996 the technology started showing up on select models of Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles..The network can be that of any of the wireless communication technologies like GSM, CDMA, wireless local loop, Wi-Fi, WiMAX or other wide area network (WAN) technology..His editorial responsibilities range from business and finance to science, technology and innovation."
"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1's small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more conected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as uch as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one..The company targets specific industries in its portfolio of holdings, particularly focusing on technology, real estate, healthcare, security, small business, golf finance, and equipment leasing companies..The film was also later dubbed in Hindi as Mr. Mobile by Goldmines Telefilms in 2014 with Manoj Manchu's voice dubbed by Amar Babaria..The software uses Apple Computer's QuickTime VR, a technology which enables users to view every side of 3D rendered objects, and includes a virtual tour given by Jonathan Frakes (in his role as William Riker from the TV series)..Lala Lajpat Rai Institute of Engineering and Technology, Moga (commonly known as LLRIET) is in the city Moga of the Indian state of Punjab..The Bionic was modeled after a type of fish, the yellow boxfish, Ostracion cubicus, and also has 80% lower nitrogen oxide emissions with its selective catalytic reduction technology..Technogaians argue that developing safe, clean, alternative technology should be an important goal of environmentalists."
"Due to an on going debattle about weither or not computers benefit society I am writing to you to inform you of my opinion on this mater. I believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back. I believe this because. First of all, computer bring about online communication. Also computers advance and enhance learning, had to mention that computers advance emloyment. As I mentioned, computers bring about online communications. Now after reading this there must be one side running thru your head define this well online communication, include social networkinjg sites litre facebook and twitter and not to forget my space. This also includes email and blogs and some chat sites. Okay enough of that But how do these things inventions iprove our lives. These inventions allow long distance communication bringing people ""closer together."" @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And thru facebook, my mother can speak with him any time she wishes and over from their relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 be very nessary @CAPS1 same. Also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication. Besides, I mentioned learinig. Computers can improve learning in a variety of ways. Computers improve learning because they speed the flow of information to the students can go to such places and a school websites to findout more on a particular occuring at the school. @CAPS1 example, I go on my school's website to retreve nightly homewrok assignments and read the next day's daily annocments. Teachers might post helpfel hints on homework and @MONTH1 a detailed explanation of the assignment. Also computers can improve learning by assiting with research projects @CAPS1 example a couple of weeks ago my health class was information car our illegal drug project. So with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it..Slovak Telekom is the convergent telco provider with the largest internet, fixed-line, digital TV, ICT and mobile services portfolio..The highways are open to traffic for those who wish to travel by automobile..China is alleged to have begun a widespread effort to acquire U.S. military technology and classified information and the trade secrets of U.S. companies..Karim was featured on AOL in a show entitled 'Generation Inspiration' which documented stories of young kids who are changing the world using technology..He is CEO of Beech Technology Systems, a tool manufacturer for military, aeronautics, and commercial industries..But unlike a LAN, the UniPro technology was designed to connect chips within a mobile terminal, rather than to connect computers within a building."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 thingk that computers are helping our society, but I disagree. People who are sitting on the computer are not getting exercise or seeing beautiful nature. Do you want to get fat sitting next to a metal box? People are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important. People in your life. Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer. All of the cool, fit people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of the cool people and go outside and have yourself a ban looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals. You can do both of those with your friends and family while sitting on your computer you don't see them as much @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends and I bet you are one of them. Friends and family can also help you get through hard times without them whi knows wgere you would be in life. So do yourself a favor get off the computer, and go visit some really great people. Its now or neve to get off that computer or your family and friends are going to leave you and you are going to get fat on top of that. Do you want to be that person? You are also going to miss out on the beauty of nature. So go, go, go, have yourself some fun..OpenSearch was developed by Amazon.com subsidiary A9 and the first version, OpenSearch 1.0, was unveiled by Jeff Bezos at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference in March, 2005..The museum is located in the Auto Expo Park of Shanghai International Automobile City..The Information Technology Act 2000 governs some of the legal issues pertaining to online dealings but it is silent on the aspect of online pharmacy..Whereas an automobile needs consumable fuel and lubricants to operate, components such as tires, seats, and paint are subject to wear and tear and typically are not covered under any warranty when subjected to normal use..Peter Tippett (born 1953 in Dearborn, Michigan) is an American physician, researcher, and inventor known for contributions to information security, clinical medicine, and technology..The Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT), is an Autonomous Institute of engineering in Pune, India."
"I would agree because computers do help people with other things like vacations sights, jobs, presents and shoping. So many uses for the computer. But creators of the computer are worried that people are spending to much time on the computer. Mainly its about conserners and users, most of those people complain that their having no time with their family and friends. You never know if the users are looking up vacation trips for both friends and familys. The things that conserners dont get is that the computer can teach you alot of things, history, mathmatics, science experiments and many more. Computers are also used in schools to help students with their work, even teachers use the computer for grades. It is true about people not going outside geting some fresh air or even taking a walk in the park. They cant keep themselfs on the computer for like @NUM1 hours, its just crazy. So i would go with both sides. Its just better to enjoy life then just look up things that you dont really need to. You should only need to go on like paying bills, and furneture for your house. Thats why the computer was invented..Michael Jonathan Gale (born October 27, 1962) is a former Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur and venture investor..This program consists of a specialized technical information security training and certification course and practical examination which technical Information Technology professionals can attend in order to become skilled and effective technical Information Security professionals and to prove their level of competence and skill by undergoing the examination..Other major themes in the books are politics, technology (especially disruptive innovation), and either or both of the former as a means to power..The town is also known for the Kete Krachi Secondary Technology..Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy..Carter was educated at Mortlake Secondary School, Reading Technical College and Stafford College of Technology and became an electrical engineer."
"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a world where the uneployment rate rises sinificgently, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just discapeared. I think computers are more benefical to society then some people relize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an acountend. Computer games and @CAPS2 help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teen how to become sucessful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now acess grades in a heartbeat.

"Dear Newspaper: I have just read your recsent article on a weather computers are helping, or recking society. I think it is helping because without the internet I can't learn how to do things such as clear a the proper way. This takes time to learn but out over internet I learned it quickly. If you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you. There are many other uses is you just can't find your family is counting on you. You can do two things, you can panic and let everyone down, you can go or the internet and save. But all I have wasn't to the real. The computer does effect how people exercise I know what you are. but you have. Clear enough. The internet does effect how you exercise. It's pros how to better and more affective ways to healthy. There is also cons; some of the con sinclude hot. All of these can lead to different things like going or. it isn't, its only a bad thing when your.

"Did you know that four out of five households have a computer? But why so many? It's because computers have a positive effect on people, Have you ever thought why? With computers you can contact people in different parts of the @CAPS1. You can search up different information over the internet. Computers also benifit other electronic inventions. What do @LOCATION5, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION6 and @LOCATION7 all have in common? you can contact the people there with computers! while talking to people around the @CAPS1, you can learn something about a culture or lifestyle that you didn't know before. You just might make a new friend along the way. Picture if you will, a hard working business man who lives in the @LOCATION1. He works for a @CAPS1 - famous company and has to go to a meeting with the big boss is @LOCATION4. Wouldn't it just be easier to set up a video chat? That way, there's no hassle with a plane voyage and it's much easier. Why do you think it's called the @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3? Over the internet, you can search up unlimited amounts of information. Animals, sports, a report to do on @LOCATION3, where do you go to find easy-to-read information instantly? Search him up on @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You never what might find out. There are new additions daily. With no computers, how would you download music to an @NUM1? You can't, you have to use a computer. Computers benifit a lot of other electronic equipment. You can download videos, print out photographs and charge @CAPS4 and other electronics. Technology these days is empressive. It gave birth to the much-used computer.

"Dear @CAPS1, The computers that are being used, do have a positive effect on people. For example, there's better communication with friends and family, you get instant news on any topic, and you get advanced education. Imagine if no important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries the person no contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a facebook, or other interacting werbsites, you know what's going on in your friends life all the time without having the to by reaching them all the to see how they are doing. Every adult watching the news at night before they go to bed to see what has @CAPS2, what if you went to bed early. How would you know what happened? That's when you would go online and check what you missed, you could've missed out on what happened in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, or missed out on the wars to the @LOCATION1, or even tragedies that happened right near you. Not only will you have better communication and the news at the top of your fingers, but you will also have advanced education. If a student is doing a science project, but the work doesn't contain all the information the can The internet is a way to expands education. Also, there are and various more.

"The reason why I think computers are good is because people like to do their work, or children likes the games on the computers. The second reasons is that adults likes to do their jobs online.

"Dear Local Newspaper, I am awair that more people use computers everyday. I think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them. Computers gives information about the latest and most recient things that happen in other towns contries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn'@CAPS1 see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn'@CAPS1 find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldnt want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you correct with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That @MONTH1 not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friend close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people @MONTH1 dislike them but they have good reasons why.

"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would wont computors because it benifits our society. It helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on. For example if you wanted to no about it's sports, you can just type in name. Also a computer can help you with your education. If you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. It is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. It is also a good way to communicate with you friends. For example, facebook, @CAPS3, twitter, and email one all good sources of communication. Also it is good for if you have a xbox or a @NUM1 you need a computer you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. It's good to have computors in school. Is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. It is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it. I hope these one all good reason to have computer in our society, and it will benifit us in a number a differnt ways.Under CEO Anubhav Nagar's leadership, Nimbuzz application enables users to enjoy free calls, instant messaging, social games, file sharing, and social networking on their mobile device..The co-editors-in-chief are J.

"More people tend to use computer's more than going outside enjoying the weather, and I think people should less time on the computer and more time interacting with whom ever. People spend most of their time talking to people on any websites/playing online games. I think that it's a bad habit, people of all ages spend their time doing that when they can do something fun, but chose not to. Parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous. There has been many people who have been hired. Raped in websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many other dangerous websites. In be more I would say that children and adults talk to strangers and think they know that personso well, meet them some place and get killed or anything because many people lie they age. And who know that person can be a fiftey year old woman or man. Say their a teen and end up finding you That is why parents should not be let their children be on period of time and should be on.

Have your kinds ever had a freind who for away and your kinds spend hours to them? Well they can talk and see each other while on video chat and it will feel like still here. Its now or never citizens of newtown! You know computers, help the earth there a fast way to spend information, and they let you talk and see your freinds online.

"Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or whatever you talk to your friends are. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be much interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but thats not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there, but then what would be the fun of that. For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, dont you feel great when your going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful I am thankful to god of giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, georgus. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else or even riding your @CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but beacuse of the computer they got that wich really stinks. Now as you can you see computers really can change your life. So that's your discision.

"Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with..The Editcam product family is a result of the development of CamCutter technology developed jointly by Ikegami and Avid Technology..It supplies gas, electricity, landline, broadband and mobile services to residences and businesses..Around the world, Tidewater transports crews and supplies, tow and anchor mobile rigs, assists in offshore construction projects and performs a variety of specialized marine support services..The Nokia Lumia McLaren is an unreleased smartphone developed by Nokia and Microsoft Mobile that utilized a new technology dubbed ""3D Touch"" (a feature that is unrelated and not the same as the 3D Touch feature that was introduced on the iPhone 6s in late-2015)..With a strong focus on New York area news, the Jewish Voice features eight pages of news related to New York City politics, real estate, business, technology, arts and culture and sports..His work takes form of devices, objects, installations, new technology and materials."
"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 that humanity has, has it's up and down's and it's positives and negatives. the something with technology. It has it's ups's and downs but because of it our society grows increasingly advanced. It gives us the oppertunity to grow more sophisticated to set our goals beyond reach. We make the start of great things with these. Computers teach us and sometimes can guide you. You can click on a link and give you an amazing oppertunity or click on the wrong one and give you d virus. Computers can get you away from all the stress in your life and take you to a beautiful place it can give you the chance to let you learn something that you didn't even know existed..Desktop Metal is a technology company that designs and markets metal 3D printing systems..Nulogy is a software as a service technology company that develops, supports, and sells software products in the field of supply chain management, contract packaging, and contract manufacturing..In an interview with Rediff.com, the show creators share that What The Hack! is not a show about hacking or security, but about things you can do with technology..The Google barges were a group of four floating barges built between 2010 and 2012, intended by Google to serve as ""an interactive space where people can learn about new technology"", possibly as luxury showrooms for Google Glass and other products on an invitation-only basis..Jacobus Franciscus (Jacques) Benders (1 June 1924 - 9 January 2017) was a Dutch mathematician and Emeritus Professor of Operations Research at the Eindhoven University of Technology..As a graduate student, he studied meteorology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a master's degree in 1962 and Ph.D. in 1966."
"Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it..Black Book provides values for both new and used vehicles, including cars, light trucks, and collectible vehicles produced since 1946, motorcycles, ATVs, snowmobiles, personal watercraft, and heavy duty commercial trucks and trailers..In 2004, he was the founding Chief Director of the Institute for Economic Research on Innovation (IERI) which is located at the Tshwane University of Technology..His book Identifying Wood: Accurate results with simple tools is an accessible introduction to the topic, and his Understanding Wood is a comprehensive treatment of wood technology..Narula Institute of Technology (NiT) is a private engineering college in West Bengal, India, situated in Agarpara, Kolkata..Outalot is a Web 2.0 and Mobile Web service that provides a social networking, user review, and local search of restaurants, movies, and stores..There is ton of room for innovation in the field of enabling technology."
"When people think about computers the first thing they think of is games. Thats not all they are good for. For most people they are very usefull. Computers are great for @ORGANIZATION1. At @ORGANIZATION1 they help with homework and projects. When we are assigned a project we need to do research on a topic and the fastest and easier way is by computer. The students at @ORGANIZATION2, especially @NUM1 graded, are able to type up easys because it's faster and alot easier. If we are at home and we forgot our homework we could look it up online. This can be really helpful and convient to students and teachers. Sometimes it's not @ORGANIZATION1 but its finding things. Technology and computers have came a long way. Now we can look up directions to places we dont or cant find. People can also finding names, numbers, or address useing websites like yellow pages can be a relieable resource for that. Say your going for vaction and your try to find somewhere to stay it could be tough but there are websites you can go on were if you want something fast or mabye a nice hotel for a low price you can find it. The computer can be very fan and intersting when you go places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and you want to show picture of the great time you had so you can post them online. Say you havent talked to and old friend in a while, you can look for them on @CAPS3 or another website and start talking agian you can also play games and connect with friends or play games with friends while online. Weather its @ORGANIZATION1, finding things, or connecting with frends the computer has what ever you need. Maybe it will at one point get damged but they have people who can fix it. Plus if you think about it computers have very reliable resourses that are more updated then books..IBM demonstrated a prototype millipede storage device at CeBIT 2005, and was trying to make the technology commercially available by the end of 2007..A Bachelor in Information Management (BIM) degree is an academic degree in Information technology requiring four years of study to acquire..The series stars Shane Jacobson, reprising his role of Kenny Smyth, Australia's favorite portaloo plumber who scours the globe for bizarre, intriguing and often downright ridiculous examples of toilet technology..The ERS 5600 Switches can be stacked up to 8 units high to create a 1.152 Tbit/s backplane through the Flexible Advanced Stacking Technology (FAST) stacking technology configuration..The credit card-sized smart card is made of plastic with Philips' MIFARE Classic microchip technology embedded in it..Today, most standalone GPS receivers are used in automobiles."
"Computers can affect people in many ways. Most people use computers too much and it can affect their health and the peole around them. People need to get out side and get more active. America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time. Familys are constantly having problems about family members who never have time to talk and funch holes in walls for losing a video game. Dr. @PERSON1 or ""The studies of the human mind"" says ""I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people."" That goes to show it can cause problems in familys everywhere because of a video game! So please make sure you try to spend time with your family. So that shows that the computer can be fun, but also dangerous..The program gained impetus with the advent of the Vietnam War and was aided by advances in helicopter technology, specifically the development of the turboshaft engine..Born in Kiev, Ukraine, Alexander Kordyuk graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) in 1991, PhD in solid state physics in 1994 and habilitated (DSc in superconductivity) in 2000..It was externally mounted to Columbus with the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF)..Murthy studied electrical engineering at the National Institute of Engineering, University of Mysore, and MTech at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur..In addition to mail trucks and mobile post offices the company also manufactured small boats for both military and commercial use, missile launchers and engines..The Holden HK series is an automobile which was produced by Holden in Australia from 1968 to 1969."
"Computers. Theres fun. But there's also a down side. People spent more time on it than outside or exersizing or even getting together with friends and family. But on ther hand, they're also fun, help kids, and even help get together from dating sites. It makes them happy. It's fun! Computers are fun. They provide a wide arrow of games, educational can just plain fun. You can play role playing games (which and fun because I play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on islands, or other downlodabal education games that are, @CAPS1 not fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child. They also can help kids learn how to and other things at a very early age. Some very adults have and various other things that I cannot the life of me think of @CAPS2 thing computer get them together and they are happy. They do this hundreds of a day. Take away computers and people will die alone and sad. so in conclusion my ideas where! fun help kids and help older people get together. Read this and @CAPS3 sure you'll see it my way..Lord served as vice chairwoman of the National Defense Industrial Association and as a member of the Center for a New American Security's task force on strategy, technology, and the global defense industry..It also provides an opportunity for the participants to interact with prominent personalities associated with Biotechnology and its related fields..The Bunda Journal of Agriculture, Environmental Science and Technology was resurrected in 2004..FiiO Electronics Technology Company, Ltd., or simply FiiO, is a Chinese electronics company that primarily manufactures audio equipment..The external nasal nerve (or external nasal branches) are terminal branches of the anterior ethmoidal nerves (from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve), and provide sensory innervation to the skin of the lower half of the nose and of the septum mobile nasi..It is, however, supported for compatibility reasons by nearly all currently developed operating systems for personal computers and many mobile devices and embedded systems, and thus is a well-suited format for data exchange between computers and devices of almost any type and age from 1981 up to the present."
"Hi my name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing to the local news paper to say that computers are good for people and helps alot like how to get one place two another, how to learn about black history or famous people that did something to the world, and how to find out the news and weather from home or at work, how to keep your besnness going without computers their jobs would be hopless, and like of your family or you tyring to make it in life and the only way to get in contact would be the computers there are computers every where even doctors use them at a hospital to keep people alive to see what wrong with them and where they came from, and one more jobs need computers to, to see if the person is capable for the job so they might look for background information with out it even you would not have a good job so hee are some resons why computers are important. One of them is we need computers for so that we can get around, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers. There lots of more stuff that coulf have said that prove computers are good and why we need them but i just had to cut it short and schools need computers the most to take test on the computers of they have to, so thats all the resons why we need computer and why they are good bye..Towson's University description Towson University's Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) program in information technology constitutes a broad scope of research areas including: Computer Science (CS), Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT)..The Felixstowe hull had superior water contacting attributes and became a key base technology in most seaplane designs thereafter..This link between the phone and base station was carried over Bluetooth (BT Fusion was latterly available using Wifi technology, thus allowing discounts not only at home but over BT Openzone WiFi hotspots)..He held positions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard and is affiliated with the Middlebury Institute of International Studies and James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies..DoCoMo Pacific is a wholly owned subsidiary of predominant mobile phone operator in Japan, NTT DoCoMo..Nulogy is a software as a service technology company that develops, supports, and sells software products in the field of supply chain management, contract packaging, and contract manufacturing."
"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to tell you I think that computers are a good thing because they let people communicate, tons of people haves jobs because of computers and People have help with homework because of computers. People communicate by email and aim and facebook and everything else. People have jobs on computers like cortreporters and tax-retelers and sales people.

"Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion I support the advances in technology. Advances in technology helps us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is because computers/phones can help us get information on things we need to get information on. We need to know what is going on around us, all the time. We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives. We need to know the weather/traffic conditions if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co-worker sent you anything important that you need to know about. The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online. We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer. Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy, even though we can't see them in person. I, for one, knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online. Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong. The last reason why I support advances in technology is because computers can help us with our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. Computers can help our reading skills because if we don't have time to go to the bookstore to get a book, we can read the book online for free. It can help our hand-eye coordination because it can help our fingers move faster and help us do things faster. I stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends / family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills..Rather, environmental problems are seen as problems to be solved using science and technology..Lumitrend, Inc. was a mobile software development firm founded in 2002 by Rob Meadows and Garrett Larsson, and was based in San Mateo, California..Sky Electronics is a mobile phone manufacturer headquartered in Seoul, Korea..In 2004, Solnit was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism, the Sally Hacker Prize from the Society for the History of Technology, and Harvard's Mark Lynton History Prize for River of Shadows..Like traditional CDNs, the primary purpose of a Mobile CDN is to serve content to end users with high availability and high performance..Spiking is a mobile social trading platform which provides financial information about 10 stock exchange markets in Asia and Australia."
"Dear local news, @CAPS2 more and more people use computers people ask if computers actually benifit society. In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, acess to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society here in why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite @CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like @CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the @CAPS1 were @CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather. Instead or local news imidiatly acess it on you @CAPS4 you can acess encyclopedia and distionarys like at the websites @CAPS5 provide an easy imidiats fools for daily uses. One least example towards the of computers Their are many websites that you can. One of @CAPS5 websites is called , @CAPS6 lets you upload picture of pople or family events for people in you @MONTH1 video chat with people over a and see the other persons face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like @CAPS6 it is actually adding time. In conclution, @CAPS5 reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society, They provide entertainment, easy acess to and have many websites for social interactions, @CAPS7 society would be alot harder and this is why I think computers benifit society. .Salalah Mobiles is a 2014 Malayalam romantic comedy film written and directed by debutant Sharath A.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 have many debated on whether computers are good or bad. @CAPS6, I believe that computers aren't as good as many people think. Ever since computers were invented people haven't been exercising. Also less kids are reading. Lastly computers are taking away family time. When was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport? If you haven't it's probably because they are inside with their eyes glued to a computer screen. Exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit. More kids are becoming over weight everyday. Computer are just another reason why. I had a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer. She became very lazy. She never wanted to exercise or doing anything active. Little by little she started gaining weight. This is happening all around the world and it need to @CAPS4! What's your reading level? @CAPS3 are students in @NUM1 grade with a @NUM2 grade reading level. Part of the reason is because they rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book. Schools now do program called @CAPS5 @NUM3. This program is designed to help students improve their reading levels. I believe that if students would turn off the computers long enough and @CAPS5 we wouldn't need this program. My mom makes sure I @CAPS5 for at least @NUM4 mins everyday. Every student do the same. I remember a saying ""family time is golden time"" @CAPS6, now a days no one spends time with their family. Once again computers have played a part in this too. It's not just kids who have droped family time for computer time. It's adults too. I think the last time I spent some time with my family was about @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit. After that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens. In conclusion, the computers.While the car's advanced design makes it impossible to functionally create with 2015 technology, the company has discussed creating it a few decades in the future, when technology has caught up with the car's design..E-Speak was a middleware technology created by Hewlett-Packard in 1999..Loremo was focused on designing prototypes of cars with very low weight and air resistance, the term ""Loremo"" is an abbreviation for ""Low Resistance Mobile""..He chose to return to India from NASA, United States for the development of Propulsion Technology in ISRO..The Stanca Act is an Italian law of 2004 that promotes the accessibility of information technology..The term can thus mean any technology ranging from real-time online chat and online interaction with strangers (e.g., online forums) to fully immersive graphical social environments."
"Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' schoolworks. Finally, you are able to talk with other people on-line. These are just a few points why computers are very importent, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind becasue you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convinient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in-laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, now-a-days they even have on-line tutors and on-line colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With videochat, chatrooms, facebook and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even on-line dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after mu uncle divoriced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those on-line dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way.

"Many people have been talking about computers in the @ORGANIZATION1. Networks like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS2 have be saying that the computers are turning the people in lazy goodd for notings. But I say different! I think the advances in technology is a good thing. Way? I'll give you @NUM1 reasons. My first reason is they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Next reason is makes life better. And my last reson is it give you hand-eye coordination @CAPS3't you sick of haveng to go to the book stor and find a book to do a project? well now with the computers you don't have to. You just go online and look up the info that you need to learn about almost anything form the use to @LOCATION1.

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I rencently started researching the effects that computers have on people an have found some shocking facts. I do not belive computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future. My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fine, and thosands of creatures. With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities. Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead you can just @CAPS2 or email them and @CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person! In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers! Thank you for your time and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter. .Prior to joining BU, she was a Postdoctoral Researcher and then a Research Scientist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)..Numbrs Personal Finance AG (formerly known as Centralway Numbrs) is a financial technology company based in Switzerland..Content covered includes environmental issues, education, urban planning, design, politics, culture, technology, and health..At the Boston afterparty, participants collaborated on the composition of a Manifesto for the Future of Music Technology Research..It has been officially merged since the Linux 2.6.25 release, it was the main access control mechanism for the MeeGo mobile Operating System..He was honored with the MIT Technology Review's TR35 award in 2010."
"A lot of people use computers today. But not everybody thinks they benifit society. But computers can do anything! You can do reaserch, you can play games, and most of all, be free. Were you ever given a school project to do, but no book has the information you want? Well the internet does. A lot of computers are connected to the interact where you can find anything! Are you trying to find facts for your science project? Just go on your favorite search engine and search your topic. You'll find endless pages on anything. Even if your not doing school work, you can find anything on the internet. Did you forget the number of your favorite football player? Search his name and it'll tell you right on your screen. Are you wondering why the @CAPS1 won the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Your choices are endless! Even if your computer doesn't have internet, you can play games. Playing games on your computer is a great hobbie! And if you are connected to the internet, you can play games with other people around the world. Playing games on your computer is a great hobbie, but you cant play all the time, you need to find other things to do to. There are a variety of computer games. Adventure games, shooting games multiple player games, and more! You can even play poker on your computer. I think the best part of any computer is your freeness while on one. You can do almost anything. You can go on the internet, play games and even talk with people. You can also customize your computer to your liking. Do you have a picture of your cat? You can put it as your background on the desktop. Want a different curser, you can change that to! You can change anything you want with just a click on your mouse. There you go, there are endless possibilities with computers. You can learn, play, and be free.

"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society..He is credited with being part of: CYBERIA, the UK's first internet cafe; Easynet, Europe's first consumer Internet Service Provider; RealNames, the first multi-lingual addressing system for the Internet; Archimedes Ventures LLC, a vehicle for his incubation, investments and consulting service; TechCrunch, a technology blog..JavaFX 2.x does not support the Solaris operating system or mobile phones; however, Oracle plans to integrate JavaFX to Java SE Embedded 8, and Java FX for ARM processors is in developer preview phase..Wireless Health is the integration of wireless technology into traditional medicine, such as diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of illness, as well as other tools that can help individuals improve their personal health and wellbeing..Corliss Orville Burandt is an American engineer who invented a system of variable valve timing in automobile engines..According to their website, company leadership includes President Dan Botsch; Director of Business Development Michael Maness; Director of Operations Mike Chang; and Director of Technology Paul Chadha..It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, and for the mobile phone."
"Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!.As a producer of reality, documentary, and unscripted infotainment programming, BASE Productions uses a trademark motion-capture and CGI technology..Virginia College offers classes, certificates, diplomas, and degrees related to specific professions, such as health and medical, information technology, business, office management, and criminal justice..Amobee is a marketing technology company whose Brand Intelligence technology measures digital engagement..It is intended to work with the Microchip Technology MPLAB suite installed; it has its own IDE (Scintilla-based) and it is a highly optimized compiler..Kathy Kinloch is a Canadian executive who is President of the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) and has received awards for being one of the most influential women in the province's business sector..Jyrobike technology is intended to help children and adults learning to ride a bicycle, and people who lack confidence in their balance and mobility skills."
"Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to..SpotCrime.com is a part of the Emerging Technology Center (ETC) in Baltimore..The STEP logo was originally a trademark of Parsons Technology, Inc., now of FindEx, Inc., the current publisher of QuickVerse Bible Software..Ebeid has over three decades of experience in media, technology and telecommunications, having held senior roles at IBM, Optus Communications, Two Way Limited, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Special Broadcasting Service (SBS)..The design process is inherently a knowledge-intensive activity, so a great deal of the emphasis for KBE is on the use of knowledge-based technology to support computer-aided design (CAD) however knowledge-based techniques (e.g. knowledge management) can be applied to the entire product lifecycle..CSCS is an autonomous unit of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) and closely collaborates with the local University of Lugano (USI)..Services are provided on a commissioned ship that contains a specially constructed mobile clinic, the A-Portable."
"@PERCENT1 of all people in the @LOCATION3 have computers. This number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer. It help us communicate better get imformation quicker and entertain us. Computer have a very positive effect on us. With the invention of the computer, more and more people can communicate quicker and eaisier. For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, @CAPS1 you have relatives who live across the country, you could use webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world. You can learn alot more about other countries culture and other cities way of life. Finally, @CAPS1 a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, the relationship just gets better. The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet you can findout how tall a maple tree is or , how to lose weight. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities nature walks and new and exciting excersises. When students need information on a school project, they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it. When the computer came, people could plaly games, watch @CAPS2.V. and movies, and do business. @CAPS1 you missed you favorite @CAPS2.V. Show you can go online and watch them. @CAPS1 you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, e-mail comes into place, and you mail will never be slow. And finally, you can play many, many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination. With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. Theres information quicker, communication better, and entertainment better. All of the search were in a very good world..A picture archiving and communication system (PACS) is a medical imaging technology which provides economical storage and convenient access to images from multiple modalities (source machine types)..These are currently designed, manufactured, and marketed by TCL Communication (under the brand of BlackBerry Mobile), BB Merah Putih, and Optiemus for the global, Indonesian, and Indian markets (respectively) using the BlackBerry brand under license..Contour crafting is a building printing technology being researched by Behrokh Khoshnevis of the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute (in the Viterbi School of Engineering) that uses a computer-controlled crane or gantry to build edifices rapidly and efficiently with substantially less manual labor..Nokia released a computer-generated video demonstrating the capabilities the Morph might have if it were a real mobile phone..A Pocket PC (P/PC, PPC), also known by Microsoft as a 'Windows Mobile Classic device', is a kind of personal digital assistant (PDA) that runs the Windows Mobile operating system..He is the founder of early web hosting pioneer Burlee.com, now part of Web.com, and the founder of Section 32, a California-based venture fund focused on frontier technology."
"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you want people to be so memorized by a computer that they miss out in the world around them? @CAPS1 you want the kids in @LOCATION1 to spend hours each day on the computers playing games while they could be outside getting fresh air? The question then is, @CAPS1 computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is bad effect. People constantly use the computers teach them bad habbits and can search inappropriate things. IF people are always playing games the computers then when @CAPS1 they go out for a jag. The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in @LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""@CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, you know it you've wasted the wrote day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really and you don't to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get air. As you can computer can mesmorised a lot so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on bad habbits. For example, kids are always. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people dont use the. Too much and get too used writing like that. Then, kids @MONTH1 start doing that on writing in school and most even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to. learn your. Lastly is very easy for people, even to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words ad pictures and no one would ever know. people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to no easy to inappiopriate things. So go and limit the time you on computer..The method has been used in architecture, healthcare, product development, processes design, information technology systems, and even to create lean business models..Mojo Motors, Inc. was an American automotive classified website for preowned automobiles..It is only through centuries of understanding as well as modern technology that we are now able to diagnose and treat those afflicted properly..In June 2008 PBS started to roll out new technology upgrades to their systems, specifically a new CAS system for their pay television platform..Institute of Textile Technology, Choudwar is the only institute in orissa offering engineering course in Textile Technology..The workshop was taken over by Fabrique Automobile Belge."
"Yes, I believe that computers benefits society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn and lastly compoters are apart of todays technology. First of all, computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have. Computers have helped todays life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didnt know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likley you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where its located or anything else abot it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say your going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the adress and the internet will give you directions. Even if you dont know when your favorite to show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefits society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well, because one of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about christmas i found her on facebook and now we talk and catch up because we havent seen each other in years, @CAPS2 alone tak to her. Another reason why is that if someones mon or dad is away at war or oversea's then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, skype, yahoo instant messenger, with the webcam or the telephone just @CAPS2 alone just typing back and fourth. You could also just use it for a job buisness to talk to your co-worker or one of your workers on webcam to see things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technollogy has come a long way. For example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use. Today you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font and much more. Another reason why is with iphones or i touches now you dont have to be at home you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to. To find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza but technollogy has come a long way. So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didnt knew before and finally computers have changed a lot and they are apart of our technology. .In prokaryotes however, apart from transposable elements that may move within the genome, mobile genetic elements that can move between genomes other important components of the mobilome are extremely important in genetics and ecology..D.T. processes have adopted Building Information Modeling (BIM) to quicken construction, design and facilities management using technology..It was recorded in one of the United States Capitol recording studios and in Mobile..The Ford Custom is an automobile which was produced by Ford in the United States, Canada and Australia in certain years from 1949 to 1981..Rave Mobile Safety (formerly Rave Wireless) is an American software company founded in New York City in 2004, and currently based in Framingham, Massachusetts..Both were used in the Cadillac V-16 automobile, the first from 1930 until 1937, and the second between 1938 and 1940."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial.

"As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has a extremely positive effect on people. Computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer are; teach hand-eye coordination. give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last hit not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explaine more about what a positve effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just ga off and playing video games on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. when you use the computer there os so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a in your socical or history about the country or and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand-eye coordination. First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skills, you should try to look at the computer screan. and not be working down at you finger keys. Not only is that not helping you hand-eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truely is unbelievable. Are you one of those people who's parents don't you get a phone because use of how much it costs without even the cost of texting? Well if you are, the computer help you out with that problem aswell!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use @CAPS1 to instant your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The comp. is so hanndy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w/ hand-eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the comp is a in every household..At the same time, the United States has substantial capabilities in both defense and power projection thanks to its advanced technology and large military budget..The year 1686 in science and technology involved some significant events..In the United States, classroom projects and competitions can operate under the aegis of the Technology Student Association at middle school and high school levels..Mobile to mobile calls do not require the ""0""..It is also available on mobile..SecureWare Inc., founded in 1986 developed software and encryption technology for securing Unix-based operating systems."
"Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have an bad effect on people. I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up. I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adult to. That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effects is just helpful ness..All products in the One series were designed to be touchscreen-based and slate-sized, and to initially run the Android mobile operating system (Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich or subsequent Android releases) with the HTC Sense graphical user interface..Ranken offers programs in five main divisions: Automotive, Electrical, Construction, Information Technology, and Manufacturing..Anant Kumar Agarwal from the Cree Inc., Chapel Hill, NC was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2012 for contributions to silicon carbide power device technology..United Therapeutics is a biotechnology company..The technology at the time used a slot in the metal to lock the ring to a jewel..At present NPC offers degree programs in business administration, education, computer technology, short-term courses."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive effect on people. Spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so important that have throuhout school teaching us how to type. we also use hand-eye coordination is loaded and. You have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the. Computers are helpful in many ways. Have you ever about what looks like or what would be found on it? With a computer you can. Comuputers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get pictures some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who lies there. Yes, you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life easier. Computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. They give you the oppurtunity to talk with people online whether the world the street. In order to do this you need a web. They are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. Its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country. Its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spanding to much time an computer and not on exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. All of these things should be. All you have to do is manage your time. Or not all day on the computer. If you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created.

"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION3.

"Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to eachother. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along. His buisiness transfered @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh-air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vaction. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vaction because they don't know about the country or place..In addition to discussing legal issues on his blogs, Schaefer has also contributed to publications such as Modern Domainer and Law Technology News..The company comprises its primary channel as well as eight sub-channels that specialize in technology, travel, and other topics..The Airflow was one of the first full-size American production car to use streamlining as a basis for building a sleeker automobile, one less susceptible to air resistance..Clipgenerator is an online and mobile multimedia application and videocreation technology which generates animated music video clips from User photos and videos..Remote mobile virtualization, like its counterpart desktop virtualization, is a technology that separates operating systems and applications from the client devices that access them..The compact cassette technology was originally designed for dictation machines, but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the Stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living..The school is a dual specialist technology college and language college..Admission to the under-graduate courses such as Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) and Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) programs in NITs are through the highly competitive Joint Entrance Examination (Main)..NETROOM 2.0 continued to focus on virtual machine task-switching as its primary memory management technology..He is a professor of synthetic chemistry at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, and a visiting professor at Henan Normal University and guest professor at East China University of Science and Technology, both in China..He has tried to focus on companies who supported the Syrian government with information technology solutions to monitor the internet..Due to the great potential of the developed technology, this GPU-accelerated software was subsequently commercialized."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world..Most were made of bronze because of a lack of metallurgic technology, but cast and wrought-iron guns were common as well, particularly later on..Banking software and network technology allow a bank to centralize its record keeping and allow access from any location..It was one of North Carolina's first suburbs designed to be completely serviced by the automobile, well beyond urban transportation routes..Vodafone Direto is a low-cost Mobile Virtual Network Operator, launched in 2005 in Portugal, over the network Vodafone..His pioneering contributions to biotechnology were recognized by the Jacob Heskel Gabbay Award in Biotechnology and Medicine, in 1999..He is an alumnus of the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (now Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi) (bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering), Indian Institute of Science (master's in Aero Engineering) and IIT Bombay (Ph.D)."
"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you..Originally as a mobile TV dongle service, until now distributes digital set-top boxes, as well as freemium digital TV channels..In the European Union, it also refers to an attempt to better link together these key concepts, with research and innovation already highlighted by the development of the Lisbon Strategy and, more recently, lies behind the creation of the European Institute of Technology (EIT)..She studied architecture at the Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria, South Africa..Buffer credits, also called buffer-to-buffer credits (BBC) are used as a flow control method by Fiber Channel technology and represent the number of frames a port can store..After the termination of the Tourmobile contract, companies including Gray Line Worldwide and Open Top Sightseeing began providing National Mall tours..The company was focused on a technology of treating dental problems by using stem cells."
"Has a computer helped you ever answerd hard question or type up an essay for school for work? I know a computer has helped me far years so why would I teminate it or want it gone. Heres the controversy, many experts believe computers don't benefit society but people, such as myself, believe the exact oppositte. Their are many benefits to oconing a computer such as they're always a source of information, allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, have their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamon. He never found the diamond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. due to a computer he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of. also, computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones, with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication. for example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss, you can even choose what type of handwriting it types. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. Althourgh, some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addition. Still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work..Strand Life Sciences, formerly Strand Genomics, is a Bengaluru, India-based in silico technology company..According to the 2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), Eudoxa is rated number 25 (of 45) in the ""Top Science and Technology Think Tanks"" of the world..The association intends to do this by standardization of the software and hardware used to communicate between mobile devices with cameras and printing devices through collaboration and the implementation of guidelines..Howard C.

"I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the "" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives @NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games.

"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers affect our country in a positive way. Three reasons why I think so are comunication, @CAPS2, entertainment and, @CAPS3. One of my favorite things to do is talk and when on of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number I thought we had no way of doing it. One day he requested me on facebook and from there on we have been comunicating on web sites like facebook, myspace and, skype. My second reason why computer's benifit our society is @CAPS2. At my dad's house I do not have a television so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world. A website called @CAPS4.com was the frist to anounce @PERSON1's death befor anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break rest on the internet. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, comunicate with friends. The last reason why computers benefit our society is @CAPS3. Many @CAPS3 in our comunity require computer skills such as a acountant, a manager, software designner, and a computer programer. The computer make @CAPS3 and more eficient by correcting mistakes, providing a visual and typeing. These are the reasons why computers affect our community in a positive way..Commonly used in automobiles, as well as construction machinery, cable harnesses provide several advantages over loose wires and cables..Nine Technology pioneered use of Imation-branded RDX portable hard drives to implement cloud backup services without requiring an initial over-the-wire backup..New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.

"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is great concern about computers and wether or not people spend to much time sitting infront of the screen or not. I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising, enjoying, and being with family and friends. Exercising is a major part of every persons life and if you don't get enough of it you could become obeise. Obeisity @MONTH1 cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don't care what others think, but in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way. exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny joy, go for a walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant 'in person? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn't you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would and I think most other people would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, nature, and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life..Smeds was born in Uppsala and received his Licentiate in Technology from the Department of Electrical Measurements at the Lund University Faculty of Engineering in 1972..Microsoft Software Updater (earlier Nokia Software Updater and Ovi Suite Software Updater) is a Windows and OS X (though the Mac version is only in Beta) based application launched in 2006, that enables customers to update and recover their mobile device firmware of a S40 or S60 or Lumia device from any Internet enabled access point..ACLD also operates a branch at the county jail, and two bookmobiles..It could also be the first network in the Philippines to fully adopt EMV technology on all its ATM cards, although the regular magnetic stripe cards are also an option for the network..The group wants to enable mobile operators to deliver voice and messaging services over upcoming LTE radio access networks using the same core networks they use today to support voice services on 2G/GSM and 3G/UMTS radio access networks..The Broadcast Control Channel (BCH) transport channel is mapped onto the P-CCPCH, allowing mobiles to decode important system parameters prior to establishing a dedicated connection."

"People the computer is something good and cool. Why is cool? is cool because the computer help you in everything. I have reasons. The first reasons is when in your school you have homework, work, project or something like that the computer help you a lot. Because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side. The second reason is the computer help you in your house for example: You have the big problem with your car or something like that. You can go in the computer in @LOCATION1 and the you see the pieces of your car. The thrid reason for the computer is so cool is because in this time you can make the everything thing. We can go the web and facilitate our life. Now you can realize the work, homework, project, ideas, writting book, chat, information, print picture, and ect... And that you are architect you can make your proper work or house you see the computer is so cool. But some people use the computer for bad thing for example: for pornography or something bad this is not cool and is not appropiate for people. The computer is something fabolous and super genius. My opinion is that the computer help a lot is something like need in our life. No for live but for our life or something @CAPS1. Something you can see your family for webcam. This is fabolous but don't used the webcam for something bad you can learn thing that you don't know. I think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing. Appraise the computer.

Anything, as in research or personal reasons. First off, let me point out that computers are useful multi-purpose tools. Computers can also, @CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people. A lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end. Students sometimes go home and strayht oor tug computer instead of doing homework.

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 would a person do with out a computer? Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you @MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you @MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way. .Aled Euros Miles (born May 23, 1965) is a British information technology executive and internet security expert based in Los Angeles, CA..Apal is a small-scale automobile company originally from Belgium..The school also has specialisms in technology and languages..The Research Institute for Arts and Technology (RIAT) is an independent Austrian research institute established in 2015 and located in Neubau, Vienna..Billon is a fintech company operating in UK and Poland which developed a technology to store and transfer regulated currencies and other data using a proprietary blockchain..Its mission is to advance the science and technology of architecture through mutual collaboration by its members."
"I remember when computer wernt so popular. Back then I had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio. Now computers are very popular. I believe that computers have positive effect on people @DATE1 because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to acess them. You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. Which is good because its much easier. For example im a student that can't draw so printed some pictures of the computer so I can paste them on my post board. So in the other words the computer is useful for students. I know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or its a zero. In this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of intersting because you can up with friend that you haven't seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantaes because you would have nvever thought you will see your friend doing. Another thing about computers that you can fint stuff cheaper than everyday lif say if you want to a trip and you call @ORGANIZATION1 for your ticket. The ticket came up to . But you go on the computer and you on @ORGANIZATION1 website and find your ticket to florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a restion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convince. At home if my labtop is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what to do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to acess one!

"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh tha's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise. .The Melanesian John Frum cargo cult believed in a return of their ancestors brought by Western technology..The Chief of Naval Research has responsibility for basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development components of the Navy's research and development programs (the first three of the seven categories used in the Department of Defense research and development budget, often referred to as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, respectively), as well as the Navy's intellectual property policy..He is a professor of Applied Mathematics and Dean of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology..Team KART is a group of students from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur who like to explore the practical side of automotive engineering..It was developed by Mark E.

"Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication..Over the last decade due to rapid changes in preservation technology microfilm has been replaced by digital media..The Bank operates 27 branches and provides regular ATM service as well as online, mobile, and SMS banking services..Its surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and popular culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades..Complete Streets emphasize the importance of safe access for all users, not just automobiles..This allowed The Commonwealth Bank of Australia to become the first bank to manage customers operations from a single mobile application..The European Technology Platform on Nanomedicine (ETP Nanomedicine) is a European Technology Platform initiative to improve the competitive situation of the European Union in the field of nanomedicine, the application of nanotechnology to medicine."
"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!.It shared the front-wheel drive A platform with the similar Buick Century, Pontiac 6000 and Chevrolet Celebrity; both Oldsmobile and Chevrolet considered using the Celebrity name, which had originally been used by Oldsmobile in the 1960s..It is also famous as a class once required at the Georgia Institute of Technology..She earned her BA in chemistry at Manhattanville College and her MSc and PhD degrees in polymers and materials science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology..He was killed in an automobile accident in 1982..The institute trains students in engineering and technology at the certificate, diploma, degree, post-graduate and doctoral levels..Usha Mittal Institute of Technology (UMIT) is an engineering college in Mumbai affiliated to SNDT Women's University."
"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job..Ultimate Angels is a wrestling video game created by Tecmo for mobile phones in Japan..Dr Fernandes had developed glycoprofiling technology for his doctorate in the Glycobiology Institute at the University of Oxford and in the late 1980s was responsible for transfer of that technology to Oxford GlycoSciences (OGS)..He works closely with modern technology, exploring the performance potential of MIDI..Tech News 2Night, or TN2, was a podcast that gave a daily summary of technology news stories which took place since the morning broadcast of Tech News Today (TWiT's morning news show) and also covering news stories of the day..It functions under the umbrella of the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE), Government of Kerala..More recently however, complete new science and engineering laboratories, workshops and studio have sprung up with heavy machines telling the tales of modem technology."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society. Well I would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way. The computer is like a addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. I dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Every were you look theres a computer. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? .Being a graduate of Imperial College London, he is a Civil Engineering Professor at K. N.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers have increased. You don't see kids outside as often. On the news, you hear about obesity. And you hear the crime rates go up. This does not benefit the socierty. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone's name and be underover. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick-minded people get to you or your kids.

"My opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out. If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she sould go out side and get some fresh air and get some exrcise. Some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurder/kill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralized from lack of exercise or get lumf ophemia thats when your body a pears and will not be a to exercise and would need special treatments. Like masogise. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand eye coordination by useing the still looking sometimes some people for useing the computer: videos, video, and websites. You can get your computer uloaded for for quality. Some systems howe computers in them or can be connected to the computer like the, and the @CAPS1 @NUM1 @CAPS2. There are games called p.c. games some p.c. games comeucicate with childern to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also spiecal computers and/or web-sites you can search for tutorial for speaking different langueges. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instroments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptynis inside of them inistead of eating. Some people obeuse the compeuter as a dug like they're addictied to it.

"Wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life. I would, we need computer for many things, for example we need computer for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. Next this is good for buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @MONTH1 have missed as if you was absent. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @MONTH1 be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Now a days many college students with work going on @MONTH1 not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. With computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @CAPS1 from the I have told you like communications, education, and buying and selling products I hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society.RMIT's School of Economics, Finance and Marketing is an Australian tertiary education school within the College of Business at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University), located in Melbourne, Victoria..All technology and research is being developed and collected at UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science by a team of well experienced staff and the school's graduate students..The International Speech Communication Association (ISCA) is a non-profit organization and one of the two main professional associations for speech communication science and technology, the other association being the IEEE Signal Processing Society..The soundtrack differs from the film in that it uses background noises of a driving car while the whole plot is set in the 19th century (before automobiles were invented)..EcoDrive is a free software codeveloped by Microsoft and Fiat Automobiles..College of Applied Science and Technology strives to produce individuals with skills in critical thinking."
"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on peoples' lives. You can do alot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convinient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see @LOCATION1, you can go online to learn @CAPS1 language. You can also study food s that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can daunloads and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure that let you explore new lands. And in alot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are otherways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, facebook, twitter, and video chat. With any of these things you can talks to friends or family around the world or in your state/country. All of these you can either download, go on the internet for, or buy them. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you havent seen in a while. Video chat you can see eacho ther, face book you can share pictures and chat rooms you can talk with multiple people.

"The computer is able to do so many things. It think computers have posotive effects on people. But some experts believe they don’t which is why I'm writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. Computers believe it they help us in life wether @CAPS1 to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @DATE1, @CAPS1 one of the most important devices. Let me share my expierence okay. I had a job interview right well I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview. Thats why I think computers have posotive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. Well I have some people spend to much time on their computer @CAPS1 completely choice. And those are people who usually don't have alot of self control. And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. So in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important..Nokia 5100 is a Nokia GSM mobile phone model that was announced in 2002 and released in 2003..It is also famous as a class once required at the Georgia Institute of Technology..The BIOS Center for the Study of Bioscience, Biomedicine, Biotechnology and Society is an international center for research and policy on social aspects of the life sciences and biomedicine located at the London School of Economics (LSE), England..Prior to this he attended University of Mobile..In the past ten years the campus has been updated with additional technology capacity, a new performing arts building and a field turf athletic stadium..He is the chief executive officer of TVCLabs, a technology business accelerator based in Lagos and also sits on the boards of Sproxil, Strika Entertainment, TechnoVision Communications and PeoplePrime."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. But why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer. I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. Sure enough he was! I got the home work and got an A all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others..Educated at the California Institute of Technology, Amherst College and at Deep Springs College, he has contributed research fundamental to understanding of the composition of the Earth and the behavior of materials under high temperatures and pressures..GCF was founded in 1999, and its membership has been responsible for creating an independent certification program to help ensure global interoperability between mobile devices and networks..Zeta was the original name for General Motors' full-size rear-wheel drive automobile platform developed by GM's Australian subsidiary company Holden and was most recently referred to as the ""Global RWD Architecture""..It is a wholly owned subsidiary of UCL and is responsible for conducting technology development and commercial transactions for the university..Romankiw earned his B.S. from the University of Alberta in 1957, and both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees (in metallurgy and materials) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1962..Applications can range from building fire alarm systems to mobile plant machinery."
"Dear whom it @CAPS1, Have you ever wondered what it be like to spend all your time in front of computers? Well, if you are, I believe that should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom says only an hour aa day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and (or) play over a friends house. Yes, playing on computer is fun, but you have to execise to. (you know) @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors. Like that's how I met trees, animals, beautiful senery. You could feel like you were having the time or your. The last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use. you could make snowmen in the winter or if it's raining you could watch a movie. you could build a lot. In conclusion building, playing and jumping (the list could go on) You can enjoy the outdoors. Just rember the three good reason why are you could use the wonderful and lovly outdoors. Go walk you dog, have friends ober or even just having out with your family and friends..Previously, he served as President of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and Vice President and Dean of Rochester Institute of Technology..Clifford Brown & Max Roach is a 1954 album by influential jazz musicians Clifford Brown and Max Roach as part of the Clifford Brown and Max Roach Quintet, described by The New York Times as ""perhaps the definitive bop group until Mr. Brown's fatal automobile accident in 1956""..The mobile device intended for a mass African markets was announced during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 2016..Superscape Group plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: SPS), and had offices in Hook, Hampshire (UK), San Clemente, California (USA) and Moscow (Russia) until being purchased by Glu Mobile in early 2008..In JTIDS Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) (similar to cell phone technology), each time interval (e.g., 1 second) is divided into time slots (e.g. 128 per second)..He is well-cited in the fields of economic sociology, social networks, science and technology studies, and social change and development."
"I agree that we shold have computers, because more and more people use computers. Long time ago we don't even have computers, but now we do. Now we have computers we should use it. If we don’t use computers why we even have computers? Computers can help you to learn faraway places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and other faraway places. If we don't know what is going on faraway places then we don't know what kind flag they have and what do they eat, what do they have, are what they do, and what do they speak. You can even talking online with your friends on computer! You dont have to call you friend, you can just talk to you frien on online, if you need help with your homework are you left your math text book at school you frient can tell you the questions by talking online. If your friend is in @LOCATION2 are other faraway places your friend can bring there computer with him or her so your friend can just talking to you by talking online, you dont have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other places. You can also learn how to type, when you know how to type you can type faster and faster. You can type storys, poem, and notes are something you have to do at school, so you don't have to write on a pace of peaper you can just type on computer. That is why we should have computers and use more. I hope you agree with me..Media Technology /Octopus TV is a cloud based video content management and delivery platform, which enables the storage, management and global delivery of video and other files..The questions and polls used on the show were from the G4tv.com discussion forums live chatroom and were on any topic concerning games or the technology of gaming..Web interoperability is producing web pages viewable with standard compatible web browsers, various operating systems such as Windows, Macintosh and Linux, and devices such as personal computers (PCs), PDAs, mobile phones and tablets based on the latest web standards..The company specializes in design for corporate, office, hospitality, retail, education, science and technology, government and mixed-use projects..Part of the PlayNow service was the TrackID mobile music recognition service..Link Labs is an American company based in Annapolis, Maryland, that develops computer network technology for business and industrial customers."
"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people..Solaris Containers (including Solaris Zones) is an implementation of operating system-level virtualization technology for x86 and SPARC systems, first released publicly in February 2004 in build 51 beta of Solaris 10, and subsequently in the first full release of Solaris 10, 2005..Shershah College of Engineering (SCE) is a government engineering college managed by the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of Bihar..He went on to Georgia Southern University and was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the third round of the 2003 amateur draft and was signed on June 30, 2003.He is currently a high school technology teacher and coach to the Jenkins County War Eagles baseball team..Snap Inc. is an American technology and camera company, founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy and based in Venice, California..Oxford College was founded in 2003, and offers diplomas related to the dental hygiene, clinical research and other medical and pharmaceutical occupations including Medical Laboratory Assistant and Technician Diploma, and Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Technology etc. ..Branded versions were released for Vodafone, T-Mobile and Orange called the V550, E550 and V545 respectively."
"@CAPS1 you want people to be over weight? @CAPS1 you wat our beautifal out doors to be ruined? And @CAPS1 you want familys to be distant because they are to pre @CAPS2? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of familys dont talk because they are to preocupied with computar games. The issue to grapple with is @CAPS1 computars have an affect on people. Yes, I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enought exersize, they dont enjoy the nature that we have, and they dont inter act with there family and friends. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enough exersize. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight spend more time on the computar than on the track. I remember a time when I was over weight be cause I spent to much time on the computar. One day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and I had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize. @CAPS1 you want kids to be over weight like I was? Many people dont get to enjoy the great out doors because they are to preocupied with the computar. Lisa, a volentere worker in @LOCATION1, says ""This feild used to be a vast array of plants and animal life, but now it is a waste land because of computars. No one had the time to worry of the natural wonder because they were to @CAPS2 with there computar animated jobs and didnt care what came of it. @CAPS1 you want this to happen to our country? @PERCENT4 of high technological places are dirty with very little plant life because the workers need to tend to the computars rather than the bushes. Some familys have a hard time talking about their dayly lifes becuse they spendin to much time on the computar and dont spend the time to talk and get to know each other. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 ofdevorces are related to not being able to have aconversation and with more technoligy on the way that number will grow. I remember that my parents got devorced because my dad spent more time on the computar than talking to me or my mom. Most people think that computars are good for research. Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house insted of in a big library with all the information you need. I think that computars have a negitive impact on people..Stevens-Duryea was an American manufacturer of automobiles in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts, between 1901 and 1915 and from 1919 to 1927..Dynamic Signal is a technology company, offering a mobile-first company communications platform, based in San Bruno, California..Dr. Ramokgopa is the chancellor of Tshwane University of Technology..The journal was founded in 2007 at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of Bialystok University of Technology..SalesGossip is a UK based website and mobile app that offers access to sale and promotional updates aggregated from fashion and beauty retailers..He is on the International and United States Board of Advisors for Microsoft's Partners in Learning program, and he has worked with the Gates Foundation to develop technology-enhanced workshops that link learning and leadership."
"I agree with the computers helping people. To start with, computers have a possitive affect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Also it allows people to talk online from far away places. So, yes, computers are good for people. First of all, computers do have a possitive affect. The computer @MONTH1 give some one motivation. Or it will help someone find their lost pet. Also it could help you get a job. Plus you can find a safe home with it. So, ya computers do have a possitive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. Also you can get information on places you will visit. This will help learn about diffrent contrays. Most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. This concluds that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for familys. Also people who have hospitilized family. Plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a possitive affect on people. They given us ability to learn! Lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away. So, in conclution, it is a benifit for people to use the computers!.Jim has directed and/or edited commercials for Sprite, Boost Mobile, Nike, Inc., the Virginia Tobacco Settlement Fund, Ford Motor Company and Interscope Records..LPC (linear predictive coding) was the speech synthesis technology used, which allowed applications to encode speech data in a compact form..The Marion Street Bridge is an automobile bridge located in Salem, Oregon, United States..Early on it opted for a technology-neutral policy, developing standards that multiple technology vendors could follow in implementing products and services for its members and customers..ITEST engages students and teachers in authentic, hands-on learning experiences in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly referred to as 'STEM' or 'SET' [more common in the U.K.])..School is functioning in the space earmarked by the National Institute of Technology Calicut and is being promoted as a staff welfare measure of the institute and the Department of Electronics and Accreditation of Computer Classes center in Kozhikode."
"Dear State legistator, @CAPS1 you live back a long time ago when there were no computers. The only diffrence now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder. I deffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone elses lifes easier. With the computer it teaches hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I belive the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from “@CAPS2 drivers.com” the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decraced over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like “@CAPS3” a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pa. the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in “@CAPS4-tech” magazine. I should also add in it has reconected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online. So do me a favor state legislator relize and come to terms how much society needs the computer..The history of webcomics follows the advances of technology, art, and business of comics on the Internet..The Institute of Biosciences and Technology (IBT), a component of the Texas A&M Health Science Center represents the Texas A&M University System, one of the two main Texas state university systems, in the state's and world's largest medical center, the Texas Medical Center, in Houston, Texas..Prism Skylabs' technology is deployed in over 80 countries and is used by more than 300 customers around the world..A shift kit is a set of components for automobiles designed to improve how well the car shifts between gears..The MIT Mystery Hunt is an annual puzzlehunt competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology..Unity Biotechnology is a startup biotechnology company that aims to develop drugs which target senescent cells with the aim of extending life span."
"Computers can take a lot of a person's time, but there are also benefits to having one. You could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor. The computer is the smartest thing youll ever see. All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your facebook, twitter, or myspace and tell them your running late. It's @DATE1, no one writes letters anymore; there's e-mail and instant messaging. Letters take forever to write and if you mess up you have to start over. When you type, all you do is hit ""backspace"" and you write over only your mistake. Letters also take forever to recieve, while instant messeges come, well, instantly! Haven't seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are being made with webcams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be talking with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor.

"Computers are great technology, but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives! Computers cause children to fail and lose their exercize. The children also put their self in danger by joining a few different websites. Don’t waste your time in a boring computer screen! I am almost @PERCENT1 positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their back packs in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. My mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @CAPS1, when he would only go one @NUM1 minutes a day to talk to family members. Now, my mom created a @CAPS1, that @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was gona only go on to with the family, but @CAPS2 plays all the pointless applications, such as, ""cafe world."" @CAPS2 waste her time on @CAPS1 whenever @CAPS2 is home, when @CAPS2 could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. Something I havent mentioned is, I use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didnt go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I relized after I got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. My dad then disconected my @CAPS4, and I beleive my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconecting the @CAPS4, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @CAPS3 home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, ""blogtv.com."" were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing! Stop wasting your life people! Go out and have fun, dont let the @CAPS4 keep you home.

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 your computer daily can be a waste of your life. Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercsing and enjoying nature, distract you from human nature things such as communicating, and can also waste tons of energy. Picture yourself, sitting at your desk, talking to some friends online. Take away your computer and all youre doing is sitting thhere, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, [expect your fingers of ] @CAPS2't you think you should be doing something more usefull in your life? Such as taking a walk and enjoying nature? That's what I thought. Nature is beautiful. So @CAPS4 enjoy it throug h a window next to your desk? obesity is a problem in @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are considered ""fat"" @CAPS4 would you even think about spending your day simply sitting in a chair? Go to the gym and loose some of that extra body weight! Communicating through @CAPS5's is so over-rated, people can't express their emotions! all they can do is send a smily face or happy face. Communication wih only your friends can cause you to miss out on things. For example, lets say there is a cancelation at your work place on the news, but you @CAPS2't see it cause you were @CAPS6-ing with your friend. @CAPS6? @PERCENT2 of people @CAPS2't even ""laugh out loud"" @CAPS7 they send that to their friends. Plus you @MONTH1 even go to your friends, house and instead of laughing, you'l say @CAPS6. Are instead of gasping, you say, ""@CAPS9!"" I mean come on people, get out and really ""communicate"" @CAPS10, so you bought one of those new lights? Too bad youre not even saving any energy by @CAPS1 that computer of yours daily. @CAPS1 that @CAPS11, uses about the same amount of energy in as @NUM1 regular light bulbs in @NUM2 hours, @CAPS12 that light really saving you that much money. Haven't you heard? the economy is bad, which means we @CAPS2't have alot of money which means YOU playing online games is wasting energy, which is wasting money. Someones going to have to work overtime this week, and it's not me. I @CAPS2't think hair spray is the cause of the layer being destroyed... Computers are bad, and dont have a good enough reason to be used. They take enjoying nature, reduse your communication levels, and not to mention, waste a lot of energy.

"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy a lot of people's time which could be used for other matters. The internet also contains alot of unappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many petafiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in america is climbing. There is no doubt that electronics, play a huge role in this event. For example my brother plays on the computer everyday, so barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also there is alot of content. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornagraphy. most sites don't even alert you that by how you need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very little acctually ask for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children as a young teens. Its truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and. Petafiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive, to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location, and to commit rape. Some victims are enough speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet. For these reasons I say that computers have a negative effect computers lives because some positive but sadly cons outweight pros such as before mention occupation of time, content on the internet. I truly believe that the planet would be better with out computers..He received his B.A. in Biochemistry, summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1980 and his Ph.D. in Biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985 under the mentorship of the gene therapy pioneer Richard C.

Once your child finally cooperates they will get the to use the computer. As you can see there are meny things to do on the computer from talking to far away friends to making new friends a computer schedule.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren't even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, ""where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment..Technology analyst Om Malik wrote in May 1998 how Starlight software helped power Bloomberg Television and Starlight partnered with RealNetworks to enable Web conferencing at Smith Barney..Techno-animism is a culture of technological practice where technology is imbued with human and spiritual characteristics..454 Life Sciences was a biotechnology company based in Branford, Connecticut that specialized in high-throughput DNA sequencing..The company offers an app called Numbrs that aggregates bank account and credit card information and facilitates mobile banking and personal financial planning..Highland provides technology-based instruction across the curriculum..John E.

"Computers, a @LOCATION1 topic if you ask me. Sure they arnt very good for you dosn't mean if you use it correctly then it can be a souce of life. Computers are helpful in many ways, they can be an information post. The social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world. During school kids have projects and without computers. Read on as I will explain in details. Computers, as you know, are one of the worlds greatest information posts. @NUM1 out of ten people survayed said that the computers are a value of everyday life, The earthquake in haiti is recovalng now, but half the world wouldnt know that with out computers so have a heart, and dont take away the most valued info in the world. Secondly, what would you say if I told, you that kids are more socialy retarded than ever! Well its true. Over @NUM2 of the worlds people rely on intractive websites to comunicate with each other. Fact, children have more friends over the internet then ever. You dont want to be the @LOCATION1 in all this do yours ar know as the person who kept kids from living? I dont think so. Lastly, all people in school use computers to do projects, for instance @PERSON2 had horrible hand writing and this was the bigest project of the year. So he turned his computer to type it, he gets on at. But what if there was (@CAPS1) computer! @PERSON2 would have gotten a @CAPS2 - for the project. In fact teachers @CAPS3 wear tell kids to type hw/projects. @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 year kids pass my class by typing and if they then they would all flunk!"" @CAPS4 got the point but more importantly do you?! To sumit all up for those of you lazy enough to not read there story essay. Computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information. Makeing friends, or doing projects. So are you gonna be the person who sits back and lets that happen or are you going to get up and stop the maddness once and for all. Its you choice but think of the socity retarded, dumb kids that fail the grade @CAPS3 year..Paula Brown is a Canadian science researcher, currently at British Columbia Institute of Technology..In this setting, interstellar travel is a new technology and requires human space travelers to be transplanted into cyborg bodies..The Auburn Speedster was an American car, manufactured by the Auburn Automobile Company of Auburn, Indiana..He is responsible for covering energy issues, new media, commercial space travel, and the impact technology is having on humans..His current research interests span over the main topics important for Semantic Web technology, including knowledge management, ontology management and semantic web services..Ishaq Khan Khakwani completed his BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore in 1971 and worked as an engineer in Pakistan Railways for 18 years before entering the political arena."
"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. .As the first project in Italy to abandon the automobile-derived design and adopt a comprehensive ""rolling stock"" approach, it represents the link between the simple and sturdy Littorine and the modern Diesel units..Insight Technology, Inc. is an optical device manufacturer based in Londonderry, New Hampshire..At 2:38 a.m. on June 11, 1978, the freighter Chavez rammed the West Seattle Bridge over the Duwamish West Waterway, thereby closing it to automobile traffic for the next six years..Google Street View is a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth that provides panoramic views from positions along many streets in the world..Pruitt was counsel for McClatchy from 1984 to 1987, corporate Secretary and General Counsel from 1987 to 1998, publisher for the Fresno Bee from 1991 to 1994, general counsel from 1987 to 1991, and Vice President, Operations and Technology from 1991 to 1994..The city grew around the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the Southern Railway of Mississippi and developed a largely rail-based economy."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers. This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are making a great impact! Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. This is useful in daly life all the time! Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented at things requiring their hands (like baseball or basket ball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too. Something as simple as driving a car doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in hand-eye coordination computers bring. This is a fantastic effect that computers have on people. In addition to the hand-eye coordination computers teach, they also help you learn about faraway places and people. This splendid information is easier to aquire thanks to the technowlogy of computers. ""@CAPS2 I didn't use my laptop for my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report,"" says @PERSON1, and @NUM1 grade student, "" I would never finish. Books take so long and I learned so much about my topic from my computer!"" @CAPS2 you are going on vacation, You can easily research your destination's location and culture with this advanced search engine. Why wouldn't you use a computer when you learn so much from them? Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other. They have lots of ways to video chat, @CAPS6 message, and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with. ""I had to move away from my best friend last @DATE1,"" says @PERSON3, resident of @LOCATION1, ""With my computer we can still talk to each other and stay friends."" computers are definatly a great way to communicate with friends and family. Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people; and even allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing! Ask yourself this, how would computers have a positive effect in your life?.Prior to his career in film, he studied BSc Multimedia Technology & Design at Brunel University London and MA Magazine Journalism at City University London before working as Online Editor for British weekly trade newspaper Music Week..The duPont Registry is an American brand name of print classified advertising publications specializing in luxury automobiles, real estate and yachts..Dlshad Othman is a Kurdish Syrian activist and information technology specialist in information security who provides Syrians with digital security resources and assistance so that they can utilize online communications and advocacy freely and securely in spite of increased online government repression in the form of censorship, sophisticated cyber attacks, and intense surveillance..He went to the Guitar Institute of Technology..It specializes in the creation of high end luxury goods for technology items, such as ""luxury computers"", iPad and iPhone decorations and baggage..Led by Jan Holsteijn and primarily concentrated in Spijkenisse, Mobile Netherlands primarily advocates for improvement of government-owned or regulated mobility and transport facilities."
"Dear Newspaper I think that computers were one @ORGANIZATION1 the best things ever created. They allow you to talk to people in far away places, help you learn about career and education choises, and you are able to learn about many subjects. Computers are here to help society not hurt it so why shouldn'y we use them? With @CAPS5 we can talk to people around the world or in space @CAPS2 that matter. You might not know it hut all @ORGANIZATION1 the communications in the world need a @CAPS5. There not the kind anyone could go out and but though. There satalites, the orbit the planet from space, @PERSON1, a proffesor at @ORGANIZATION1, told students at @ORGANIZATION3 that, ""A lot @ORGANIZATION1 every day items, such as rars and phones, all use some kind @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5."" @CAPS1 computers let people communicate with each other. In addition to letting people communicate they help millions @ORGANIZATION1 people make educational and career choises. Most kids that go to college don't know a lot @ORGANIZATION1 colleges out there. When my sister was picking what college she wanted to go to she didn't know which one to choose. She sat down and looked up hundred @ORGANIZATION1 schools. after narrowing it down she had made her decision she had picked @ORGANIZATION4, a @ORGANIZATION3 she had never even heard @ORGANIZATION1 a couple months ago. People are in this type @ORGANIZATION1 situation all the time at @ORGANIZATION2 a survey was taken by all the students to see what they wanted their career to be, @CAPS2 the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the week students got to experience diffrent carrer options. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the students picked a different carrer after that one week. Have you ever heard the old aget ""@CAPS3 is power""? well its true and computers are a great source @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3. they have many different subjects math, science, history language and much much more. people should be using this @CAPS3 at the @CAPS4 francisco national debate @PERSON2. Said that ""@CAPS5 are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places math. and even comunicating these are what computers should be used @CAPS2 not unhealthy games. You can learn about many new places with a @CAPS5. In @NUM1 grade my teacher had everyone do areport on a country me and my friend found this place we had both never heard @ORGANIZATION1. with the @CAPS5 we found onts @ORGANIZATION1 information on it such us its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts surely one would agree that a @CAPS5 is a great tool that should be used. It lots people communicate, helps in educational decisions, and you can learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a @CAPS5..The HTML500 is Canada's largest educational technology event, having taught thousands of Canadians how to code since its inception..The company produces a variety of ice cream that is distributed in supermarkets, convenience stores, food services and mobile hawkers all over Malaysia..It specializes in mobile advertising and digital production..Former GM automotive brands include Daewoo, McLaughlin, Oakland, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Hummer, Saab, Saturn, as well as Vauxhall and Opel..He is an ARC Australian Laureate Professor and Chair of Environmental Sustainability at the University of Tasmania in the Faculty of Science, Engineering & Technology..The 3GPP and WAP groups fostered the development of the MMS standard, which is now continued by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)."
