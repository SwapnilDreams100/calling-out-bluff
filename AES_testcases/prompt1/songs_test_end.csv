"Dear local newspaper, I think effects computers have on people are great learning skills/affects because they give us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe(astronomy) and keeps us out of troble! Thing about! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever time to chat with your friends or buisness partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace ect. Just think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidde in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Rather than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or child because it gives us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of troble. Thank you for listening..Just like a dunce in the eighth grade,   You'll soon be an old maid,   School teacher, rule creature, cool creature, school teacher..He hit the ground running,   At the speed of light..I'm doing very well   I can block out the present and the past now   I know by now you think I should have   Straightened myself out -

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail ""@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not posible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you amagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most buissness, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the castomer's convinence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her resturant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 wer not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there..Mrs. Blaileen - she was a sixth grade teacher   And she controlled the children   By using humiliation..Never in my life have I seen someone   So fucking blind to the damage he has done,   You're the rotted root in the family tree..Chorus:   And he covers for her and she covers for him   If it's wild and they want to they will   But the dangers are real and the chances are slim   And there ain't nothing cheap but the thrill   In the badlands of beverly hills..Why can't I see it straight?.Painted lady, nobody's child, you have set me free..On days like these, on days like these....oh, yeah!.So I just want to clear the air   I already know, and darlin' I still care,   But we're hurtin' from your lovin' on the side      I'm not saying that I approve, or that I can stand it,   But I know I've got to give us one more try..No sleep 'til Fuckneckville, it's kind of funny you may not realize it until   Phone call stop, can't get laid, you find out where the parties were some time the next day      One way ticket to seclusion, now your losin'   One way ticket to alienation, you're an inside joke      Is everybody supposed to be impressed with your ability to make us feel less significant than you   We're all chippin' in the purchase you a one way first class ticket outta town      Millions sold, a mega star, there's a million assholes with ten million guitars   Enjoy it now, soon it ends, suddenly you find yourself without any friends      One way ticket to isolation, you can hang with you   You've been given a citation for excessive social faux pas and obnoxiousness      Go ahead keep telling us your fifteen-minute stories about what you had for breakfast then for lunch   We're all chippin' for one big humble pie, we're gonna smash it in your face   Go ahead tell us about your last great sold out concert and how your new record's gonna top the charts   We don't care 'bout your expenses, we just wanna have a laugh at your expense.Oh, whatever you need of me   I've made up my mind   I'll give you more than you've asked for      And there are those who can foresee   Where we will go   All the future....It's alright we told you what to dream..My   Dirty desire?.I'm about to take it up a notch, so watch what I'm about to do..We can talk about it then   'Cause I've had a drink too many   And my troubles, well I ain't got any      Why can't it wait 'til daylight?.Heard about Pittsburgh, P. A.?.When a man loves a woman,   Can't keep his mind on nothing else..Someday I will make it right..Despite all those things that they said you had done   You had me believin' now that I was the one   In your dreams, instead of your schemes..I used to shout   Across the room to you   And you'd come dancin'   Like a fool   Shuffle step   You funky mother   Come to me   All warm as covers      Rest with me   My lovely brother   For you see   There is no other   Memory so sad and sweet   I'll see you soon   Save me a seat      Well I'm cryin'   Now my lovely man   Yes I'm cryin'   Now and no one can   Ever fill the   The hole you left my man   I'll see you later   My lovely man if I can      In my room   I'm all alone   Waiting for you   To get home      Listen to Roberta Flack   But I know you won't come back      Well I'm cryin'   Now my lovely man   Yes I'm cryin'      Just in case   You never knew   I miss you slim      I love you too   See my heart   It's black and blue   When I die   I will find you      Well I'm cryin'   Now my lovely man   Yes I'm cryin'   Now and no one can   Ever fill the   The hole you left my man   I'll see you later   My lovely man if I can.Got some pretty little women there, I'm gonna get me one..I spend my days just mooning, so sad and blue, so sad and blue   I spend my nights just mooning, all over you (all over who?)"
"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and ""boom,"" instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, ""@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future..Aerials, so up high,   When you free your eyes,   Eternal prize..Status seekers - I never cared   Once I found out they never dared   To seize the world and shake it upside down   And every stinking bum should wear a crown      Sayin' I cry for love   Till all the plates are broken   Cry for love   Until my eyes are soakin'   Yeah cry for love   On every salmon mornig   Cry for love   'cause imitation's boring   Cry for love      bad tv that insults me freely   Still I know what I'm dyin' to see   In searching for a meaningful embrace   Sometimes my self-respect took second place      an' I cried for love   I did what my heart told me   Cried for love   Can't stand it   When they scold me   Yeah I cried for love   On every salmon morning   Yeah I cry for love   'cause imitation's boring   Cry for love      Surfers ride for love and wipe out when it hits 'em   Soldiers kill for love and nobody admits it   If you're cryin' for love well, that's ok don't sweat it   If you're cryin' for love then there's still a chance you'll get it   Cry for love.Winter is here again oh lord,   Haven't been home in a year or more   I hope she holds on a little longer   Sent a letter on a long summer day   Made of silver, not of clay   I've been runnin' down this dusty road      Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'   I don't know where I'll be tomorrow   Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'      I've been trying to make it home   Got to make it before too long   I can't take this very much longer   I'm stranded in the sleet and rain   Don't think I'm ever gonna make it home again   The mornin' sun is risin'   It's kissin the day      Oh the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'   I don't' know where I'll be tomorrow   Ooo the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.Running scared   Wonderin' what I'm doing so far from home   Pretending not to care   That I was so alone   Then my eyes met hers   And without one word   I could tell what was gonna happen   I could feel it in my bones      By the dark of the moon   There's a fire in the night   She took me to her room   Ah you know it felt so right   It keeps growing higher   The flame of desire   By the dark of the moon   Ah there's a fire in the night      Well she told me   She didn't often do this kind of thing   She said please hold me   Hold me tight so I don't have to think   Oh her gentle touch   Really moved me so much   The flames of love swept over us   Like a burning light      By the dark of the moon   There's a fire in the night   She took me to her room   Ah you know it felt so right   It keeps growing higher   The flame of desire   By the dark of the moon   Mm there's a fire in the night   (Fire in the night)      By the dark of the moon   There's a fire in the night   She took me to her room   Ah you know it felt so right   It keeps growing higher   The flame of desire   By the dark of the moon   Oh there's a fire in the night      There's a fire in the night   We started a fire   Oh      There's a fire in the night   Oh I'm on fire.I'm lookin' for one new value   I'm lookin' for one new value   But nothing comes my way..Ok.

"I agree that computers deffinately are an advantage to our society. I think this because they help us communicate and video chat with family and friends online, used as a great tool with school work, or work purposes. Most of all for the enjoyment of children and now the fun computer games help them prepare for real life consequences,like how the game webkinz teaches kids to care for pets. ""@CAPS1 you have a @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5. ""@CAPS6, please friend request me"", I replied. Later that night, I get home and check my @CAPS2, a new notification pops up and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My entire family is on @CAPS2 and I think it's so usefull for several reasons, like making plans and parties. I hate writing invitations, but now every year for my birthday party I just type them up, taking less than five minutes. Or, for an even simpler way of sending invatations you can even just type an email or @CAPS2 message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over @CAPS2. It's so easy, you just create an event and tag all of your friends in the note. Also, it's so easy to get @CAPS13's because you automatically get notified. Technology like this drastically makes life easier. For example, have you ever gotten something new and just can't wait to show your friends? Well, now you can, in the comfort of your own home. All you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too. ""@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!"" I said. ""@CAPS15 you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty,"" says @PERSON1. I love webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were in the same exact you. As you can see, webcamming is so much easier than spending more time money, and my moms time and getting a ride over her house. Computers make life so much more convienent. Another example how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand writing and most kids won't like writing it anyways. Like myself, I type faster than I write and that's why I agree @PERCENT1 that computers benefit society. Most importantly, computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you. How impressive would that be? If I was applying for a professional position of a job, I know I'll type my resume. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, beneficial, important and fun to our society..Chop!.The price that the United States must pay is the price of its own destruction!"".Girls on the

Sitting down to a composition   Test the limits of your inhibition   If the phone hasn't rung by midnight   It's over tonight      If someone tried, you'd realise   It's just a boy or a girl   It's not the end of the world      Piles of toast and broken promises   Among the books and pens and reading glasses   It seems there's no escape from the humdrum   It's over and done      If someone tried, you'd realise   It's just a boy or a girl   It's not the end of the world   If someone cried, you'd sympathise   It's just a boy or a girl   It's not the end of the world      At midnight in desperation   Imagine total teenage destruction      The Prophets all predicted extinction   The Virgin spoke in apparitions   And if it all came to pass now   You feel we'd all deserve it somehow      But if someone tried (you'd realise)   You'd realise (and sympathize)   It's just a boy or a girl   It's not the end of the world   If someone cried (you'd sympathize)   You'd sympathise (and

"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one..Gotta' find me a better day..Thought control!.so long as me and Howard and Jeff get credit for special material, there's some bad ground acid..Please tell someone   Everything is gone   Dream less of me, less to guess on you   I felt so much   Every tick and tussle   Heart torn because it's a kissin' time..Every day seems a little longer, in every way my love's a little stronger..And makes me wanna never leave?.If you hear this message, wherever you stand   I'm calling every woman, calling every

of darkness.And then we kiss   Your love comes alive on my lips   I feel the rush   Coming over me, over me   And when we touch   This moment when everything's still   I close my eyes   And then we kiss      And then we kiss (x2)   And when we touch   This moment when everything's still   I close my eyes   And then we kiss.Show me a sign to let me know   Yeah, yeah..I'm sick with the rhymes I've just said   Don't mind my face its a little red..There has to be a place for you and me   Where we can sleep and waters still run deep   And you're the one that sails into me   And you're the one whose lips are silent   You're the one that always said   There's only one forever   It brought us both together,   There's only one forever   You said to me, just give me honesty   And in return, I'll build your santuary   Long ago, that path was chosen   How could we not fall in love   Remember when we always said   There's only one forever   It brought us both together   There's only one forever   You're the one that sails into me   You're the one whose lips are silent   You're the one that always said   There's only one forever   There's only one forever   It brought us both together   There's only one forever.Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart..Darlin' I don't know much..Yeah!.Good thing, got yourself a good thing, It's a good thing..Whole lotta love, tons!.Go on and dump the dude

" I think computers are good because you can talk to your friends and family on the computers. People needs computers to look for a job. Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop..[Chorus:]   And He walks with me, and He talks with me,   And He tells me I am His own,   And the joy we share as we tarry there,   None other has ever known..You take a step in the right direction,   But the man knocks us down on the floor,   And although he may think we are broken,   We'll get up and take two steps more..'t Was on the Isle of Capri that I found her   Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree   Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her   Where we met on the Isle of Capri      She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning   But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me   And though I sailed with the tide in the morning   Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri      Summertime was nearly over   Blue Italian sky above   I said ""Lady, I'm a rover,   Can you spare a sweet word of love?"".I'll be moving on down the road pretty baby, oh, to start all over again..Basis all for me,   Can you leave my mind..Girls' school      Head nurse is sister scala   Now she's a Spanish doll   She runs a full body out call massage parlour   From the teacher's hail      Ah...

"Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at @TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're changing too, so you @MONTH1 be off to college or have to move far away for buissness. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye."" my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?.Nick's version is also available..[Repeat Chorus]   [Verse Two:]   [All]   He's got the flava to do his his thang,   He's got something everybody wish they had,   [Kandi]   And something tells me you don't want to make him mad,   No you don't, no you don't, no you don't..Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf!.It's hard to be a snail   Who wants to hit the trail   But when your house is on your tail   It's hard to see!.Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high   (from this point on it only gets rougher!).This time I'm walking through fire   Did I say that?.We go dancing, and everything is fine,   We're romancing, the music is divine,   Then the band starts to syncopate,   You jump from thirty three to seventy eight..Stop   You better stop!.The stars are laughing at us,   As we crawl on and on past lovers who'll leap..Like a plague your lies spread   Fast across the world   Mastering the art of deception   That increases your sick addition   It's an overactive imagination   That enslaves your empty shell.Tell me what you really want from life,   Loving you, darling,   You got me infatuated,   Good love is not for sale,   I nearly gave myself away..In the wind, Lord, in the wind,   Make me a home out in the wind..Is this not a riddle?.They yell back ""one dollar""   I wipe all the dead bugs   And dirt off their windshield   And connect my big hose   Up to their gas tank   The gas hums as it enters   And fulls up their empty tank   I do two at a time now   I've developed a technique   My timing is very good   If not always precise   I give them a fair deal   They drive off satisfied   We need each other's business   Without which we could not survive   We like to trade money-   Because it means honor,   Not like those people   Who are sick and can't touch it   Because they're unhealthy,   They leave me cold..Won't you remember?.Where were my senses?.So what you coming round for baby?.Just moving out of her sensitive phase..(Can't be stopped! ).I find   Here in my eyes, my heart and my mind   Your sexy smile   Your sense of style   Your kiss!.Wind, that speaks to the leaves   Telling stories that no one believes ."
"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across the world. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned. Such as, hand-eye cordination. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world. Celebraties are very popular on computers or other technologies. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies. Anything you can get on any other technologies. There is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. If we did not have phones to use to call someone. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years. You can look images or videos that you haven't seen in years. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers. I wonder what it will be like?.Did you think you were buying safety   When you bought that piece of ground?.That's it.etc!.Who was fitted with bridle and bit?.[Chorus:Repeat x2]   Shout   Shout   Let

to know   Those one track minds   That took you for a working boy   Kiss them goodbye   You shouldn't have to jump for joy   You shouldn't have to shout for joy      [Chorus]      They gave you life   And in return you gave them hell   As cold as ice   I hope we live to tell the tale   I hope we live to tell the tale      [Chorus:Repeat x2]      And when you've taken down your guard   If I could change your mind   I'd really love to break your heart   I'd really love to break your heart      [Chorus].I'm Gonna Get You   I'm Gonna   Buy You A Little Horse   You Can Ride   You Can Play All Day   My Little Child   We're Gonna Go   Out The Fields Tonight   You'll Be Brave   You'll Be Strong One Day      Chorus:   Life Is Hard Enough Babe   Try To See Things My Way   Life Is Hard Enough Babe   Can't You See It In My Face      And Now I See I'm Not   The Girl I Used To Be   Times Have Changed   Where's The Mercy   And Grace   More And More There's No   Light Inside Of Me   All The Pain All

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1! I am an @NUM1 grade student at @PERSON1. I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benifit society. i completly disagree with these comments. let me explain... Having computers definatly benifits for all students. Sometimes kids forget their text books at school. But if they have a computer, they can just google the information. That way they get there homework done, and don't have to take a zero. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called, study island. If you havn't, i'ts a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an @CAPS2 on study island we get an @CAPS2 in one of our classes.. Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no instructions in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called synewnisia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. The piano helps my hand-eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication. Now, synewnesia isn't the only free instrument learning program. There are many others! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you acheive things later in life. Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completly true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well one day when I went on google the top search of the day was, ""weight watchers diet plan"". Also, my mom uses an online video workout website, for her bad back. So not only does the computer help for diets, they can help physical therapy also. So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benifite our society, yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But, online learning sessions can be time consuming. It helps many people figure out the right deit and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy..Yeah, that's my bodyguard   Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security   What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate   If you want it come and get it, you know I stay super straight   Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin' Out the Super 8   Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate   Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah I got that super cake   Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait      [Chorus: x2]   I put on for my city, on on for my city   I put on for my city, on on for my city   Put on (east side) Put on (south side) Put on (west side) Put on      [Verse 2: Young Jeezy]   Half bag, top back,   Ain't nothin' but a young thug   HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club   Big wheels, big straps,   You know I like it super sized   Passenger's a red-bone,   Her Weave look like some curly fries   Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce   Pocket full of celery,   Imagine what she tellin' me   Blowin' on asparagus,   The realest shit I ever smoked   Ridin' to that Trap or Die,   The realest shit I ever wrote   They know I got that broccoli,   So I keep that glock on me   Don't get caught without one,   Comin' from where I'm from   Call me Jeezy Hamilton,   Flyin' down Campbellton   So fresh, so clean,   On my way to Charlene      [Chorus: x2]      I put on, I put on, I put on   I put on for my city, I put on for my   I put on for my city, I put on for my city, on      I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks   I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex   I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress   I lost the only girl in the world that know me best   I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit   I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit   Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace   Sure I need just at least one of Russell's nieces on   I let my nightmares go I put on,   Everybody that I knew from the go   I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke   They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more   You got that big fame homie, and you just changed on me   You can ask big homie, man the top so lonely   I ain't lyin', so lonely I ain't lyin'   Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)   I'm high as a satellite (satellite)   I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)   Cause every night (every night) I put on      [Chorus: x2]      Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)   I'm high as a satellite (satellite)   I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)   Cause every night (every night)   Let me see what we have tonight   I'm high as a satellite   I see those flashin' lights.But I couldn't make it through until there was you..Look yourself in the eye before you drown..Never been to England, never been to France   Never really learned how to dance   I've never taken dope and I've never taken drugs   Ah, I've never danced on a bear-skin rug   Guess it's true, what all the people they say   I'm gonna have to loose my hometown ways   Guess it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life      Never went around with anything   I've had a hometown life   And I have never learned to swing   Not much of a life, I haven't seen much   I've been true to my wife and it's just been too much   Guess it's true, what all these people they say   I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways   You know it's true, guess, I've led a sheltered life      Guess it's true, what all these people they say   I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways   Guess it's true, guess, I've led a sheltered life.Boy racer   Boy racer, oh   We're gonna kill this pretty thing   Boy racer   Boy racer, oh   We're gonna kill this pretty thing.A steady hand to lead me through   Arms of faith to bring me back to you!.I'm willing to pretend, one more time   I got some life to spend, on even rhymes   But when I reach the end, will you (will you) will you be mine?.A little crime of passion   Is takin' my breath away   Show me some mercy   What a fool I've become   A little crime of passion   That's what I'm sufferin' from   Baby, oh, just a little crime of passion   What I'm sufferin' from   What I'm sufferin' from   What I'm sufferin' from   Oh, just a little crime of passion   Is what I'm sufferin' from.All my old friends think I got a new crowd..I guess not, oh I guess not      Do you even know who you are?.It's a modern life   But it's not what you're looking for..having trouble comprehending I was sure that I was who I thought I was and if you want the truth then I blame them I blame you and I blame myself in all this pomp and circumstance I failed to see that I had missed my chance without a word to say I waited as you turned and walked away.Grave your victory?.May lady lullaby sing plainly for you soft, strong, sweet and true..Could you dare to find my key?.Lonely hearts in distress..Surely this can't be heaven   Though it feels like I died   I guess it's just goodbye then   There's nowhere left to hide   Can't you see you have the power      To make or break my day   I'm getting weaker by the hour   All the time you stay away      I'm so in alone I feel so lonely   Here on my own I've lost my way   I never dream't that it could hurt like this, boy   Lost in the absence of your precious kiss   Why do I feel this pain   Loves just a dangerous game      So where do I go from here   What do I have to do   Something to make you realize   Just how I feel for you      Don't you see you have the power   To make or break my day   I'm getting weaker by the hour   Do you hear me when I say      I'm so in alone I feel so lonely   Here on my own I've lost my way   I never dreamt that it could hurt like this, boy   Lost in the absence of your precious kiss   Why do I feel this pain   Loves just a dangerous game      But the feeling still remains   And the embers feed the flame   How I hope you feel the same   So I love will grow again      It's only you see you have the power   To make or break my day   I'm getting weaker by the hour   Can't you hear me say   I can't face the world today      I'm so in alone I feel so lonely   Here on my own I've lost my way   I never dreamt that it could hurt like this, boy   Lost in the absence of your precious kiss   Why do I feel this pain   Loves just a dangerous game.I love my customers..It ain't that I'm wantin'   Anything you never gave before..Into the mercy seat I climb   My head is shaved, my head is wired   And like a moth that tries   To enter the bright eye   I go shuffling out of life   Just to hide in death awhile   And anyway I never lied..Then I spend it all at the Omaha mall."
"You @MONTH1 find this hard to beleive, but many people think computers put a negative attitude on people. Now you @MONTH1 be saying thats not true, that everyone has a computer, but the truth is they don't and they believe it puts negative attitude on people. People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends. Did you @CAPS5 some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from differnt states who live far away. For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can make a connection because I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that I use to stay in contact with family friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I @CAPS5 that many people want to learn about people from differnt countries and this is one way to do it right now I am learning some new things about the @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. While on this wonderful adventure of learning you @MONTH1 even get yourself into a vacation adventure. A recent test was taking stating that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't @CAPS5 where. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature.These people are wrong if one is on a computer and they are chating with someone from a differnt state or country then that person might persuade them to take a visit there. For example they would be able to go to the internet type in the place they want to visit and get photographs and information about the place. As a result, people would still get to enjoy nature. Sometimes using the computer could be educational. Many people @MONTH1 disagree with that statement but its true. For example when on the computer many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @MONTH1 affect their work scheduale. This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studing. It would also help them on their reports. For example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to. As a result, the students grades would increase. I hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind. As a result for those who didn't agree with the statement that they are positive not negative I hope that you will redecide on your opion..Little German boy   Being pushed around   Little German boy

"Do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer? People are spending too much time on computers. Obesity is a growing problem in today's society, people need to interact with eachother, and we need to get some fresh air. Computer are ruining these things for people. Unplug yourself from your computer. More and more people are becoming obese. This is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. To our whole life, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face. Get out and get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Bring out on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most. Fresh air clear your mind. Time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to releave stress so go outside. Click turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friendsand family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing. People are wasting too much time on their computers and it's flushing our society down the toilet, so just turn off your computer..What am I supposed to do with this time   It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I'm   Feel out of control, so petrified   I'm petrified      What am I supposed to do to get by   Did I lose everything I need to survive   'Cause its 4 a.m. and the sweat sets in   Did you get my message, did it send   Or did you just get on with your life, oh      I've taken time to think and I   Don't think it's fair for us to   Turn around and say goodbye   I have this feeling when I   Finally found the words to say   But I can't tell you   If you turn around and run away, run away      What am I supposed to do with these clothes   It's my twisted way of keep you close   I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man   Did you get my message, did it send   Or do you get along on your own, oh      I've taken time to think and I   Don't think it's fair for us to   Turn around and say goodbye   I have this feeling when I   Finally found the words to say   But I can't tell you   If you turn around and run away, run away      And it breaks me down when I see your face   You look so different but you feel the same   And I do not understand, I cannot comprehend   The chills your body sends, why did it have to end      I've taken time to think and I   Don't think it's fair for us to   Turn around and say goodbye   I have this feeling that I   Finally found the words to say   But I can't tell you   If you turn around and run away, run away      I've taken time to think and I   Don't think it's fair for us to   Turn around and say goodbye   And I have this feeling that I   Finally found the words to say   But I can't tell you   If you turn around and run away, run away      Runaway, runaway   Turn around and runaway, runaway   Runaway, runaway   But I can't tell you if you runaway, runaway   Turn around and runaway.Will he remember the lesson of giving?.As someone long prepared for this to happen,   Go firmly to the window..Also it is whispered   In the kingdom far and wide,   To beware a little cottage   In the forest in a glade..Hey Teresa, I saw you in school today   This is what I got to say   Mmm, you're a honey, worth more to me than money   Cuter to me than a rose-bud   I'll love you forever, if you'll be my girl   Oh, I'm gonna ask you out   That's what I'm talkin' about   I wanna make a date, mmm, I'd better not wait   Hey Teresa, right away   You've got eyes that sparkle   Hair that's soft like an angel   I love you Teresa, Teresa, hope you'll be my girl.The game I just about conquered, it like Donkey Kong   I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit, I reign supreme in this honkey shit..Why, why, why   Oh ooh ohh      There you are, in a darkened room   And you're all alone, looking out the window   Your heart is cold and lost the will to love   Like a broken arrow   Here I stand in the shadows   In the shadows   Come to come, come to me   Can't you see that      Nobody wants to be lonely   Nobody wants to cry   My body's longing to hold you   So bad it hurts inside   Time is precious and it's slipping away   And I've been waiting for you all of my life (ohh)   Nobody wants to be lonely   So why (why), why don't you let me love you      Why (ooh ohh yeah), why (oh why), why      Ooh ooh, yeah   Can you hear my voice, do you hear my song   It's a seranade, so your heart can find me, ohh   And suddenly you're flying down the stairs   Into my arms, baby, ohh      Before I start going crazy   Going crazy, ohh   Run to me   Run to me   Cause I'm dying...

"Wouldnt it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country we can. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again. Looking at places far away is always an option. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even going to different countries, even different continents is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plan tickets. reserve rooms, even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk. and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't see his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, facebook, myspce, skype, etc, is allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instint, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their, it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad?.Out of work and got no money,   A Sunday joint of bread and honey..Girl, I've been waitin' all night to see you dance like me   You gon' sweat your outfit, out trying to dance like me   (Now let me see)   Ah ah ah, freeze!.You can't live without the fire   It's the heat that makes you strong   'Cause you're born to live and fight it all the way   You can hide what lies inside you   It's the only thing you know   You're embracing that, never walk away   Don't walk away      You need not to fear us   unless you're a dark heart   a vile one, who preys on the innocent   I promise, you can't hide forever in the empty darkness   for we'll hunt you down   like the animals you are   and pull you in the very bowels of hell      Oh Damn, the war is coming!.You say you only trust what you can touch      All you got to do is reach out for it      All that you want   Is standing right in front of you   All that you need   Is love..I hear you!.You have danced with him since the music began..I'm going to sing my song   A song that never ends.Give me the clearest indication   I'm not alone with you      Reach out your hand   In a world I thought I knew   I need the clearest indication   The clearest indication from you      Did we have all we wanted   And let it slip away in time?.Another rainy morning   People rushing by   My head is still in the clouds   I dream with open eyes   Suddenly out of nowhere   She came into my life   Like we know each other   For quite a while      In the sound of silence   Time is standing still   There's some kind of bond between us   That's givin' me the chill   Do you really wonder   That we can burn the sky   It's written a thousand years ago   In the book of life      Are you the one that God had made for me   Are you the one who's always in my dreams   The one who keeps me goin'   When I can't go on   The one that I've been waiting for   For so long      Oh, yeah      Suddenly out of nowhere   She came into my life      Are you the one that God had made for me   Are you the one who's always in my dreams      Are you the one that God had made for me   Are you the one who's mine eternally   The one who keeps me dreamin'   When I'm sad and tired   Who gives my life a meaning   'Til the day I die      Are you the one   Are you the one.for the wicked   ???.Johnny: ""okay..Aces high..I put a sign up..I'm a have to floss on you   Let's get it blazin'   We can turn the heat up if you wanna   Turn the lights down low if you wanna   Just wanna move you   But you're frozen   That's what I'm saying      Let me break the ice   Allow me to get you right   But you warm up to me   Baby I can make you feel   Let me break the ice   Allow me to get you right   But you warm up to me   Baby I can make you feel      So you warming up yet?.Cause I'm yours   Why can't I say that I'm in love?.Look in the mirror, and what do you see?.Every time it's the same   What bothers me is my fame   You're what I need to play the game   You say you like to dance   Mmm, I think I'll take a chance   Ooh, baby, maybe it's time for romance   You're such a jewel in the rough   You wanna show me your stuff   For my money, you can't be too soon   Meet, meet you in the ladies room   Meet, meet you in the ladies room   For my money, you can't be too soon   You say you like to play   Well, it's too late for you to get away   And you've gotta believe me, when I say   Baby, you're such a jewel in the rough   You wanna show me your stuff   For my money, you can't be too soon   Meet, meet you in the ladies room   Meet, meet you in the ladies room   For my money, you can't be too soon   You can't be too soon   You're such a jewel in the rough   You wanna show me your stuff, come on baby   For my money, you can't be too soon      I'll meet you, greet you in the ladies room   For my money, you can't be too soon   Meet you, greet you in the ladies room   I'll meet you, greet you in the ladies room   For my money, you can't be too soon   Meet you, greet you in the ladies room   Mmm, meet, meet you in the ladies room      Meet, meet you in the ladies room   I'll meet you, greet you in the ladies room   For my money, you can't be too soon   I'll meet, meet you in the ladies room   I'll meet you, greet you in the ladies room   For my money, you can't be too soon   Meet, meet you in the ladies room.No no..""Walk beside the pony daddy, its my first ride."".Let It Snow!.Doesn't matter if we've gone too far."
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but @CAPS3 gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 friend wasn't the only person who learn hand-eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, ""@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people threw the internet."" @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than @NUM3 miles away from you? If you do, @CAPS2 a computer will solve your problem of communication. @CAPS1 friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, ""I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in @CAPS1 essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with @CAPS1 family."" I didn't want to tell you this, but i was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and i learned just like @LOCATION2 learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated..But you broke me down and put me wise..Respected, saluted   (Aaaaaaaaaah!).All the saints and sinners   They pay handsomely   MSCAE they

"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it does not effect on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family.

"Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some cridit insted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic..After you've eaten   I'm not hungry   Uh, we meant beaten      Silver stream, silvery scream      Oooooh, impossible concentration..Please don't be scared of me..Be the rain you remember fallin'   (Be the rain, be the rain)   Save the Planet for another day   (Be the rain, be the rain)   Be the river as it rolls along   (Be the rain, be the rain).Your cheatin' heart will make you weep,   You'll cry and cry, and try to sleep..There's never been a dance that's so easy to do,   It even makes you happy when you're feelin' blue..When I was younger, so much younger than today,   I never needed anybody's help in any way..Here she is, boys!.When you can have mine   I ain't askin' for no sacrifice   Baby your friends do not need to know!.Only you San Damiano,   Lady of the roses own   Only you San Damiano,   Far from here but close to home      I want you to go, same as me..Turn up the night!.Guess I could find somebody, too   But I don't want no one but you   How could you leave without regret   Am I that easy to forget?.Put me out like a cigarette, out like a cigarette..Make that change)   Stand up and lift yourself, now!.Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,   I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that..There's something missin',   But who will listen enough to do what it will take?.In through the kitchen where we used to laugh,   Smells of your cooking, sounds of the past   Somehow we got older, the air just got colder   That's when the fog rolls in!.So your best bet is to be straight with me..I just came flying through your door,   You didn't notice that your number had been called..Let's go up the ladder to the roof   Where we can be closer to heaven..Well, it's cold outside and it's not summer anymore   And so I have to go inside and shut the door..Long ago, far away   In a stable bare   Look and see, he sleeps so peacefully   As if the cold of night were never there   Bless all the little children   Whenever they may lay   Somewhere a child is sleeping   A child was born on christmas day."
"Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people..I love to Praise,   I love to lift Your Holy Name!.And you hang on, hang on, hang on   To the words of a liar..Amazing how we all want this life a little more everyday..I know that you love us!).No you don't understand..I won't pretend,   So baby take it or leave..Maybe I'm lost,   But I can't make the cost      Of the airfare..I won't say anything   I'm hiding in the pink   If I move would I break the spell   Or am I boring you      I can't feel anything   I think whatever you say   You took me riding on the big wheel   So I guess I'm happy now      And I'll stay with you   And I'll lay with you   And I'll always be there   Nothing will go wrong   Till something better comes along      So now you swallowed me   Come and finish off the rest of me   A good house a cactus life   Spent perfect days and sleepless nights whatever      And I'll stay with you   And I'll lay with you   And I'll always be there   Nothing will go wrong   Till something better comes along      And I 've lost my fingerprints   And I 've lost my sixth sense   But you just don't feel a thing   When the needles going in      And I'll stay with you   And I'll lay with you   And I'll always be there   Oh go nowhere   And I'll stay with you   Till something better comes along.....'Cause I'm gone, ooh, yeah!.(Yes)   But it taught me before a decision ask this question first:      [Chorus]   Who am I living for?.And in the cold night, under the street light,   I long for your embrace..So, Happy Valentine's Day (Hey!).Down town the young ones are growing..Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky..Broken wings don't arrive..In the dead of night   She could shine a light   On some places that you've never been   In that kind of light   You could lose your sight   And believe there was something to win   You could hold her tight   With all your might   But she'd slip through your arms like the wind   And be back in flight   Back into the night   Where you might never see her again   The longer I thought I could find her   The shorter my vision became   Running in circles behind her   And thinking in terms of the blame   But she couldn't have been any kinder   If she'd come back and tried to explain   She wasn't much good at saying goodbye--but   That girl was sane.Why did fate deceive me?.Where have I gone wrong?.Come down, come down      And I know our time is fading   And I know you're here to save me   I've been patiently waiting   It's alright, it's alright, it's alright   I know we're up and fading   And I know there is no escaping   I've been patiently waiting It's alright, it's alright it's all      Trap me up, you're up in my face   Tomorrow's a bribe, tomorrow's a bribe, tomorrow's not today   So I don't want to fall on time   And I don't to feel alive   Will everybody trip?.Break it down again..Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?"
"Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should stop using Computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, bad for the younger kids, and teens could be, talking to someone they don't know. Lexi @NUM1, says that ""she has goting facebook texts to her cell phone of other teenage kids that are excuset"". @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population teenagers have @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 chat. Any of these websites can ford photos to their mobile device. This has goting out of the hand and what ever is on the computer now will be on forever. More childern under the age of @NUM3 years old are on the computer know. Where there are chat rooms were they can interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 is a childerns game that has a chating interaction, were you can talk to who ever. But, we you create this @PERSON1 you child has to give a parents email address were they have to read the following terms to chose for their child. But, most parents don't even read it . @PERCENT2 of these parents just agree to these terms and don't even read them. @PERSON2, was followed home from soccer practice when a man about @NUM4"" and around the age of @NUM5 said ""@PERSON2 come get some candy"" @PERSON2 said ""how do you know my name""? ""@CAPS5 said cause I play with you all the time"" @PERSON2 quickly ran home and @CAPS5 told his parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6 another intraction game and told this stranger @CAPS5 lives in @LOCATION2 field and @CAPS5 goes to @LOCATION2 @CAPS7. Giving strangers you information they can trace you down and find the street you live on. We need to keep our children safe and off of the computers more so sexting, and young children stay off, so kidnapping stops. Help @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 to become a safe place for our childern..""Bad Ass"" on draught, and big Ford trucks   We spend the day on the line and the nights lit up   We rock blue jeans, tees, old English D's   So baby you best to believe that's how we do it in detroit   That's how we do it in detroit,   Up in the d, d, d      We're the real deal trick, 'bout as real as it gets   We don't pay that high class hollywood shit   We don't start drama, but if it's around,   Say hello to a motown throw-down in detroit   That's how we do it in detroit,   That's how we do it in detroit,   Up in the d, d, d   Yeah that's how we do it in the d baby   Blue and gray all the way, and we came to play   So what's up now dawg?.Must I travel... far and wide?.You know, it's more than just an aggravation..You did the best that you could do..Here comes the night   It's gonna be a long and lonely night   Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright      As I walk down this dusty road   My heart weights down like a heavy load   My spirit finds its way across the ocean      And my soul cries out for leaving now   I have got to get back home somehow   She stole my heart, oh how my spirit cried   Cause I had to leave and it broke me up inside      Here comes the night   It's gonna be a long and lonely night   I see tomorrow in a different light   This long and lonely night      I've got a weary head and worn out shoes   A bottle of rum and as I sing the blues   The bitter wind sends shivers down my spine      I'm a ramblin' man with a ramblin' mind   I left my loved ones far behind   She stole my heart, oh how my spirit cried   Cause I had to leave and it broke me up inside      Here comes the night   It's gonna be a long and lonely night   Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright   This long and lonely night      Oh bless my soul, what have I done   I'm bound to face this world alone   A drifter I was meant to be   With no one there for company   But if one day down there road I can,   Would you look my way   Would you take me back again      Here comes the night   It's gonna be a long and lonely night   Oh Lord, I pray it's gonna be alright   This long and lonely night      As my souls cries out for leaving.Mary, did you know   That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?.I'm free to bore my well-bought friends,   And spend my cash until the end,   'cause I'm bored!.She walks by me as though she didn't   Know I was alive      And I want her so ba-aa-aad   Mother Nature has a hold on me   I want her so bad   Mother Nature won't you let me be untied?.It's the final condom   We enjoy it togetherrr..No matter what you make   All that you can take   Is what you give away      You know it's not too late   It's all for Heaven's sake   What you give away   What you give away   What you give away.Where are the new rebels   We didn't ask for this   Trying to be something different   We will fight the bigots   Fight them with our reason   Fight them with our constancy      [Chorus]   River, our river, let it flow   This is our lamp light   Let it glow   River, river, let it flow   This is our reason   Let it grow   Don't keep looking back   Living in the past   Never built a golden future..Sleep and dream of this   Death angel's kiss   Brings final bliss   Don't believe it!.Listen to the wind   Hear the voice inside you..rather thoughtful..Now the milkman's on his way,      It's too late to say goodnight..This is like, speaking in tongues   Whoo!.Just take me as I am, so please, have faith!.[The Serpent to Mankind:]   ""Sons of pain, agonize, bring forth then die   Your sorrows will multiply and you shall share my fall...""

"Dear Local Newspaper, Experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while. Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. They also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning. Most people try not to be overweight. Experts should Not try to have less people on the computer. One reason is that people can chat with one another. It can be friends, families, and more. About @PERCENT1 of people chat online with families or friends. Chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. It can make someone a better person. You can't agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand-eye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet. Using the computer this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the for a while is not a waste of time. People can you their time wisly on the computer. Surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer. So you should try to make people be on the computer less often..It was   Sealed with a kiss!.Just another day   And I think I'll die before it ends   It's just another day   And I sure like to go see my baby again      Time was when I did not know   What they meant when they said a man was blue   But now I know because of you   What I know because of you      Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again   Right now, right now   Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again   Somehow, somehow   Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' now      Just another day   There ain't nothin' going down   Nothin' going down I already know   'Cause I already called around      I am worse, when I did not know   Just what they meant when they said a day went wrong   But now I know it's been too long   Since I knew it had been too long      Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again   Right now, right now   Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' I could be with you again   Somehow, somehow   Sweet darlin' I am just wishin' now.Baby, don't you cry   Baby, I'll sing you a lullaby      We're walking down the   Street of chance   Where the chance is always   Slim or none   And the intentions unjust      Baby there's nothing to see   I've already been   Down the street of chance      Baby you're so clean   Baby please stay clean   Baby you're so young   Baby please stay young   Baby, don't you cry   Baby, we've already cried   We want some we want some   All aboard for fun time   Fun   Baby baby we like your lips   Fun   Baby baby we like your pants   All aboard for fun time.Call it a day ?.Love is a fire   Burns down all that it sees   Burns down everything   Everything you think burnt down   Everything you say      She blew me her death-kiss and the mouth-marks bled down my eyes   Like her dying on my windshield, I can already feel her worms eating my spine   So how can it be this lonely?.I was born on the cemetery   Under the sign of the moon   Raised from my grave by the dead   I was made a mercenary   In the legions of Hell   Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane      You know my only pleasure   Is to hear you cry   I'd love to hear you cry   I'd love to feel you die   And I'll be the first   To watch your funeral   And I'll be the last to leave   I'd love to hear you cry      And when you're down beyond the ground   I'll dig up your body again   And make love to shame   Oh lady, cry, and say goodbye   Oh lady, cry, and say goodbye      You've gotta say goodbye   'Cause I will eat your mind.Professional crastination   It's a way of life, if you've got lots of time   Professional crastination   We're living in a procrastination   Professional cra, crastination.I don't regret and won't forget   A single thing that we went through   But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you..Would you like a little company?.Cause everyone knows that Monica glows at night..Go!.[Chorus]      We don't need no explanation   Cause this love will make our confirmation,   So let it do, let it do,   Girl, let us lose ourselves in this magic   Now babe tonight!.I wouldn't be me if she wasn't her,   And it's far too late, anyway..Sit by the river's edge, and watch the water flow,   Sunlight that touched your face, and told you not to go..Dear Granny, there's mummers, there's twenty or more..Don't my gal look fine   When she's comin' after me?.From Marilyn to Madonna   I always loved your smile   Now we're headed for the big divorce   California-style..Yeah !.My hometown's commin' in sight, if you think I'm happy your right..Before I played it   You knew my hand..C moon, C moon, C moon is she."
"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been running late to a party and just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Have you ever had to write a paper and there wen't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? @CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable @CAPS2 and the can be fun too. To begin with let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? @CAPS1 you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably wan't answer because they're @CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable.

key hit the lock   And the clock looked at me just like the devil in disguise   I saw it in her eyes   She'd be gone before the evening      So I poured another strong one   And chopped a line from here to Texas   'Cause I've lost another good one   She's on the midnight train to Memphis      With a brand new start   I swore I'd love from the heart   I meant to change my ways   But I've seen better days      Than the one that's here this morning, mmhm   With a wife and kids at home   With a job somewhere on some assembly line   I wish I had that life   I bet you wish you had mine      So I poured another tall one   And chopped a line from here to Texas   'Cause I've lost another good one   She's on the midnight train to Memphis      Dude, what station is this, K snooze   Kid Rock, I thought he was the American bad ass   He's putting me to sleep   Nudge me if he gets over five decibels   I knew his first album was the good one      But that's the way I am, and this is how I jam   All across the land from Alabam' to bandstand   Doped up rebel with an attitude, shit   So fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch      I won't switch, won't quit no vices   Flip the script cause I'm

So fuck it, if you don't dig that you can suck it   Yeah, and it don't, and it don't      With an old suitcase, I swear I'll leave this place   I'll get you back in time, can't drink you off my mind   So I'll see you when I'm sober   I been looking for some reasons   But I ain't found one down in Texas   I been changing with the seasons   Walked in a new line back to Memphis.I came to you and never asked too much   Wondering what you would say   Hoping you'd understand   It's not a role I usually play   Don't speak too much of what's been going on   The past is over and gone   Give me your troubled mind   You know it's due   I can do so much for you      I want you   Having you near me, holding you near me   I want you to stay and never go away   It's so right   Having you near me, holding you near me   I'll love you tonight, it feels so right   Feels so right      You're brave to say that you get lost in love   But you opened your heart to me   Underneath all you feel you know   How deep our love could be   Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go   Then I'm leaving it up to you   Even a fool would know that I'm not through   I can do so much for you      I want you   Having you near me, holding you near me   I want you to stay and never go away   It's so right   Having you near me, holding you near me   I'll love you tonight, it feels so right   Feels so right.Oh I wonder what would be had we not created me   Just a shadow, a shadow of a man      I'm just a shadow, a shadow of a man   The eyes of statues standing along the nave   They seem to follow my every move   They drive me insane      Surrounded by darkness in this cold church of thine   I try to remember, all that once was mine   I don't know what tomorrow will bring   But if life is so divine, how

"I saw in one of the news papers I got in the mail that had an overnight for people to state their opinion on kids computer useage. I took the idea of waiting this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things. Such as: homework assignments such as essays, sometimes peoples family members go off to was but can't use cell phones, also online job alpications. To start off with, kids have homework assignment right? Most of the time people have to do essays. I ask my mom lots of times if I can do an essay for school, she say, ""why don't you stay after to do it?"" @CAPS1 have lives so they can't stay after, also at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reasons kids use computers alot. Next,, some family members go off to war. Normally for safly and privacy, they wont let the soldiers life their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they to know their ok so they don't have to for two years. So, the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job aplications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commertials show avertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types for people, homebound, elderly, ect. But mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclution, Some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they wont see for along period of time, also school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers when ever they want..Where there is a flame, someone's

"Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos, even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it let's you know things as well. The computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool. The programs teach you how to type, it is called type to learn or type for fun. Also they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it let's you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You have friends with and know who they are and won't need to figure it out. So, this is why I believe that having a computer is a good idea, and good to have. You can talk to people long distance. The computer teaches you things for life. Finally it makes you more social with people. So in @CAPS1 strong opinion it is a good idea to have a computer..It's only been an hour   Since he locked her in the tower   The time has come   He must be undone   By the morning      Many times before   The tyrant's opened up the door   Then someone cries   Still we close our eyes   Not again      Meet me when the sun is in the western skies   The fighting must begin before another someone dies   Cross bows in the fire light   Green sleeves waving   Madmen raving   Through the shattered night   Yeah yeah yeah      Flames are getting higher   Make it leap unto the spire   Draw bridge down   Cut it to the ground   We shall dance around the fire      No more night   We have seen the light   Let it shine on bright   Hang him higher, higher      Draw bridge down   Cut it to the ground   We shall dance all around the fire, around the fire      No more night   we've seen the light   let it shine on bright      Hang him higher, higher   Put the man on the fire      Draw bridge down   Cut it to the ground   We gotta dance around the fire, the fire, the fire.I just came here to party   But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty   Your hands around my waist just let the music play   We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face      [Chorus]      Please don't stop the music      Please don't stop the music, music, music      Please don't stop the music, music, music      [Chorus]      Please don't stop the music      Please don't stop the music, music, music      Please don't stop the music, music, music, music, music, music, music.The spirit is willing   But the flesh is weak   Why do I have to wear so many things on my head?.Why are we worried?.Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne   Don't keep your love inside   Luanne, luanne   Don't need to run and hide   Luanne, luanne   Don't keep your love inside   Luanne, luanne, luanne, luanne   I wanna be beside you, can't you understand?.I want to change..Oh, when October rolls around, will you sober up and let me down?.Ciribiribin, he waits for her each night beneath her balcony..Never gonna heal   See what's in my blood   What'ca ya gonna feel?.'Cause I've come so far   And I need you now   Yes, it's true....I cut your wood so easy for you,   You can't help but say, ""Hot Dog!"".You're in the mood for love   You're in the mood to dance   You're in the mood for a little romance   You're in the mood for love   I see you've pressed those pants   I see you've styled that hair   There doesn't seems to be much of it there   You're in the mood to dance   Can I have this chance   To be your little romance?.I'm there..A fist full of fury, no judge and no jury,   There is a time and there's a place..That understands the way that I feel inside,   Cause      [Chorus]      (you stole my heart away)   You stole it..These hoes can just jump up off me man   I don't give a fuck what the DMA say, you hear what I'm sayin?.The sounds just drift across my room,   I wish this feeling I could share..""Please God, don't help him hit it to me..Well, don't you ever be sad   Lean on me when times are bad   When the day comes and you're in doubt   In a river of trouble, about to drown      Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming      I'm on my way, your lover   When you get cold, yeah, I'll be your cover   Don't have to worry because I'm here   Don't need to suffer because I'm here      Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming      Reach out to me for satisfaction   Call my name, quick reaction      Well, don't you ever feel sad   Lean on me when times are bad   When the day comes and you're in doubt   In a river of trouble and about to drown      Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming      Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming   Hold on, hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming.All this time the river flowed endlessly like a silent tear..I couldn't stand to pretend,   You're makin' a lie of our love."
"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a @ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost @NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. Yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to @CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my @CAPS2 always said,"" @CAPS3 more, it builds character!"" @CAPS4 ever I get the chance I @CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids theses days can be mean with out try. You disconnect yourself from your family.

Confidence in all that I believe   You are only holy   You are love defined   And you have said to ask and I'll receive   So I have come to pray   That you will come and fill   The hunger here inside

your side again   Don't make me believe you   Before you let me have   A chance to try again   Or I'll be gone before   You ever know you're losing me      I know I've made mistakes   That bought you sorrow   But baby, keep in mind   You're not right all the time   Don't let me go away   To face a new tomorrow   Back where you bought me from   When I was glad to come      [Chorus:]   Come to your window   Look down and see the teardrops   In my desperate eyes   Look how I need you   I got to find a way to make you realize   That you are casting out   The deepest love you'll ever know      Please don't close your ears   To what I'm saying   Before I ride away into the early day   I spent the lonesome evening hours praying   That you will change your mind   And try me one more time      Come to your window   Before our love comes crashing   Into pieces on the ground   Don't let it happen   I promise you this time   I'll never let you down   Give me a cause to come   To your lonesome arms again      [Chorus:].Love is a burning inside   I never had this feeling before, no   All I know is that it won't let me be myself   Hey, is this really love   Oh maybe that's the reason   I feel so good when you're around   (Feel so good when you're around)   Why can't I remember   The day I melted before your charms   Oh was it way back in September   When you held me in your arms   Now that I see that you're the one for me   It's no more a mystery   Love has fallen down on me   Ooh I'm in love with you   Love has fallen on me   Now I really see   Love has fallen on me   Oh what tender love you bring   No, it's not a game   Oh what tender love you bring   No, it's not a game   Hey what tender love you bring   I fell in love with you   Fell in love with you   One day in September love came falling down on me   One day in September love came tumbling down on me   Ooh what tender love you bring   Oh now Lord I can't, no no,   And I can't believe my eyes   No no one day in September,   It came on down   Oh fallin' down, love came falling all around   I fell in love with you   Fell in love with you.Oh..Then we gon' go three and three, you gon' undress me..Oh God, Pride of Man, broken in the dust again."

"Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to..Are you the teachers of my heart?.American dream, American dream,   American dream, American dream..You're gonna find someday you gotta run away..Give me my rapture today..I don't know if it's cloudy or bright cause I only   Have eyes for you..Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,   And the silhouette was seen for miles around..What is so rare as a day in June?.I used to gad about   With any chap   And now I'm sad about my sap..Let's   Get together again..Can't you hear this beauty in life?.(hide hands behind back)      Little Arabella Miller   Had a fuzzy caterpillar   First it crawled upon her brother   Then upon her dear grandmother   Gran said, ""Arabella Miller,   How I love your caterpillar. "".Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop   Yeah, and you don't stop, cause it's 1-8-7 on an undercover cop   Six fo' five was the time on the clock,   When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot..And finally see, the face of Jesus..All of my life,   I've been searchin' for a girl   To love me like I love you..(Ha ha ha ha)   I told you I was Shady!.Let me put it this way doll   And I know it's getting late   I can tell from the planes of your face   That you're from out of state   But here in the willows now here's the deal   Tomorrow's for squares, tonight's for real      Drop me off in Groovetime   Do you hear the slang of ages   Show me how it's done      Now did you say you were from the Netherlands   Or was that ""Netherworld""?.Somewhere a baby's feeding   Somewhere a mother's needing   Outside her boy is trying   But mostly he is crying   Did you see his eyes?.Let's got back to Eden,   Don't make the garden wait..[Chorus]   'Cause I can turn back the hands of time,   Make you mine   Sweet and fine..Will that make you realize?.Three more days and I'm home."

"Computers can affect the way people are and how they interact. Why is there a need to spend your precious life sitting in front of a compute all day?When you can be getting exercise for example going to your local gym. Computers become a distraction to your social life, thats why you should use them for emergency's and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends. Lastly you can enjoy you surrounding and appreciate life and nature. Computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things. Exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit. If your sitting in front of a computer all day your body is going to shut down and won't get the proper exercise. Sports can be just as enjoyable and helps build the human body and gives you the right amount of exercise that your body needs. Sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more. Family is a wonderful thing in life, but they don't live forever. That's why we should cherries every last moment we have with them. A complete citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends. To sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals, for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergency's and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction. Instead of using them we could be getting the right amount of exercise, and spending it with family, and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them. .To welcome home our darling boy,   Hurrah!.Don't hold back, don't let down   It's all or nothing now   Something's changing deep inside me   I'm letting go of all I'm hiding   I'm in over my head   But I'm not afraid   To dive in deep and make some waves   No type of inquisition   Could ever make me change my position   I've told you before   Tell me to be quiet and I'll shout some more.I come back from the other side   I come for the people that took away my life   Trick or treat bitch, my dead body speaks   You tricked me now it's only right   that you try my rotten treats   Trick or treat, trick or treat   Watch as the dead man walks the street (2x)   Mr. Rotten Treats got all the good shit   over hereboys and girls, I got balls freshly   picked form Detroits biggest nutsacks, I got   Milky bar with the delicious razor blade filling   I got fudge freshly packed from the worlds rarest fudge packer   Must return to the other side   But not before I take these bitches on a murder ride   Murder go round the dead body clown   Put the treats in your mouth, and swish it around   Excuse me little boy, but is your daddy home?.Really had a good time      Hot patootie, bless my soul   Really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll      (Saxophone solo)      Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll   Hot patootie, bless my soul   I really love that Rock and Roll.I want it all   I want it all   I don't know what it is   But I want it all      I want it all   I want it all   I don't know what it is   But I want it all      And I want it now   I want it now   I don't know what it is   But I want it now      Yea yea yea   Yea yea yea      Gimme gimme some more   Of the same old stuff   It don't make me happy   And it's never enough      Gimme gimme some more   Of the same old stuff   It don't make me happy   And it's never enough      Peel back my skin   So that you can see   What I really am   The true color of me      Peel back my skin   So that you can see   What I really am   The true color of me      Yea yea yea   Yea yea yea      Yea yea yea   Yea yea yea.Hey hey hey hey)   (Hey hey hey..I mean jesus your rhymes aint even witty   And every one here knows your lyrics are shitty   But its ok cuz your tryin your best   And if you have a girlfriend I'm sure her backs like her chest   In other words you be fucking a guy   And don't tell me the excuse, its cuz I was high   Its cuz your like at the other fags who think their cool   But infact your really enjoy pushing it stool!.Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,   It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!.(Ah) Can't crow before I'm out of the woods   There's exceptions to the rule   (Ah-ah) Senorita, do you need a friend?.[Chorus].All of my shirts are unsightly, all of my ties are a crime   If dear in you I've picked rightly, it's the very first time      You came along, say, I think you're wonderful   I think you're grand but I may be wrong      I may be wrong but I think you're swell   But I can't see, so how can I tell?.They like ""how did he get all them rocks in?

"Computers are the way of the future. I believe that computers benefit society. I believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online. It also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from. Lastly it teached hand-eye coordination. First computers alow you to socialize online. I know @CAPS1 I get home from school I can talk to virtually any friends online. People against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family, however, this is not true. I talk to all of my aunts via facebook and other social websites. Also @CAPS1 my parents are at work the are abile to message me over the computer with out having to go get a phone and call my house. My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get intouch easier lets say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He woulden't have to go look up a number and call me, he could just send me a message of the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education. I know that @CAPS1 I'm stuck on a problem at home, I'll just go on the computer and look up the answer. Also, @CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids, @CAPS1 doing a project, I can't getall of my information from one book so I go on the computer and look up information about the subject. This really improves students grades, because they had more resources and more information to choose from, instead of only the information in the book. My last reason is that using a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. On the computer there are many sites that have very interactive sites the you can really benefit from I know of one website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had interactive games that would actually help with things is real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball. So the computer actually helped with real life activities. To sum it all up I think computers can benefit society a lot. Like being able to communicate with your friends. Also being able to look up school work with. Lastly helping with hand-eye coordination..Thenardier   So it goes, heaven knows   Life has dealt me some terrible blows..And the cradle will rock..You can read my hand I've got no defence   When you send your messages, whispered loud and clear   I'm always touched by your presence dear   Floating pass the evidence of possibilities   We could navigate together psychic frequencies   Coming into contact with outer entities   We could entertain each one with our theosophies   Stay awake at night and count your REM's   When you're talking with your super friends   Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere   I am still in touch with your presence dear   I am still in touch with your presence dear.Bombs, dropping down,   Please forgive, our hometown,   In our insignificance..Hey woman walking on a wire   I know your back is to the wall   What lies in water lies in fire   It's all in how you take the fall   Why don't you stay with me   Oh, lay with me   Don't turn the lights on me   Tonight on me   (stay with me)   The streets are cold in new york city   Why don't we break the ice   Now just like a fool I'll be feeling guilty   So just this once I won't think twice   Why don't you stay with me   Oh, lay with me   The only crime I see   Is killing time with me   (stay with me)   And oh, what a feeling   When I'm with you   You play with fire   What am I supposed to do   Hey woman life's too short to straddle   You're either right or wrong   So come on gamble   Just don't keep me hanging on   Why don't you stay with me   Oh lay with me   The only crime I see   Is killing time with me.You can type that I'm quite nice if they buy it..We gonna jump ship, all aboard   Come around me, and we'll parlay, we're throwed?.The world keeps on moving but I'm holding still..Now this might surprise you, but   I find I'm OK by myself   And I don't need you   Or your morality to save me   No, no, no, no, no      Then came an arm around my shoulder   Well surely the hand holds a revolver   It's been so all of my life   Why change now?.Don't want to fall apart before we have a chance   To try again   Don't let it end      I tried so hard to make it right for you and I   Your sacred promises have all become a lie      Is this your idea of destiny?.Time goes by and people change   It's best we go our separate ways   And it was wrong to think our love would never end   My friend   Nothing lasts forever,   Nothing lasts forever..You know you can't live high if you can't live low   If you can't live low   Are you low?.Or did you say   ""The frontiers are falling   It's time to be slipping away   Let's slip away, let's slip away""   All things fall from me   The bonds and the veils   All things blow by me   My sorrows have sails   Was I dreaming?.I got my Cat Scratch Fever eight-track   My best friend's in a gun rack   I'm a lowlife   I owe everybody money   I think racist jokes are funny   I'm a lowlife   I got a dirty mind, a gutter mouth   I'm makin' time, I'm goin' out   With your wife      'Cause I'm a lowlife   I'm a lowlife      I got kids I never seen   And their momma's seventeen   I'm a lowlife   I take strippers out to breakfast   You can add that to my checklist   I'm a lowlife   Ahh the landlord called the rent is due   I spent it all on a Kiss tattoo   I Rock n Roll all night      'Cause I'm a lowlife   I'm a lowlife   I'm a lowlife   Livin' the highlife      I'm watchin' porno on the TV   Wonderin' why she'd ever leave me   I'm a lowlife   The object of my affection   Asked the police for protection   I'm a lowlife   The romance is gone, I'm doin' fine   Me and your mom had a real good time   Just last night      'Cause I'm a lowlife   I'm a lowlife      I make black music for the white man   Keep cocaine upon my nightstand   I'm a lowlife   Ain't never hung out in the Catskills   But I've been to jail in Nashville   I'm a lowlife   I've got a dirty mind, a gutter mouth   I'm makin' time, I'm goin' out   With your wife      I'm a lowlife   I'm a lowlife   I'm a lowlife   Livin' the highlife.High risk insurance   The time is right   High risk insurance   The time is right      Got endurance, I was trained   I got my sights adjusted and my telescope aimed      Everybody wants an explanation   Got no love for the enemy nation      High risk insurance   High risk insurance   High risk insurance   High risk insurance      You gotta fight to stay independent   I got my pride and I'm gonna defend it.When you're in a dream,   And you think you've got your problems all nailed down..Its a game they play   Whos gonna save your soul?.Naturally, I thought I wouldn't..Carolina we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up,   Maybe I should go to California   So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through   I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do..When Death Calls -

"Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I strongly believe that computers effect us in a positive way. Computers are advancing and so are their uses, computers are great and they are not our thought process or went to run around outside and play sports. Computers help us find and talk to relatives and friends they allow us to learn different things about farien places. They also are great for research! First and foremost computers are effecting us positively expesally when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted and @NUM1 years ago she really wanted to find her birth family, one year later her birth father found her on this website where you can locate family, she found her family and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have of been able to get to know them if it wasnt for the computer, speaking of communication, I was working like a dog on this big science prodject I had. we weren't able to do it in person and it @CAPS3 impossible for one person to three way four people. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done. ""@CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!"" @CAPS3 something that @CAPS3 commonly said. Over @PERCENT1 of adults complain that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 never enough time in day. That @CAPS3 a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi task so you can be on your business call and email your mother so she know that you didn't forget her birthday. In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing. @CAPS2 are many people who don't have tvs and they get their news from the internet. Also for projects, in @NUM2 grade I had to learn about @CAPS4, the country in @LOCATION2. it would take countless hours to find research in books, you will find a lot of stuff you dont need, but on the computer it @CAPS3 fast and easy. If you need to know something you can just type it in and, boom! You have it where as if you were usinf a book you would still be looking for what you need. Time @CAPS3 something that we can't afford to waste expessaly in this economy. Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer, and exersizing are not always right. I don't know about you, @PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exersizes to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions, finding routs on maps are enfuriating and take for ever. Go on the computer the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt. In conclusion computers effect us in possitive ways, more and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye in this matter, advancing computers are our friends not the enemy..Association with the past   So think about it   It's like a tie that did not last   Don't move so fast   Don't run, cause you might find out,   Find out I'm the one   And I still feel lonesome      Well I'm still lonesome   Yeah   I'm still lonesome..This...boy...is in motion   Some density   Moved right beside me   I want   My sentence   Right here   But now I'm far away      A sign was given but   Many years have passed   Cost a little bit to love you but I   Won't can't stop   Such a happy day   For me   Bring a happy day   To me   Send a happy day   To me   And a happy day   Came to me come to me here it come....Stars fading, but I linger on, dear,   Still craving your kiss..But it all fades so quickly like a sunny summer day,   Reporters ask you questions and they write down what you say..[Hook:]   Stand by me,   Stand by me,   Stand by me,   Stand by me,   Stand by me and be my love tonight, oh,   Stand by me,   Stand by me,   Stand by me,   Stand by me,   Stand by me and be my love tonight, oh!.They came flying from far away, now I'm under their spell   I love hearing the stories that they tell   They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons   They speak strangely but I understand      And I dream I'm an eagle   And I dream I can spread my wings   Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky   I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze   High, high, what a feeling to fly   Over mountains and forests and seas   And to go anywhere that I please      As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing   I have questions and they know everything   There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher   Am I dreaming or is it all real?.Bing scats..Where my ladies at?.Won't you get hip to this timely tip:   When you make that California trip   Get your kicks on Route sixty-six..The road he treads is difficult and stony   He rides fer days on end with just a pony for a friend      I sure am feeling sorry for the pony!.Moon of gold in the sky..Passion queen sold like black vaseline   She was a long cold Sally, joy stick, know what I seen   She's alright      Drashin' spurs, pong man, puss n' boots   She was an old mo lip, bold hip, oooh   Fucked up fucked up fuck 'em fuck 'em booty yeah      Sweet pretty lady (Lick 'em, love 'em)   Loose city floozy (Push 'em, shove 'em)   All kinda crazys (Left for lover)   Hair line choosy      New York Jets, old Jock, wide in the city   Locker room lady, drive me crazy, what you do   She's all tight   Ain't alright, heh heh      Sweet pretty lady (Lick 'em, love 'em)   Loose city floozy (Push 'em, shove 'em)   All kinda crazy (Left for lover)   Hair line choosy   One for the funny   Two for the love   All to get ready      Sweet pretty lady (Lick 'em, love 'em)   Loose city floozy (Push 'em, shove 'em)   All kinda crazy (Left for lover)   Hair line choosy.Well, gonna rock, gonna rock,   Gonna rock, yeh gonna rock..And when my fires have all burned out,   I'd like to think I can still think about   The things I used to sing about   When I was spending all my time alone..(""Oh, re mikayina!"").Would you still want me around?.Magic!.Oh, please   Say you're not intending to tease   Speed that happy ending and please,   Tell me that you love me too..Down my country road, oh..Use just once and destroy   Invasion of our piracy   Afterbirth of a nation   Starve without your skeleton key      I love you for what I am not   I do not want what I have got   A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns   Speak at once while taking turns   Second-rate third defree burns   What is wrong with me   What is what I need   What do I think I think   This had nothing to do with what you think   If you ever think at all   Bi-polar opposites attract   All of a sudden my water broke   Hate, hate your enemies   Save, save your friends   Find, find your place   Speak, speak the truth.Waiting, I got no town to hide in   The country's got a hold of my soul   TV's dead and there ain't no war in my head   And you seem very beautiful to me      Sleeping but my works not done   I could be lying on an atom bomb   I'll take care   Cause I know you'll be there   You seem very beautiful to me      It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling and rolling   Picture in my pocket looks like you   It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling, rolling, rolling along"
"Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. Humans especially children, need exercise. But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. @NUM1 year olds are making facebooks! You can find @NUM2 year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their ""friends"" lie to them, about their age, another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2,@CAPS3, farmpring, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to at back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together.

"Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place. People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly. What society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition,you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease! Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it! The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well! Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want! Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing..A diamond dazzling   Oh, Attawapiskat   You're on your way      You're on your way   You're on your way   You're on the way      Oh, Attawapiskat   Oh, goodnight, Attawapiskat   Thank you!.When you tell me that you're leaving   And that you've got to be alone   Sometimes you seem to me like you're far away   In some different danger zone   I couldn't stop you if I wanted   You found somebody else for sure   What you don't know is I've found some love   Like some revolving door   Yeah   Temptation's gonna come into our lives   Gonna break up our happy home   Temptation   Me and you are going through it   And we should know better   To leave that thing alone   You always seem to be distracted   Just like your mind is somewhere else   If you don't want to be alone with some strange guy   You're gonna wind up on the shelf   Yeah   Temptation's gonna come into our lives   Gonna break up our happy home   Temptation   Me and you are going through it   And we should know better   Yeah yeah   To leave that thing alone   Temptation's gonna go into our lives   Gonna break up our happy home   Temptation   Me and you are going through it   And we should know better   Yeah yeah   Temptation's gonna go into our lives   Gonna break up our happy home   Temptation   Me and you are going through it   And we should know better   Yeah yeah   Oh.I have looked through every single book,   Torn through every poem,   Heard the words of every voice   That I've known..Put off the mail and I   Left on a light and I   Locked up the house and I   Jumped on a flight and I'm   Still by myself but I'm   Thinking more clear if I'm   Gonna be down, gonna be down way down here      [Chorus]   Where no one will ask cause nobody knows   That you're not in my life anymore   And no one can tell the salt water from my tears   No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves   Ain't gonna wash your memory away   But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier   If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here      Untied my lines and I   Slid through the sound and I   Mixed me a drink now I   Sit on the bow and I'm   Watching the sun just like you'll disappear   If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here      [Chorus]      No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves   Ain't gonna wash your memory away   But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier   And if I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down   If I'm gonna be down, I'd rather be down way down here   Way down here      If you want me back now   I can be found   Way down here   If I'm gonna be down   If I'm gonna be down   Way down here.Super soul   Super soul fighter's coming   Yes he's coming      Super soul   Super soul   Super soul fighter's coming   Yes he's coming   Hey hey      Yeah !.Or just a new way to bleed?.Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside..Street      Up where they walk   Up where they run   Up where they stay all day in the sun   Wandering free   Wish I could be   Part of that world      What would I give   If I could live   Out of these waters?.I just don't enjoy it as much now..In the land of the pigs the butcher is king!.I just didn't know..Pepper's lonely   Sgt..And the snake says, ""Sssssssssss""      I love General Patton in World War Two   My Pocket Fisherman and my Crazy Glue   I love the Beav and Wally too, yeah   I love America      I love the bomb, hot dogs and mustard   I love my girl, but I sure don't trust her   I love what the Indians did to Custer   I love America      Here they come!.Betta   check it out   before you become one..Yeah!.[ENDYAMON:]   A WHISPER OF DEATH,   A SHADOW OF FEAR   Seven Riches of the Skies   A WHISPER OF DEATH   I bring to you Seven meanings of our Love   There'll be no warning, the Skies are alive   A WHISPER OF DEATH   [THE GODHEAD:]   Thunder War,   Blood and gore Send them   Fear on the tide I will know, I will win Kill them quick,   'fore they rise Bride in the mirror I know who you are   Writing the Book of Demise   Holy Tomorrow I see where you are I will be there when you die !.If there was a better way to go, then it would find me..Ain't yo bidness   Don't get slapped!.Then they flap their wings at the last second..I hope you both choke on a pickle   Man, that would tickle me to death   I don't know what you're waiting on   You're holding up the line   Oh man, you ain't got no change coming back   Are you out of your mind?.But it seems like...

"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1 you really think computers are that good? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great..My mind plays tricks on me,   It's unbelievable you see,   I'm always testing the shit around me..Loving you is like a puzzle   Just when I think that this is it   You shake me up   The pieces just don't fit   It's like a ...   Jigsaw - Puzzle      I lay my heart out on the table   I let you know my every move   But darlin' you are so unstable   Your needle never lifts the groove      Now order may not be your nature   But I think that we could work out fine   If you would only trace the dotted line      Jigsaw - Puzzle   Jigsaw - Puzzle.Oh      Drive faster, boy yo uh, oh no      The crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl   With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls   I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier   Of stars and atmosphere, and watched her   And watched her disappear   Into the midnight show      Faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, faster   Oh, no no no no no no, no no no no no   If you keep a secret   Well baby I can keep, if you can keep a secret   (She said she loved me)   If you can keep a secret, I can keep a secret   (She said she loved me)   If you can keep a secret well baby I can keep it a secret.Bring me water, water, water   Bring me water, water, water   Bring me water, water, water   Bring me water.You know that you didn't have to do it   It was clean fore you did it, you didn't have to do it   It was a 2013 car, man you didn't have to do it   It's Gucci Mane

and he didn't have to do it.I've tried to make you smile..As much as I love you   As much as I care   I just can't pretend that   The problem's not there   We know all the boundaries   From where we both stand   Our life has been happy   Without any plan   But now I feel sorrow   As friendship turns stale   Our love's still on track but   Without a third rail   The moon has come up now   The sun has gone down   A million or more times   Since you've been around   Our life still goes on but   It won't be the same   As when we're together   Love only knows pain   With words that are tender   Our love will prevail   But can our love go on   Without a third rail      White clouds appear like cotton wool   The wind bends trees to bow   As we farewell this love of ours   Like some old sacred cow   As sure as heaven's above us   And hell is down below   Without a third rail to drive us   We'll have no place to go      There's a lump in my throat   I'm choked as I say   Our love has reached twilight   Let's call it a day   We kiss on the platform   The doors slowly close   Like theatre curtains   Pulled after the show   We both know it's over   And somehow we've failed   Love's going in circles   Without a third rail.let's do it again an' again!.So save me, I, I, I      I'm not fuckin around   Stop fucking with me      And the children are born..I've never kissed a bear   I've never kissed a coon   But I shake a chicken in the middle of the room   Let's have a party..The tears I shed were tears of joy   I know the meaning of contentment   Now I am happy with the Lord      Just a plain and simple chapel   Where humble people go to pray   I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger   As I live from day to day      I've searched and I've searched   But I couldn't find   No way on earth   To gain peace of mind      Now I'm happy in the chapel   Where people are of one accord   We gather in the chapel   Just to sing and praise the Lord      Ev'ry sinner looks for something   That will put his heart at ease   There is only one true answer   He must get down on his knees      Meet your neighbor in the chapel   Join with him in tears of joy   You'll know the meaning of contentment   Then you'll be happy with the Lord      You'll search and you'll search   But you'll never find   No way on earth   To gain peace of mind      Take your troubles to the chapel   Get down on your knees and pray   Your burdens will be lighter   And you'll surely find the way.Can't guarantee I won't touch you, girl, 'cause I just might..On a countdown to zero   Take a ride on the

inside a roller coaster car   I feel safe in the hills   Up above it all sometimes   In the middle of the night, I can almost see the stars      Living in L.A. makes me think of you   I think about the good times doing all the bad things we used to do   Walked the streets and I could remember why I feel so bad   Walked the streets at night, it helps sometimes to remember why      Living in L.A. feels like home in a brand new way   I am like everyone I meet,   I have ghosts in my mind they will never go away   I walked the streets at night to understand why I feel so bad   I walked the streets at night questioning why I am the way I am      We come from the somewhere lost time out in the cold   We run for the light, it's the only way we know   Wanna find a better sun, I wanna find a better world   Wanna find a better heart, so I can find me a better girl   Wanna find a place living inside of the violence and the rage   Of the Santa Ana wind on sunny day..Is it lovey dovey stuff,   Do you need a bit of rough?"
"There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also it always gives you information everytime you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not everytime when you need information the computer won't give it to you. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have alot more fun adavantages. One of the most common and used thing around the world is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 is when you are communicating with another human bean over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend. There are some names for instant @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4-mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people I agree that they stay on the computer to much and became very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you from exercizing and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more, but to long is not good. There are so many things for the computer I can't name them all @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers, those are many of the things you can do on your computer.

"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a big role in our world today. For example people use computers to get imformation, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and fined friends. I think this @CAPS6 messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers @CAPS6 messing people up @CAPS6 because of the impformation that @CAPS6 on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This @CAPS6 ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people @CAPS6 the dangerous chat rooms. This @CAPS6 not good because your not familliar with the person your talking too. The person could have posed as another person and be very hipocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasent. Like you might give them you number, adress, @CAPS2 personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, @CAPS2 ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that @CAPS6 given to thousands of people online. Another words the""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" @CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" @CAPS9 these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on..And I have a funny, funny feeling   And the hair's rising on my head..I saw the sign and it opened up my mind   And I am happy now living without you   I've left you   Oh, oh-oh-oh   I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign   No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong      (I saw the sign, I saw the si-ee-ign) I saw the sign   (I saw the sign, I saw the si-ee-i-ee-ign)   (I saw the sign, I saw the sign)   I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign.A generation without name, ripped and torn   Nothing to lose, nothing to gain   Nothing at all   And if you can't help yourself   Well take a look around you   When others need your time   You say it's time to go... it's your time..When I go to sleep   I don't count the sheep,   I just think about my sweetie-pie..I mean ya, lookin' good, yeah you still got it   Been reminiscin' and I'm not sure how I feel about it   Now we can say that all good things come to an end   But we know each other way too well to pretend   We went from friends to somethin' much more   To breakin' up to makin' up and fuckin' once more   Second chances, we gave enough to finally   We gave it up, but some days I be wakin' up and wantin' one more   But what for?.I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction..I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car   They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars   Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free   But those people keep a movin'   And that's what tortures me...

"Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spent time on their computer. The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family.Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family. These ar my reason why i think that we shouldn't be on the computers. We should spend more time with friends family or go outside, and enjoy nature..Wish someone would tell me when   I won't think of you again..C three.I opened up my mind   Peace I could not find   Then something out of the blue   Said I needed you      Time swept me away   Merged me into pain   Then something out of the blue   Said you need me too      Oh what joy it bring to me   To know that heavens round   Oh what gladness in my heart   To know my loves been found      Now where hope was lost   Loves paid the cost   And something out of the blue   Said my love is you   Something out of the blue   Said I needed you   Something out of the blue.Where are my kids having their fights?.I'm in love with mean girl   I'm in love      Bum luck will you ever know   I'm not in love with you   A

up all night   Baby thinkin of you keeps me up all night.Someone told me being in the know is the main thing..I'm becoming less defined   As days go by   Fading away   Well you might say   I'm losing focus   Kinda drifting into the abstract   In terms of how I see myself      Sometimes   I think I can see right through myself   Sometimes   I think I can see right through myself   Sometimes   I can see right through myself      Less concerned   About fitting into the world   Your world, that is   'cause it doesn't really matter   Any more   No, it doesn't really matter   Any more   None of this really matters   Any more      Yes I am alone   But then again I always was   As far back as I can tell   I think maybe it's because   Because you were never really real   To begin with      I just

climbed through      Now I'm somewhere   I am not supposed to be   And I can see things I know   I really shouldn't see      And now I know why   Now I know why   Things aren't as pretty   On the inside      There is no you   There is only me   There is no you   There is only me   There is no fucking you   There is only me   There is no fucking you   There is only me      Only only only only

about the things I could lose   'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you      I'm not gonna fight it I'm gonna choose   To hopelessly fall oh yeah   You know I'll hopelessly fall in love with you.I looked and said, ""even now they come"",   The first one cried for mercy,   The people gave him none,   The second one was violent,He was arrogant and loud,   I still can hear his angry voice   screaming at the crowd,   Then someone said ""there's Jesus"",   I could scarce believe my eyes,   A man so badly beaten,   He barely looked alive,   Blood poured from His body,   From the thorns upon His brow,   Running down the cross, Falling to the ground..I've flown the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel   And though my body's back I know it can't be real   'Cause I've been on that house without a guiding wheel   The house of freezing steel   Oh where's it going, picked me up at seven   When my eyes were weak from the light of the morning   Oh sister won't you tell me what a man might want to know   This madness is fine, yes if you're mad at the time      Back on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel   The tied my body up, I'm forced to eat my meal   A cold plate of lamb and cold potatoes too   Now what's a soul to do   Oh Lord above, brother won't you tell me   Is this a Eucharistic dove   'Cause I've been waiting for the right one to appear   But I've seen it in your face, and baby this ain't the place      Up on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel..INTO THE FIRE!.In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps   While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree..One of the black boys said   ""I need none of your pity""   It's your mama that don't   Like you loose in the city      But stick about, take note   Take a tip, take no back lip   Come come a little closer   Let me see you snap your fingertip      Because standing on the corner   Just might suit you or maybe baby   There's something else you wanna do      Like rolling dice, nice   Like shooting pool, hey that's cool      I'm a little black boy and I don't know my place   I'm just a little black boy, I just threw my ace   I'm a little black boy, recognize my face      One of the black boys said   ""I'm a giving a warning""   ""People been putting me down""   ""I'm so tired I'm yawning""      A new suit, pretty boots to boot   And I'm feeling slick   Gonna go to town, look around   And pull a chick      Of course standing on the corner   Might suit you or maybe baby   There's something else that you wanna do      Like playing poker, joker   Like to back a race, ace      I'm a little black boy and I don't know my proper place   I'm a little black boy, get my head in its space   I'm a little black boy, I just play my bass   I'm a little black boy, it's no disgrace"
"Dear The @CAPS1, I understand that you have some concerns about computers. I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy. In conclusion I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them..Louie, Louie, me gotta go..He led me into his room, and had me lay down   My heart, and my soul, and anything else that you could own,   When you're six years old..To be the prince of possession in the gallery of contempt   Suffering your indiscreet discretions and you ask me to relent   As you accumulate flirtations with the calculated calmness of the whore   I am the harlequin - diamonded costume dripping shades of green   I am the harlequin - sense strangers violate my sanctuary   Prowl my dreams   Plundering your diaries, I'll steal your thoughts innocence   Ravaging your letters, unearth your plots innocence   To don the robes of Torquemada, resurrect the inquisition   In that tortured subtle manner inflict questions within questions   Looking in shades of green through shades of blue   I trust you trust in me to mistrust you   Through the Silk Cut haze to the smeared mascara   A 40 watt sun on a courtroom drama   And the coffee stains gather till the pale kimono   Set the wedding rings dancing on the cold linoleum   And accusations moths that circle on the light   Char their wings and spiral senseless suicidal flight   You packed your world within a suitcase, hot tears melt this icy palace   Dissolve a crystal swallowed by the night   Looking in shades of green through shades of blue   Looking in shades of green through shades of blue.Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,   The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet..Well hey wait a minute what's the matter hold on   You want me to fork over the loot?.Repeat CHORUS.I'm gonna make sure the money is right..I'll trade my horse and saddle, my drivin' I'll

  And there's trouble from the south   Shouting from the gallery   Now I find I've got to shut it out      I'm searching for a light   To kill my sense of fear   To break through darkened nights   And

"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 idea about ""Computers"" is very well thought outside of the box.Well. We sure need computer to look up information these days. Why do we need them now and it dident existed before? Reseach shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything. Let me explain a little bit further to you what I mean. First, you can look up places, chat with friends and family. @CAPS1 oppinion about using the local internet would be that it's good only for those who knows and not trying to be mean. For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm, and never to forget about nature outside of fresh air. In conclusion, internet these days are very good for people..Belle:   There's something sweet   And almost kind   But he was mean   And he was course   And unrefined   And now he's dear   And so I'm sure   I wonder why I didn't see it there before      Beast:   She glanced this way   I thought I saw   And when we touched   She didn't shudder at my paw   No it can't be   I'll just ignore   But then she's never looked at me that way before      Belle:   New and a bit alarming   Who'd have ever thought that this could be   True that he's no prince charming   But there's something in him that I simply didn't see      Lumiere:   Well who'd have thought      Ms. Potts:   Well bless my soul      Cogsworth:   Well who'd have known      Ms. Potts:   Well who indeed      Lumiere:   And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own      Ms. Potts:   It's so peculiar      Ms. Potts, cogsworth, lumiere   We'll wait and see a few days more   There may be something there that wasn't there before      Cogsworth:   Well perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before      Ms. Potts:   There may be something there that wasn't there before.You would be ten and I'd be   Driving you to school   You would tell all your friends   That you thought I was cool   You would be out in the sun   Until it was gone   You would be watching Star Wars   With your PJ's on   You would be playing tunes on   On your first guitar   You would be harmony to   Every single part of me   And you have   All the love in my heart   Yeah, you would have   All the love in my heart      Mm   Mm.Your eyes seek conclusion   In all this confusion of mine   Though you and I both know   It's only the warm glow of wine   That's got you to feeling this way,   But I don't care,   I want you to stay   And hold me and tell me   You'll be here to love me today      Children are dancin',   The gamblers are chancin' their all   The window's accusing   The door of abusing the wall   But who cares   What the night watchmen say   The stage has been set for the play   Hold me and tell me   You'll be here to love me today      The moon's come and gone   But a few stars hang on on to the sky   The wind's runnin' free   But it ain't up to me ask why   The poets are demanding their pay   They've left me with nothin' to say   'cept hold me and tell me   You'll be here to love me today   Just hold me and tell me that   You'll be here to love me today.One love, one heart   Let's get together and feel all right   Hear the children crying (One love)   Hear the children crying (One heart)   Sayin', ""Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will   Feel all right.

"I completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today. Even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them. Since. new technology, and post pictures on websites where everyone can see. Also they have games for computers that people get hooked on. Lastly, there are predator online. The new technology is amazing, like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures, @CAPS1 they do have negative effects. There have been many suicides over cyber bullying. This is where people bully kids over the internet. Also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming. this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions. Also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life. There are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites. Most people actually get addicted to the game, They would play it all day if they could and if they arent playing they are wishing they could. This makes them miss out on alot of things. They might not get enough excersise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop. They could also not be spending time with family. It also might change who you are as a person. The most important thing about the use of computers is your safety. There are predator all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live. You should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online. They can and most likely will come to your house for you. It could most likely cost you or even family members your lives. Computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it. Remember not to tell anyone where you live or dont take pictures and send them that are personal. They could be all over the internet the next day. Lastly, worry about your family, grades, and health than some useless game. Be smart and safe!.Isn't it a tuff life?.What a swell party this is!.It's your last buck to Jacksonville   Are you my sweet baby, are you still?.Pull me up up up up up up up up   I slipped, and I got pulled,   Pulled up, I tripped, and then you pulled,   You pulled me up   I tripped, and I got pulled   Pulled up, I slipped, and then you pulled   You pulled me up!.M sure that it will take some time   Until?.Joe has just learned to speak German..Honey, put on that party dress..Right here, right where?.This is a nightmare, won't be your last..[Verse 2 (Black Rob)]      I feel like this approach me with beef ya done   I shoot through pants no chance to pull for ya gun   Man a lot of y'all cats can't stand that 1 on 1   Wind up gettin' embarrassed ain't funny uh huh   Despite the bullshit black still here   Makin' hits down at Chelsea Bea's   Via partaking flicks   No matter what we have to   Come strapped with our gats   We don't want to   But y'all make us act like that   It's a thousand Bad Boy cats ready to blam you   La Familia I steal ya I know how my fam' do   Man handle tracks that be laced by Nas   Rolex watch security straight from the Mosque   Yo I'm all on my own G who should I trust   niggas bust B.

"Dear Newspaper, I think people need computers. It helps them see the world if they can't. It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. So here is examples of these three things. Some people can't physically or mentally and can't afford to travel. Its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can't go places. But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they've never been to which can help them see the world better. But there are people who can help them see the world better. But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. Then there are people who can't afford it. So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. What happened and that it wasn't what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can't talk or see them. Someones in the military and he/she has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. Also you see a friend in facebook who you haven't seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. It can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world.

"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad it does not rot you brain like video games. are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination. You use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for @DATE1, computers can also help you read better it has little . You could play talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to you could a website that has all songs that you like to listen yo many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out paying bills online is easyer than paying them for real.

"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great effects that are positive towards people. This is @CAPS3 it teaches hand eye cordanation, allows people to learn about far away places, and to talk to other people online. Computers have great positive effects for everyone. Computers teach hand eye cordanation. When a person is typing they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters. Computer games help to teach this @CAPS3 in the game things happen very quickly so the person has to ee whats going on and click the correct key fast thus improving hand eye @CAPS1 greatly. Studys do show that people who use computers have a @PERCENT1 better hand eye @CAPS1 then some one who dosen't. Coumputers help hand eye @CAPS1 and they can teach you about far away places. Someone can learn about far away places by searching it up online. They will get many facts about that place. Sheral from @LOCATION4 said ""I heard some one at school mention @LOCATION2 and didn't know a thing about it so I searched it and got a ton of facts."" This shows the computer can help someone learn about foiren countrys and they can talk to people far away. Using the computer soemone could talk to you while your hundreds or thousands of miles away. Tehy can do this through e-mail of video chat. a @CAPS2 showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat @CAPS3 its faster and the two people can see each other. However either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS3 of video chat I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3 who I almost never see. This gos to show that the computer is a positive thing for people. The computer is helpful in so many ways it teaches hand eye cordniation, it allows people to learn about far away places and it allows for people to talk to other people.

"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world..And had we found?.And you may never come back again..[Chorus]      I asked my gal to marry me, reckon what she said,   She said I wouldn't marry you, if all the rest were dead..I was falling for some time   Passing others, as they'd climb   In a moment very clear   You seemed to beckon, come here dear      Emma, sure as the sun's shining on you   I can tell I'm in your spell   Emma you're the one, oh      If they ever change your mind   Try to leave it all behind   If there ever comes a time   You go your way, and I'll go mine      Emma, sure as the moon circles over   Heaven knows, that's how it goes   Emma you're the one, oh      I can tell I'm in your spell   Emma, you're the one, oh   Emma, Emma, Emma....I like to think that I'm a pretty good kisser   I like to think I maybe broke a few hearts   But since I met you I'm a victim of disaster   I like to think I got it down to an art      So, here's where the problem starts   You're shitting on my heart   Oh, I can't take it   Again and again and again      All I wanted from you   Was a night, maybe two   You beat me at my own game   No it's not okay   I'm the one that's missing out   All I needed to do   Was get just a taste of you   And now I'm sick all in my head   You poisoned me instead   Trust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down      I like to wake and go to bed around whenever   I like to maybe come and go when I choose   But now I'm waiting for a text, call, whatever   What's gotten into me, besides you?.Something burning deep inside of me   Ran into three Puerto Ricans those girls took us to the fun house   I don't wanna be alone again   Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway   Cars passin' by but none of them seem to go my way   And New York City well I wish I was on a highway   Back to Olympia.No, it's much better to face these kinds of things   With a sense of   Poise and Rationality!.For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals   Then something happenend which unleashed the power of our imagination   We learned to talk      There's a silence surrounding me   I can't seem to think straight   I'll sit in the corner   No one can bother me      I think I should speak now   Why won't you talk to me   I can't seem to speak now   You never talk to me      My words won't come out right   What are you thinking   I feel like I'm drowning   What are you feeling      I'm feeling weak now   You never talk to me   But I can't show my weakness      What are you thinking   I sometimes wonder   What are you feeling      Where do we go from here      It doesn't have to be like this   All we need to do is make sure we keep talking      Why won't you talk to me   I feel like I'm drowning   You never talk to me   You know I can't breathe now      What are you thinking   We're going nowhere   What are you feeling   We're going nowhere      Why won't you talk to me   You never talk to me   What are you thinking   Where do we go from here      It doesn't have to be like this   All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.I still remember   All of those faces   And now all I have is memories..Oh, daddy..Help!.86 proof anesthetic crutches   Brought you to the top   Where the smiles are all synthetic   And the ulcers never stop   When they take that final inventory   Yours will be the same   Sad story everywhere -   No one will really care..I'm on my knees and burning..Let it be, let it be,   Whisper words of wisdom, let it be..Show us what you got,   What you're holding..Even though you're finally free   Don't it make you lonely, lonely like me?...Commando girls...

"Dear Newspaper, In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. @CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people? Go and talk to them in real life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go.

"According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out @MONEY1 @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to eachother face to face anymore. They all talk on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Commmunities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, ther spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provides financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the commputer..I reach but I feel only air at night..Why try holding back the wave?.Keep it on your head Hollywood is dead..I take you out all over town   But you always start sittin' down   You never move, baby what's wrong with me?.Ba ba baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Ba ba Baduwa Taa!.[Chorus]      (C'mon baby got to keep moving),   I'm taking it step by step), bit by bit,   Stone by stone (yeah, stone by stone), brick by brick   C'mon baby,   Step by step keep on moving, day by day (day by day-ee),   Mile by mile by mile by mile,go your own way,   C'mon baby got to keep moving, bit by bit (bit by bit, bit by bit).In fact it's just a big mistake..Everyone you meet   They're jamming in the street   All night long1   Yeah, I said, everyone you meet   They're jamming in the street   All night long!.Oh, why is everything so confusing?.She told me more than once to take it slow   And I said OK..There's a place in the world for the angry young man   With his working class ties and his radical plans   He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl   And he's always at home with his back to the wall..Sippin' passion wit' a stranger in the club,   It doesn't necessarily equate to love..The bridge was falling down   And that took a lot of lies   And it made me lonely   Ooh baby, ooh baby..I don't buy your true life stories   'cause I've seen the way you lie   but I don't mind the things you tell me   because I know we'll say anything to get by      but when we're together   somehow I feel better   my disease always tricks me   I believe you can fix me      you're insane   I love the drama   tell the truth   you love it too, I know you do?.Tears from my eyes keep on falling   cause you are leaving, leaving with another   Things that we've done together   I'll always remember though you're with another, baby..If you're lonely   And need a friend   And troubles seem like   They never end   Just remember to keep the faith   And love will be there to light the way      [Chorus]   Anytime you need a friend   I will be here   You'll never be alone again   So don't you fear   Even if you're miles away   I'm by your side   So don't you ever be lonely   Love will make it alright      When the shadows are closing in   And your spirit diminishing   Just remember you're not alone   And love will be there   To guide you home      [Chorus]      If you just believe in me   I will love you endlessly   Take my hand   Take me into your heart   I'll be there forever baby   I won't let go   I'll never let go      Anytime you need a friend   I will be here   You'll never be alone again   So don't you fear   Even if you're miles away   I'm by your side   So don't you ever be lonely   It's alright   It's alright.[Chorus]      In the future,   Everybody will be anonymous for fifteen minutes,   You are, we all are a test card,   The stars of CCTV,   We ARE the nature of the beast..Wooo, they do it, they do it, they do it, they do it..With all your cheap words   Who are you kidding?.Herod the king in his regime charged he hath this day,   His men of night, in his own sight, all children young to slay..Wild eyes forever   Built to punish and persuade."
"Some of you @MONTH1 agree that computers don't keep you fit or we spend too much time on them but, they can help you keep in touch with friends and family, meet new people, and save information. Without these important technology devices we wouldn't be able to do any of these things. Most families live all over the country @MONTH1 be even in another country, and you don't get to see them very often because of traveling prices, however with the computer they can help us keep in contact with them very easy and quicker than you can say ""@LOCATION1."" @CAPS1 more people make a website that allows us to easily keep up with our distant family. Facebook, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 of fish, and singles net are all sites that you can find friends or the one that's right for you. This gives you a chance to discover @CAPS1 people with the same interest as you. Half of my mom's boyfriends were from these sites. Without these sites there might be less divorces and more happy ending fairy tales. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people work out home. It's good and you can get things done the. Many people have papers and of important information and it could be lost in a blink of an eye. With technology like this they save with just a click of that mouse. More buisnesses are being held at their households because of this easy going technology. Exercise @MONTH1 be important still, with a touch of a button I could talk to my aunt, find the right one for me and save my whole life.

"As time goes on, our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology, such as the television. What I really want to write about is the computer. Society today has developed a very unhealthy habit, and it is always using the computer. Everyone in the twenty first century uses a computer. The world got so used to having the computer around, that if all the computers in the world were to ""break,"" then most people probably would not know how to @CAPS2. Like the basic theory of. Which was that the world was ""@CAPS1"" to end back in the year two-thousand because everyone thought that the world was going to end. Only because the computer were going to crash and lose all the data that we have ever recorded. Humanity relies way to much on the computer. Since many people rely on the computer to @CAPS2, a lot of people ""forget"" to excersise! Our body needs excersise to live. Excersise one of the most important activities in our daily lives. When you don't excersise, and all you do is eat junk food and drink today, you better bet on your mothers grave that your going to either get diabetes, the fly, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it, why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an ""innocent"" invention. Now a days, people literally worship the computer like it is a @CAPS3. People who use the computer all day every day, end becoming very lazy, because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity. Whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active atleast three times a week for many reason, fact is, that if you excersise three times a week at the least, that your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. excersise can be fun, as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. excersise should be a huge part of your daily routine, now sitting on your buttox all day searching pointless videos on ""youtube."" The way you want to live your life is up to you. And I hope to @CAPS3 that you start living it healthier..There's a crack in the mirror..Girl let down your guard..Let the lights grow dim,   I've been ready..[Harry:]   'Cause it's gotta be you   It's gotta be you   Only you   Only you      It's gotta be you   Only you   It's gotta be you   Only you.Nobody gonna steal that woman, nobody for sure..There's a brand new dance   That just hit this town   Makes you feel so good      This dance they call the round and round   Round and round, up and down   Round and round, up and down   You know the kids got a bloodhound   Out on the playing ground      And when they want to have some fun   They start to goin round and round   Round and round, up and down   Round and round, up and down   I got an elevator man   In the heart of town      And when he's feeling right   He will carry you round and round   Round and round, up and down   Round and round, up and down   Baby don't be jealous   When I come to town      I'm just a country girl   Everybody's tryin' to push poor me around   Round and round, up and down   Round and round, up and down.Baby stop it,stop it, stop it,   girl you're heading for a danger zone..Chamberlain had his paper   Jesus had his cross   They held on   We held on to what?.Blowing my mind..So I packed my bags   Brushed my cap   Walked out into the world   Seventeen years old   Never kissed a girl   Took the train to Voronezh   That was as far as it would go   Changed my sacks for a uniform   Bit my lip against the snow   I prayed for mother Russia   In the summer of '43   And as we drove the Germans back   I really believed   That God was listening to me   We howled into Berlin   Tore the smoking buildings down   Raised the red flag high   Burnt the reichstag brown   I saw my first American   And he looked a lot like me   He had the same kinda farmer's face   Said he'd come from some place called Hazzard, Tennessee   Then the war was over   My discharge papers came   Me and twenty hundred others   Went to Stettiner for the train   Kiev!.[Chorus].(C.

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be to much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. But add to that the imense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly..The less I need the more I get   Make me chaste but not just yet   It's a promise or a lie I'll repent before I die      The minute I saw her face,

And I leave work at five-o-five   Been doing my best to forget about her   But she's driving me out of my mind      When I get home, I know what I'll find   How I wish that it wasn't so   There'll be no one there to hold me tonight   In that house on old lonesome road      I recall how we laughed   When we read the name   In the paper before we moved in   And after we did our friends all asked   If that house was lonesome back then      We were so young, our dreams were so new   There's just no way that we could have known   The irony of the place where we loved   That house on old lonesome road      It's only shingles and shutters   And a case of worn out stairs   Just like my old heart they need repair   Maybe I should sell it   Yeah, maybe that would be the best   Maybe then someone else could find   Some love at that address      I used to love that old house so much   Back before she went away   Now everything there is just gathering dust   I should clean it up if I'm gonna stay      But I don't have too much time anymore   I'm too busy talking to ghosts   'Cause her memory, keeps me company   In that house on old lonesome road      It's only shingles and shutters   And a case of worn out stairs   Just like my old heart they need repair   Maybe I should sell it   Yeah, maybe that would be the best   Maybe then someone else could find   Some love at that address      Every night it's the same old plan   And I leave work at five-o-five   Been doing my best to forget about her   But she's driving me out of my mind.Ready for me?.You said, ""I lied""   You screamed, I cried   You packed your things   You wanna leave   You get the car keys   And headed for the door      Chorus   Now, I'm down on my knees   I'm beggin' you please   Don't go, don't go   Don't give up on us now   We can work it out   Don't go, don't go      Maybe I'm wrong and you're right   I said ""I'm sorry""   No, I don't wanna fight   Just calm down   And hold me close   And dry the tears in my eyes      [Repeat chorus]      Bridge   Why can't we kiss and make up   I don't want to ever break up   Why can't we forgive and forget   And stay together      [Repeat chorus]      [Repeat chorus on the background]   Don't go   I'm down on my knees   Oh, baby, I'm beggin' you please   I'm beggin' you please   Don't go   Don't, don't go.Whack for my daddy-o,   Whack for my daddy-o..There were six of us all together....One too many.If you see me walking down the street   And I start to cry each time we meet   Walk on by, walk on by   Make believe      That you don't see the tears   Just let me grieve   In private 'cause each time I see you   I break down and cry      And walk on by (don't stop)   And walk on by (don't stop)   And walk on by   I just can't get over losing you      And so if I seem broken and blue   Walk on by, walk on by   Foolish pride   Is all that I have left      So let me hide   The tears and the sadness you gave me   When you said goodbye   Walk on by      And walk on by   And walk by (don't stop)   Walk on by, walk on by   Foolish pride      Is all that I have left   So let me hide   The tears and the sadness you gave me   When you said goodbye      Walk on by (don't stop)   And walk on by (don't stop)   And walk by (don't stop).In my sorrow now I turn to you   Please answer me   My love..We look forward to our home-coming?.So I stayed up and read,

never ever turn it round   You may say it took you by surprise   Never ending   Never changing   I didn't see through your disguise   It took my breath away      Under my feet   The earth shook   Under my feet   The earth just fell away   Under my feet   Gave way      Did you ever want to take a chance   Never thought the time would come round   Quite so fast   Would you walk right thro' that wall   And keep on walking till you   Couldn't stand on your feet no more   But you came and took me by surprise   When you stole up on me   I didn't see thro' your disguise   It took my breath away      Under my feet   The earth shook   Under my feet   The earth just fell away   Under my feet - gave way      Where were you   When I needed you   Where were you   When I needed you   Where were you   Where were you - I'm holding on      Under my feet   The earth shook   Under my feet   The earth just fell away   Under my feet - gave way      Under my feet   The earth shook   Right under my feet   Gave way.In the eyes of the lonely one   Everything is cold and hopeless that he looks   upon   He needs a friend a lover who can comfort him   His deeds offend he knows that he has brought   on him..Since you took it right on the chin   You have lost that bright toothpaste grin   My mental state is all a-jumble   I sit around in sadly mumble   Fools rush in, so here I am!"
"Dear, @CAPS1 I would like to tell you something. Throughout the ages we have been evolving, from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly. With evoloution we discovered technology and in recent years we have been making new technologies rapidly. Some say that some technology like computers are bad, I think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about for away places. let you talk to people online and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers let you go places that you ordinarilly wouldn't be able to go to. If you were doing a research projects on @LOCATION1 and you didn't have any books what would you use? That's right, a computer the internet would have the facts you needed, so you could grade. While on the internet you could talk to friends and family who @MONTH1 live for away. The computer goes over long distances and connects both computers so you can bend writing almost instantly. Without computers you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people. Using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. It helps you with your hand-eye coordination. When you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body. Some people say that when you are on the computer you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. I myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too! I love computers, don't you?.And no one learned from your mistakes,   The little profits go to waste..(Peter Allen)      We'll go away   Make love all day   You'll never stay   But it's a nice dream

 Too good we couldn't last   Oh, and now we see   With you and me   One's gotta let go   But it's a nice dream   Oh, baby, such a nice dream      So, kiss me goodbye   I'm sorry that it went so fast   Our future has become our past   Too good we couldn't last   Mmm, and now we see   With you and me   One's gotta let go   And let the other go free   Aah, in love we'll still be   Oh, it proves it was real   It was a real nice dream.Monday, Monday   So good to me..(initiate radar)      Your eyes say it all (all)   All   They're fixed upon an object of desire   You can't control (control)   No (No)

today..I have a version of Elvis Presly doing this song, but I think it's a traditional, also known as 'i Wish I Was An Apple', or as 'Sydney'..But we're always changing   It does not bother me to say this isn't love   Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love   And I guess I'm going to have to live with that   But, I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey or something in between   And I can always change my name if that's what you mean      My friend assures me ""It's all or nothing""   But I am not really worried, I am not overly concerned   You try to tell yourself the things you tell yourself to make yourself forget   I am not worried   ""If it's love"", she said, ""then were gonna have to think about the   consequences""   She can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and......I just can't help thinking   What you've done to me   You built a wall of love and tore it right down   In front of me   And you think you know what's going on   You keep telling me that I am wrong   I don't care about what you do   'Cause if you mess with me I'll get rid of you      The picture you see is no portrait of me   It's too real to be shown to someone I don't know   And it's driving me wild   It makes me act like a child      You think I am crazy, but what can I do   You waste your time, like my money   It ain't so funny, but it's true   (Don't waste my money, baby)   Now you can't tell me what's going on   And that I am weak while you are strong   What is it you need, that makes your heart bleed   Do you really know?.Just when it falls apart

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, yes, I do believe that for too many people are 'addicted' to the computer, and spread more than enough time on the computer everyday! Not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer all I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before I now believe the computer takes time away from family time to get the sitting down to read a good book and hanging out with friends. Insteed of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook, myspace, twitter, youtube, addicting games, and whatever else they could find. I do not agree with that being sluck to the computer like is to chese. No! If there was our thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distracts kids and teenagers from doing other things in life, also it doesn't follow families to be a family. Before computers were made all people bad was their family. Coming home from school saying ""@CAPS3 dad, home from school. What t go play see catch""? Instead of that kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to your facebook message. Computers also cutt off interacting time that families always and to have. @DATE1 @TIME1 instead of talking to @CAPS5 myspace, why don't you grab and plays family board game! Or go out to on restaurant, talk about your next vacation and what you'd be interseted doing go to the same field have a game, or to your local base ball field and play kickball, instead of sitting there mesmerized by the computer screen! Okay, I @MONTH1 understand that some people just @MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise and that is totally understandable that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer and a book. Reading is yet fun but it is also , with out being in school! As you read your brain to inner works, you or your so you can show off to you friends out family on words that you . It is shown that @PERCENT1 of strints who read . Not the @PERCENT2 who sit at the computer all day writing reply ..[Chorus:]   Babe break me off a piece of your love   Once it's on I can't seem to get enough   So keep it up, keep it comin', uh what   Break me off some baby      You're wicked, baby so do what's right   Break me off a piece of that love tonight   Like a steel guitar that I love to play   Everyone loves Jesus on judgment day   You get hot just like gasoline   In your cashmere shirt and your cut-off jeans   I've been workin' all day, here's what I made   Baby what you say break me off some      [Chorus: Repeat 2X]      Down in Mexico there's a man I know   Who gave away his future for a piece of gold   He washed his hands in Noah's flood   Now those mountains they're just red as blood   I left this place just to come with you   Walkin' off the mesa in some dead man's shoes   I've been workin' all day, here's what I made   Baby what you say break me off some      [Chorus: Repeat 2X]      Eie yie yie yie yie yie yie   Eie yie yie yie yie yie yie      I like the way you're movin' on the dance floor baby   I like the way you're moving' on the dance floor baby      Shake shake shake 'til my eyes are sore baby   Shake shake shake 'til my eyes are sore baby      Bounce bounce bounce 'til your body is sore baby   Bounce bounce bounce 'til your body is sore baby   Feel the heat Moe Z Put his hands on      [Chorus: Repeat 2X].No one knows how to shoulder the blame   Or learn from past mistakes....Oh but it's been such a long, long time..Doin' stick ups for moneys   Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)   Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,   You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat..What began as laughter   So soon would turn to pain..Almighty power, building higher, you'll never be the same!.(Steam engines)Gotta keep on keep on rollin'..Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies      [Chorus]      I reach my peak, I can't speak,   Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak   I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'   Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' [echoes].Cavaliers three cheers, wackier head gears,   We live to boogie with our peers..But you're holding on stronger,      And oh how hard it is to let go..No glory   Scene III, the pimpin?.Listenin' to hip-hop, listening to be-bop and jazz   Ella made you move that ass   Sensation for the people, insperation for the sisters and brothers   Smooth jazz for the midnight lovers   Savoy was the spot for shakin' on your rump and   Ella made it hoppin'   Got the joint jumpin', remembering you 'til the dawn   Because Ella your memory goes on      She spoke her mind (yeah...and it just don't stop)   She's Ellamental to the art (the memory goes on and on...'cause it just don't stop)   She spoke her mind (...yeah..jazz to the bebop)   She's Ellamental to the art   She spoke her mind..(yeah...much love...)

"Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of. I hope that my lette and probably many others show you about computers actually do..Dance, let's move..I've got you under my skin,   I've got you deep in the heart of me,   So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me,   I've got you under my skin!.You've been right and I've been wrong,   I've been weak and you've been strong..Kiss it better   Kiss it better      Doesn't it taste like holy water?.Where did you come from?.Swingin' doors   Neon lights   Hardwood floors   It's Saturday night   Got on my dancing boots   I've got a cold Lonestar   I've got a two steppin' mind   And a honky tonk heart      I've got a two steppin' mind And a honky tonk heart   I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar   Someone to hold when the music starts   I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart      It's happy hour when I get there   Pretty girls, man they're everywhere   There ain't no way to keep us apart   I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart      I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart   I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar   Someone to hold when the music starts   I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart      I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart   I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar   Someone to hold when the music starts   I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart   Hey, I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart.I love you just a little too much,   Love you just a little too much, much..Chaos come onto me..If you're in a bind,with a troubled mind   I'm a mountain,come on and climb   Because you look so good,to be so down   It won't take much girl,to turn it all around      [Chorus]   Come with me,come with me   The feeling's free,just come with me   Will get on a cloud girl,and ride it high   Say hello sun,as we sail bye      I'll take you where,you've never been before   Once we're there,you'll cry for more   If it's dark in your world,come walk in mine   My love's a light babe,it's on all the time      [Chorus: x 2].Yeah, too much   Outta sight   You're so down home girl.The whole earth overflowing   With your power and your glory   There is no one like You God   There is no one like You God      Mountains bow nations tremble   At your feet we cry Holy   There is no one like you God   There is no one like you God      Let creation sing of the risen king   Let the universe resound   With a shout of love   We will give to You   All the highest praise      Let your light shine upon us   Let your light shine upon us   For the glory of your name   Will be over all the earth      Forever, forever I'll sing   Forever, forever I'll sing.And when the saints go marching home,   Does he just sit and smoke a bone.Oh there ain't no reason for you to declare war on the one who loves you so..Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,   Is a man who swears he's not to blame..Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow   You still wander the fields of your sorrow      One day you're a hero   Next day you're a clown   There's nothing that is in between   Now you're a 21st century man..Everyday and night I pray   Love will swing you back this way   Life without you here with me   Ain't the same without you G      Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you   Baby come and talk to me   Let me know what's on your mind   Every time I see you   You're running from me all the time      Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you   I only wanted you to be happy   You to have the best of things   To be down with me, baby   'Cause your lovin', it's so good      You're giving me the run-around   Thought our love was going down   Baby don't you know   That I'm down until the day I die   Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you   Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you   'Cause baby I love you      Every night and day I pray   Your love returns   Oh I'd give my life   If it would only make you happy      [Notorious B.

"Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from school and go on aim. So they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obiese. I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun. Also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together. The kids will see more nature and be bale to learn more about animals. When kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing. ALso some kids post pictures of themselves on things like facebook that are not appropriate and cna get them in lots of trouble. They also say things that they wouldn't normally say to a persons face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble. Whne your outside palying baseball, football or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and your having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obies. Some say the computer is good hand eye coordination but catching a football or hitting is bettre. Also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends is better than talking in your friends or video chatting with them, @CAPS2 are to many over weight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not heloing the cause. .[Verse 3]   Concrete kiss - hey   Come on and do the twist: radio   My little exorcist, we're all getting pissed   And everybody's bouncing off the walls      [Chorus 1 - 2x]

"Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research. Without computers, kids an adults won't be provided with the necissary tools for knowledge. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home and that @NUM3 person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects. Another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together. Facbook, @CAPS2, and twitter users can chat with people accross the street, accross the country and even accross the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION3! My last reason is that computers are great for buiesnessess. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their buisness is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper. Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but thats them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people! They give us research, they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world..It's the greatest show with the best effects   Since Disco-Tex and Sexelettes

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think its a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because it does teach kids something, it good to do homework on and you can relax when your on it. Well computers teaches kids a lof of things like hand-eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it. There is also websites that can show you how to move yor hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the comptuer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dont have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time. That is why I think you should keep computers and not exercise as much. We get enuf of that in school carry all these heveay books around..[Hook:]   There's a bad bunch of bitches rolling with me on my side   I know I gotta choose em when bitches look me in my eyes   Wordplay so sick, I can change?.There's a leafless tree in Asia..But you're the only one responsible to take the blame..We go dancing, and everything is fine,   We're romancing, the music is divine,   Then the band starts to syncopate,   You jump from thirty three to seventy eight..For now and always   I'll hold you tight day and night   Keep the love light burnin' bright in my heart for you      Pretty little sweetheart   I'll love you for now and always   I'll break a date to roller skate   To sit up late just to wait at the gate for you      Pretty little sweetheart   I'll love you for now and always   For your sake time I'll take a pretty bungalow   I'll even learn to make for you      Pretty little sweetheart   I'll love you for now and always   I'll do my work like a Turk   I'll never shirk, I'll be a butcher boy or clerk for you      Love is like a roller coaster   Running upside down   Gonna make a great big poster   Spread the news around      For now and always   You'll always be the one for me   Can't you see that I'll always be in love with you?.Not under your command,   I know where I stand..Was he a saint?.Do we not love her I think we all tell you about   Do we have to roam the world to prove how much it hurts?.But you never do,   Stand up to the ones that keep you down,   Now you can see right through it all..""What's becoming of the children?"".You better knock, knock on wood, baby..I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love..Until the philosophy which hold one race superior   And another   Inferior   Is finally   And permanently   Discredited   And abandoned   Everywhere is war   Me say war..Analyzing and implying, you know      People just love to play with words   People just love to play, haven't you heard?.Two, one,      no they must see but no, they can't test me..What?.[singing]   Take the someone whose arms you're in   Hold onto her tight and spin   And one two three, one two three, one two three      [Cornelius:]   Look, I'm dancing!.He stood in a field where barley grows..Yeah Jonah he lived in a whale   Yet he made his home in that   Fish's abdomen..Didja' ever get one of them days, boy?.Don't get caught with your fingers in my pie."
"Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are a great machine to use. People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the great inventions we have. They are very helpul in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. If your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. Also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things. Finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is @CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want your friends you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpul in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends I hope, you see my point at view they are samething everyone should have..Would you?.Another day goes by, little time machine,   I'm raking my brain over what it might mean   Just to claim the time and to turn away,   To make today today..Keep on stirring my malted milk, mama,   Until I change my mind..Ahh!.Will all your money   Keep you from madness   Keep you from sadness   When you're down in the hole?.Is it that time again?.Love you like no other baby,   Like no other can,   Love you like no other baby,   Like no other can..Rage!.Desperate men, desperate women divided,   Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves..What would you think if I told you that I   Wake up every morning with a different girl   Cause I don't wanna settle down before I see the world!.My face like a mannequin..Oh greed oh yes   Yeah!.You got me hypnotized,   I'm in love again..In a world as cold as stone,   Must I walk this path alone?.Booze and ladies are his fate, ooh   Too much sex and food and Rock 'n' Roll      He's looking for trouble day by day.Hammer, you know I'm looking,   Calling all my friends all around the place,   Guy, Lavertte, or my homey Rob Base,   (have you seen her?).Hey, I really wish that they would all just go away   'Cause all I really want to be just like them   Just wanna be just like them...   And I'm so sick and tired of all those stupid things you say   And this monkey sitting on my back just won't go away   And I'm standing here with my dick in my hand   Waiting for an invitation to the promised land..Breathe on me, breath of God,   Fill me with life anew,   That I may love what Thou dost love,   And do what Thou wouldst do..Oh, show me the way to the next whiskey bar   Oh, don't ask why, oh, don't ask why!.Bye bye baby, take me on a highway   This time it could be heaven   Even for a little while, didn't want to miss you   Maybe I can make you feel fine   I don't know what you want me to do   But I'm losing control of my senses   And I know I've been counting on you   Just to show that you really care   I can see that your star is ascending over me   But I don't wanna go there   'Cause I'm feeling so scared   I've had enough of this love   And you calling the shots outta thin air   And I'm full of emotion   When you don't believe me   'Cause baby, here comes a crash   And I'm dying inside when you leave me   I don't know what you're putting me through   But it seems that the party is over   In and out of love with you   And I think that I'm losing my mind   I can see that your star is ascending over me   But I don't wanna go there   'Cause I'm feeling so scared   I've had enough of this love   And you calling the shots outta thin air   And I'm full of emotion   When you don't believe me   'Cause baby, here comes a crash   And I'm dying inside when you leave me   But I don't wanna go there   'Cause I'm feeling so scared   I've had enough of this love   And you calling the shots outta thin air   And I'm full of emotion   When you don't believe me   'Cause baby, here comes a crash   And I'm dying inside when you leave me   But I don't wanna go there   'Cause I'm feeling so scared   I've had enough of this love   And you calling the shots outta thin air.He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone."
"Dear computer co., computers have a negative effect. Why would you go outside if you could play life - like games on your @CAPS1? I lthink that the games on th @CAPS1 should be removed so people could enjoy all of the great things in life.

"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 opinion's on what effect's do computer's have on people is without the computer we couldn't research important people and event's. Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that @CAPS1 first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example who is harry @PERSON1. He was the @NUM1 president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can alway's excrise around there house or around there block..Experience pleasures thought unobtained..I hear your heartbeat,

Do you want to, if you want to, take what you need      Do you want to make it alright   Do you want to heaven is tonight   Oh baby, do you want to, if you want to, take what you need      I hear your

Tells a different tale   Each photo on the mantel   Sweet memories that never will go stale      I've been climbing up the walls again   Living with a memory that might have been   So pick me up on a weekday night   We'll get together and ride around in   The black and white      I've been thinking about the good old days   My silly clothes and my silly ways   Each drunken drugstore purchase   Each chemical advance   Seven days a weekend   Everday the same old dizzy dance.I told you motherfuckers I'll be right back (jea)   Shooting dice in my hood must of lost 8 stacks   (whew)   Ain't

"Dear Newspaper, I think computer use is good because, it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. Also people will have the ability to learn about different states and countries. I ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns. Those are all the reasons why I think computers are a good use. The first reason why I think people should use computers is it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. People will know how to stay focussed with their eyes and also know how to also use their hands all at the same time. To stay focussed with their eyes people would have to wear glasses for the light. Also so when they are typing they wont have to keep looking down all the time. When people coordinate with their hands on the computer its so they know were the different are thats why computers are good. My second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries. They can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look. Also they will be able to read about what different cultures they have and religions. In the states also be to read about @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and how we have a wonderful state. That's why computers are good use. My final reason why the use of computers is good because, people can interact with their family and friends online. There are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends. You can talk to each other. Also you can talk to them even if their in a different state. You guys can talk about a lot of different things. For example, the family and life and even if you miss them. Thats why computers are good. Those are my reasons why computers are good. Not only can it teach you about hand-eye coordination, family and friends, and about different states. But also you can play a lot of different games and also type on an notepad. Also if your stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator. That's why people should use the computers..Sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation   And let your laughter fill the air   Sing that sweet, sweet song of salvation   And tell the people everywhere

"Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet, also you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, webchat and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. You can personally see someone from acroos the @ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and @CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Business also use webchatting, as I previously state, for conference calls. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, connect humans with each from half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. @CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?.'Cause I drink a bit..Someone has eaten the cookies..Is this love?.Please Mr. DJ   Tell me if you hear me   Turn the music up      Hey Mr..You don't know a thing about me   Is there something that you should know?.Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving   He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling   He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game   He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same   There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us   So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus      And it's all over now   Don't you worry no more   Gonna go west to the sea   The greyhound is swaying   And the radio is playing   Some blues for baby and me      And the highway looks like it never did   Lord it looks so sweet and so free   And I can't forget that trip to the west   Singing blues for baby and me      Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise   It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky   I called you my child, said honey now this is our game   There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again   There's a greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us   So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus.I don't belive you wanna leave like this, I can't beleive I just had my   Last real kiss..Any news was good news   And the feeling was bad at home   I was out of mind and you   Were on the phone   Lonnie was the kingpin   Back in nineteen sixty-five   I was singing this song   When Lonnie came alive      [Chorus]   Bring back the Boston Rag   Tell all your buddies   That it ain't no drag   Bring back the Boston Rag      You were Lady Bayside   There was nothing that I could do   So I pointed my car down   Seventh Avenue   Lonnie swept the playroom   And he swallowed up all he found   It was forty-eight hours til   Lonnie came around      [Chorus].Baby, just stay with me a little longer   Baby, I'll guarantee the feeling stronger   You don't know what you do to me   I wanna be inside you, baby      Baby, just stay with me a little longer   Baby, I'll guarantee we'll get it on   Read my mind and I know you'll find   I wanna be inside you, baby      There ain't nothing but love inside you, girl   And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me, baby   Stay with me a little longer, baby, I'll guarantee we'll get it on   All I know is what you do to me, I wanna be inside you, baby      There ain't nothing but love inside you, girl   And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me   Baby, just stay with me a little longer   Baby, I'll guarantee the feeling stronger   You don't know what you do to me   I wanna be inside you, baby      Baby, just stay with me a little longer   Baby, I'll guarantee we'll get it on   There ain't nothing but love inside you, girl   And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me, baby      Baby, just stay with me a little longer   Baby, I'll guarantee the feeling stronger   You don't know what you do to me   I wanna be inside you, baby.Who were you?.And she will always tell you every thing that she believes..I said, sometimes I go see baby,   And sometimes baby come see me..Or keep on day dreaming?.Satan is working day and night Doing the best he can To destroy what jah created   Trying by all means   To get us off the way, Rastafari...

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying "",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!"" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, amking many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see.

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion @CAPS3 as to why some people support advances in technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people is that I disagree. Some people dont even get enough sleep if they stay up too late on computers. Also they spend less time exersizing and less time interacting with family and friends. Thos are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph I am going to tell you about why I think that people should @CAPS4 other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy dont blame them the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer? Well once I stayed at @CAPS1 friends house and she was up on the computer all night she didnt even get any sleep. In the morning she was soo grumpy because she was soo tired. @CAPS1 languege arts teacher ""@PERSON1"" says that ""@CAPS2 up late on the computer all night isnt healthy because you get bugs under your eyes and youre sleepy. I mean theres a whole lot of side effects."" @NUM1 out of @PERCENT1 of parents agree with me and @CAPS1 first reason. In this paragraph I am telling you @CAPS1 second reason as @CAPS3 why I disagree which is less time excersizing. (@CAPS3 the parents) @CAPS4 you realy want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all days or @CAPS4 you want your kids to excersize and get healthier? @CAPS1 friends kids always are on the computer everyday all the time and thats not verry healthy @CAPS3 them especialy because they're young. So a couple of weeks ago I talked to them about being active and how its not good to be on the computer alot. Now they bearly go on the computer they always are outside and playing and running around. @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON3 says that ""@CAPS5 excersize is better than doing anything non active also it can be fun. @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. In this paragraph I am going to explain to you why I think interacting with family and friends is better than on the computer. If you were in your familys shoes @CAPS4 you think that they would rather have you come hang out with them or be on the computer? When I was younger @CAPS1 family used to have to yell at me to get me off the computer so I could hang out with them but finaly a day come when I got to understand their family pain. @CAPS1 mom says that ""I should hang out with @CAPS1 family and friends more often."" @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 conclusion I disagree with the statement ""Some people support advances and technology belive that computers have a positive effect on people."" @CAPS1 reason as @CAPS3 why is that people arent @CAPS5 enough sleep, less time excersizing, and less time interacting with friends and family..The little man had no gratitude..In which we're given paradise but only for a day?.They'll try to stop the dream we're dreamin'   But

"Computers, a very much talked about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and ""I.M.'s"", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""world of warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. It is things like this that make life that much easier for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. These are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. I know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. Being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. These are some of the reasons that I and others love computers. But I have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?.All night long, we'll be so high   That's the way we'll say goodbye..(Lee) No..Don't know, present time   Children of the other crime   All my dreams are wasting now   No more reason, see the cloud   As I watch you from the road   Find it open, Reason Man   Find it open, Reason Man      Moving in there's nothing to see   One look and you'll always regret   Thinking someone ought to hear   If you listen and only fear   Things were edging to the right   See him laughing, Reason Man   See him laughing, Reason Man      Ever infected all the time   Only boredom crime   Blessed with the feeling we will break      Now infecting Reason Man   Now infecting Reason Man.Sometimes you bite the bullet   And flip flop on the floor..Say no more, oh no more,   Well no more, oh, darling, oh!.Life is a short, warm moment   And death is a long cold rest..Welcome to The Uncle Bobo Show!.Baby, won't you come out tonight   Just come up the hill 'cause there's a full moon on the risin'   Hey baby, can't you steal away   You know I really need to see you tonight   I just got word you was packin' it in   What's the matter, this old town got you crazy again   I can see the sad look in your eyes   But I don't know how to say goodbye   And tomorrow, you're gonna have your day   Take your wife and you're gonna run away   Baby, while I'm wailin'   You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'   Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   Baby, won't you come out tonight   Oh baby, won't you come out tonight   We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight   Let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind   Oh baby, can I see you tonight   I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last   Good friends, they seem to slip away so fast   An' I know we're both headed down separate tracks   An' when ya' go, baby don't look back   There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night   No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight   No more dancin' after hours, singin' in the showers   Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'   Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight   Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight   I'll meet ya' on the corner   And you'll be there at midnight   Oh baby, can you steal away   You know I really want to see ya' tonight   Ooo baby, can you come out tonight   We'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight   Oh baby, can you steal away   I really wanna see you tonight   Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight   Come up the hill, there's a full moon on the rise   Oh baby, can ya' steal away   Baby, won't ya' come out tonight.I've seen butterflies galore   I've seen people big and small   I've still not found what I'm looking for   We're all looking for someone   We're all looking for someone   We're all looking for someone   Captain Scott, you were so bold   Now you're looking rather cold   Out there in the snow   What did you find there?.Promise I will be by your side (who would've thought baby)   I'll be everything you need to get by (missing you baby)   What I broke you know we finally mend (I need you baby)   Baby if we got together again (why me?).Remember what it's like when love is good,   And remember the chorus 'cause I wrote it for us..I'll take a rusty nail   And scratch your initials on my arm   And I'll show you how to sneak up   On the roof of the drugstore      Take the spokes from your wheelchair   And a magpies wings   And tie 'em to your shoulders and your feet!.Memories can't ignore   Anguish of before   Satisfy the scorn..And now I see, and now I know,   One touch of Your life,   Brings glory to my soul..Can you tie them in a knot?.Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't believe what he seen..When you see me comin' flying down the road   You know I ain't afraid to lay it down   Yea got me some leather..What a dumbass I am   I can't even rhyme these words   What a dumbass I am   I love napalm death      Even though napalm death sucks   Sucks large balls   Megadeth is way better   I hang out in malls      I'm an idiot   I watch looney tunes   I'm an idiot   I don't go to church   I'm an idiot   I like to smoke chairs   I'm an idiot   Shoot me please      I can't get a girlfreind   Because I suck   I like to screw goats   What a dumbass I am      I'm an idiot   I watch looney tunes   I'm an idiot   I don't go to church   I'm an idiot   I like to smoke chairs (don't ask me how)   I'm an idiot   Shoot me please!.I can make you do things you won't think you ever could.Mary did you know that your baby boy   Will one day rule the nations?.You really need to change that message."
"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are important for growth. They teach us skills like hand-eye coordination, they allow you to talk online, and learn about faraway people and places. I do believe that it benefits society even though many people dont. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine. I know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teamate passes the ball to him and he can't catch it because he has no hand-eye coordination skills. That wouldnt happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, that help build that up. When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination. out of @NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online. Its the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better and they tell you things that they dont want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Lets say you want to know about someone famous, you look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doning anyone good. Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We dont want out society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to furter our education or not?.Twenty four hours of every day   I'd walk on glass just to hear you say   Gettin' it on is like a drug to me

"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, In a pole conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people agreed that computers are a easier way to research than going to a library. Over the @DATE1 few years it has become a growing debate as to wheather computers are a benifit to socity or not. Today in america over @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer, according to the @ORGANIZATION1 are most definatly a benifit to today's socity for the reasons that it allows better and easier world comunications, makes text and information, more redily avalible to the public and allows the advancements in technology that are nessesary. Communication is a vital part @ORGANIZATION1 america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. @CAPS3 computers provide better and faster communication. They are also far more reliable. In the @DATE2's if you wanted to speech with some one who is far away you would have to send a letter.

Through the internet all the information @ORGANIZATION1 the world is available @NUM1./ Computers are also the former in todays technological advances. Computers allow us to have inventions that run there self so human operation is not nessisary. this same technology saves lives every day and alows us to create @ORGANIZATION3 better technology. As you can see computers are the greatest technology created in the @DATE1 and allows faster and more relible communication, is the greatest library the world has ever known, and allows for the creation @ORGANIZATION1 even more advanced technologies.

"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a lot of affects on people. Some affects are it takes away from family and friends, you don't really have a social life and you don't get enough excersise. Computers take away from friends and family time. I did an interview yesterday with @PERSON1; and I asked,"" @CAPS1 you go over your grandmas house what do you usually do?"" @CAPS2 said, ""I usually use the computer."" @CAPS3 do you want to use the computer while your their? your with your family your supposed to spend time with them. Play a game like monopoly, or play @CAPS4. Those are fun and great way to interact with your family. If your family member doesn't have those games bring them! People think that because there is facebook, aim, e-mail, and myspace that your interacting with friends. You really aren't. I asked my friend @PERSON3 what @CAPS2 thought of those things and @CAPS2 said ""They are great interacting websites."" They really aren't. They are websites on the computer. While you are on the computer your not really maintaing a social life. Your town holds activites or has a fun place you could too. Your town @MONTH1 have a gym, community center, or a library. Go their and hangout with friends interact with them. Go to school, goto the library, and hang out with friends are great ways to interact with people. People don't think about @CAPS1 your sititng in your computer chair and @CAPS5. While your sitting in the chair your not excercising, @CAPS1 you keep @CAPS5 your gaining weight. You might get fatter @CAPS1 your stuffing your face wih cheez- itz and not excersising I asked @PERSON2 a question it was what do you do while your on the computer? @CAPS2 said ""I eat.."" @CAPS5 isn't bad, but @CAPS1 your not really paying attention you eat more than you need. Your town has rec leaguges of sports such as @CAPS6, softball, and baseball. Join a team instead of playing on the computer and @CAPS5. Get @CAPS7! Computers aren't the greastest things in the world. You don't stay fit with them, you aren't very social, and you don't really spend time with your family. Computers don't really help you grow up, and be mature for the future..Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight..I'm no longer alone,   Think I've found me a home   And I

"Dear, local Newspaper @CAPS1 I read the article and I think that you guys are right because in the @DATE1 kids rather stay inside on the computer. @CAPS1 who know's what they do @CAPS1 some kids are on facebook all day some are on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. Sometimes kids dont even like to go do exercises they stay on the computer eating & eating. I think if their was no technology kids these days wont be beast. Some kids dont even like hanging out with their friends or family they say that they want to stay home on the computer but we should do more, exercises than being on the computer. If were always on the computer we wont learn nothing at school because when were at school kids could be thinking about going home to go on the computer and you wont focused on our education @CAPS1. And what if kids drop out or dont come to school anymore because they to be chatting with their friends or a stranger. What if a girl didn't want to go to school and on her computer.

"Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 and I am a @NUM1 year old girl; yet active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity. All of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay. I dont you want a happy and successful life?! I know I do!.I've gotta start facing up to what I really am..Sinner!.The street is dark here while I walk alone,   An' since you've gone, I always walk alone..Finds me here alone at the end of one more day..Does it matter that it wasn't your idea   God is a man   You know for certain   The knowledge in and of itself   Is more than we deserve      So you've tried   And you've made up your mind   Something's still not right   The devil you don't know is still outside.But please, don't change on hair for me, not if you care for me..I have tried to forget about you..And that means you, baw! '.He remembers the first time he met her he remembers the first thing she said   He remembers the first time he held her and the night that she came to his bed   He remembers her sweet day of saying honey has something gone wrong   He remembers the fun and the teasin' and the reason he wrote her this song   I'll give you a daisy a day dear I'll give you a daisy a day   I'll love you until the rivers run still and the four winds we know blow away   They would walk down the street in the evening and for years I would see them go by   And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore   Could be seen in the gleam in their eyes   As a kid they would take me for candy and I'd love to go tagging along   We'd hold hands while we walked to the corner   And the old man would sing her his song   I'll give you a daisy...   [ fiddle ]   Now he walks down the street in the evening and he stops by the old candy store   And I somehow believe he's believing he's holding her hand like before   For he feels all her love walking with him and he smiles at the things she might say   Then the old man walks up to the hilltop and he gives her a daisy a day   I'll give you a daisy....Get back   Yeah      Sweet Loretta Modern   thought she was a woman,   But she was another man..If you ask you can I kiss you   Say what will my pretty miss do?.Now, are why'all ready?.And do those feet in modern times   Walk upon the flowers   And walk upon their brothers   While their heads are busy lying low   Trying to keep to cover...oh      Something went wrong   Along the way   Everybody's waiting for   Judgment day      So they can go   Told you so      Bring me my gun of itching desire   Bring me my bullets and I will fire   Sights set higher than the tall church spire      Standing in line   The blind lead the blind   Waiting and waiting   For an overdue sign   Brothers and sisters   Playing Chinese whispers   If things aren't suited   Then they'll get diluted      There's one more dead with a hole in his head   He shouldn't have said all the things he said   Many tears were shed for the blood he bled.Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll..I love you now, do you love me still?.Tell my ma when I go home,   The boys won't leave the girls alone,   They pulled my hair and stole my comb,   But that's all right 'till I go home..Bring out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry..But now, a, now, now, now, I'm the sad and lonely one..I got an out of town pistol with the graveyard frame..I'm in a hole since I lost my baby,   Living in a hole since I lost my girl..Now he's gone and we're through, am I blue, am I blue?"
"Dear newspaper, Some people say that computers don't benefit society. But I think diferent. Computers benefit society more than you would think. They help people learn and makes work much easier. They help prevent acidents, and the save lives. Computers help people learn and make work easier its a fact. You can type you can plan your sedual. You can make a presantation or check your email. All of those things make work easier. And there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Makeing work easyer or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computers abilitys. Computers can prevent acidents in anything that moves. For example cars millions on the road today and some can practily drive them selves. And that is all done with computers. Also planes, the only reason the piolot is there is in case something gose wrong. Same thing with trains. Furthermore @CAPS1 are completly computerized all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time. And that makes the world safer for every one. Finaly computers save lives, its completly true. In hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs and asist with surgery. In surgery computers help by only haveing to make a tiny insision and can be much more acurate than human sergons which save lives. Also computers can mak sure that a operating room is completly sterial which reduces risks of infection. As you can see computers benifit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easyer. They prevent acidents with which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go they are almost garenteed a survival. So what do you think about them now..I often fantasize   A beautiful affair,   A broken paradise   'cause you don't even care..2X   Baby I'm not alone   Only wanna get high.But there's somethin' 'bout the way you move,   Yeah it gets to me like a melody..I don't know   I don't know what's on your mind   I thought everything was fine   But it was my surprise      I don't know   I don't know what's going on   Something surely must be wrong   You're living secret lives      Living secret lives, secret lives   And I wonder where she goes to in the night   In secret lives      Wish I knew   Wish I knew where I fit in   Wish that I knew everything   About your secret lives      If it means   If it means that much to you   I don't want to stop the things you do   I don't need alibis      Living secret lives, secret lives   And I wonder where she goes to in the night   In secret lives      I don't care   I don't care what goes on there   So long as one day I can share   Share your secret lives      Living secret lives, secret lives   And I wonder where she goes to in the night   In secret lives      Living secret lives, secret lives   And I wonder where she goes to in the night   In

By: Regine Velasquez      My morning starts to shine   With teardrops in my eyes   And here I am alone starting to realize   That my days would be brighter   If I could learn to hide   The feeling that I have for you   Keeps hurting me inside      Then my days begin   With simple thoughts of you   Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you   Sharing dreams with each other   And making them come true   Holding one another, saying all ""I need is you""      But will you say that you love me   And show me that you care   Say when I need you   You will always be there   But if you go and leave me   This I swear is true   My love will always be with you      Now my nights would end   With just one wish, that's you   To hold me in the dark   And help me make it through   'Cause the pain that's inside me   Would simply melt away   If I had you here with me   And promise me you'd stay      But will you say that you love me   And show me that you care   Say when I need you   You will always be there   But if you go and leave me   This I swear is true   My love will always be with you   Ooh, ooh, ooo      Instrumental      But will you   But will you say that you love me   And show me that you care   Say when I need you   You will always be there   But if you go and leave me   This I swear is true   My love will always   My love will always   My love will always be with you      My love will always be with you.You'll be just fine (just fine, just fine)      I know that baby we would disagree constantly   On the basic things (we did, we did)   You thought that there was someone else, all along (no way, no way)   Baby I want to decide to stay right by your side   Baby, they know just what to say..Somewhere there's speaking   It's already coming in   Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind   You never could get it   Unless you were fed it   Now you're here and you don't know why      But under skinned knees and the skid marks   Past the places where you used to learn   You howl and listen   Listen and wait for the   Echoes of angels who won't return      [Chorus]   He's everything you want   He's everything you need   He's everything inside of you   That you wish you could be   He says all the right things   At exactly the right time   But he means nothing to you   And you don't know why      You're waiting for someone   To put you together   You're waiting for someone to push you away   There's always another wound to discover   There's always something more you wish he'd say      [Chorus]      But you'll just sit tight   And watch it unwind   It's only what you're asking for   And you'll be just fine   With all of your time   It's only what you're waiting for      Out of the island   Into the highway   Past the places where you might have turned   You never did notice   But you still hide away   The anger of angels who won't return      [Chorus]      I am everything you want   I am everything you need   I am everything inside of you   That you wish you could be   I say all the right things   At exactly the right time   But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why   And I don't know why   Why   I don't know.You tell me your friends are distant   You tell my your man's untrue   You tell me that you've been walked on   And how you feel abused      So you stand here an angry young woman   Taking all the pain to heart   I hear you saying you want to see changes   But you don't know how to start      Love will find a way (How do you know)   Love will find a way (How can you see)   I know it's hard to see the past and still believe   Love is gonna find a way   I know that   Love will find a way (A way to go)   Love can make a way (Only love can know)   Leave behind the doubt   Love's the only out   Love will surely find a way      I know this life is a strange thing   I can't answer all the whys   Tragedy always finds me   Taken again by surprise      I could stand here an angry young woman   Taking all the pain to heart   But I know that love can bring changes   And so we've got to move on      If our God His Son not sparing   Came to rescue you   Is there any circumstance   That He can't see you through.Pleasure without love?.We need a little less taking, a whole lot more giving..Isn't it time to stop somehow?.Now they're spread out on the surface   Where we can try to congregate   It's not

Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried   Still I look to find a reason to believe      Someone like you makes it hard to live without   Somebody else   Someone like you makes it easy to give   Never think about myself      If I gave you time to change my mind   I'd find a way just to leave the past behind   Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried   Still I look to find a reason to believe      If I listened long enough to you   I'd find a way to believe that it's all true   Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried   Still I look to find a reason to believe

  If you'd only put me back to back with that girl   When the night's inviting   With just a little lighting   There'll never be days like that again   When I was just a boy and men were men   You never go from moment to moment   You're the living double of a single fiction   You're very colourful with your compliments   As you feel the finger's friction   It's a freeze-frame   Still it's real life   You don't want to look   Cause you've seen the film and you've read the book   I was looking at the black and white world   Trying to name some pin-up   Those days she was just a beautiful girl   Now she's framed and hung up   I thought she was young   Up until I saw her last night in close detail   Though they all fade away when you're so pale   It's more than just a physical attraction   It starts with a face and ends up a fixation   But you're never gonna feel a fraction   Of the way it used to work on your imagination   When you were looking at the black and white world..."

"You've got mail! @CAPS1 my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to! It is evident, that computers are effective, and are advancing technology in our society..Sometimes late at night   I sit beside our bed   Watching you sleeping so sweetly   I'm almost completely out

admiration   I'll sing it to the night   I'll sing until the light   Undying admiration      And when the morning comes   And a little child appears   Hearing the love in your laughter   Sometimes I just have to hold back the tears      The passion on your face   The depth of your soul   Would inspire any muse to lose control   There's no one in this whole world   That teaches me the way that you do      Undying admiration   Undying admiration   I'll write it on the sky   And tell the world of my   Undying admiration      All my life I've waited for   The kind of love   Keats and Shelley would be jealous of   And it's you baby   You made it all come true baby   Oh, oh      Undying admiration   Undying admiration   I'll write it on the sky   And tell the world of my   Undying admiration.Oh

"Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, @CAPS2 computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real-life. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be playing. a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me "" @CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?"" and i answer ""@CAPS2 i have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3."" @CAPS4, the computer takes time away from nature. People dont acknowledge the beauty of the outdoor. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more than @CAPS2 it helps us to appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet computer take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real-life. Some people dont know how to have a face-to-face conversation, they only know how to communicate by email or @CAPS5. I acknoowledge that getting away from real life can be relaxing but some people dont know which side the stomp goes on a letter. It @MONTH1 old-fashioned, but i believe people put their heart something you can't do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real-life, nature and your hobbies.

a night of our own   A thing to remember when we're all alone   So dance, it's our way to say goodbye      Yes, all we have to do is   Dance while the music still goes on   This is no time for crying   Dance, don't you hear them play our song   God knows that we've been trying   But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same   We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame   So dance while the music still goes on   And let it be our last goodbye      Yet it seems to make me sad..Would you love me tomorrow   Like you say you love me now   Would you love me, would you love me tomorrow   Like you say you love me now   When the flames of our flesh have stopped burning      And the fire of our love has cooled down   Too many times I've given too much   Baby, give me your love to me in return   Too many times I've given too much      Baby, give me your love in return   Give me your mind and your heart   But please don't leave me with a love that burns   And don't use me as your fool      'Cause my heart can't stand another lie   Please don't use me, don't use me as your fool   Baby, 'cause my heart can't stand another lie   And if you can't love me tomorrow   Please leave me now in my room to cry.And if you would let them hold you,   Oh how grateful I will be..So where you want to go today?.If we have to wait forever, that's alright   If you say, ""Let's run away,"" we'll leave

face again   The love that you have shown is unlike anything I've known   We both know it's just a matter of when      I wish that we could just turn back the hands of time   And find a way to have your world fit into mine   I'll keep dreaming that someday it all comes true   Girl, the reason my heart's breaking is for you and you alone      Oh, you and you alone are with me from now on   Even

"About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature..Chorus:   What makes us do the things we do heaven only knows..When I see my life flashing before me sometimes in these songs..Take a stand !.Why don't you come home to me?.Out upon the stage, crowd is going wild,   Love to see them women, babe   I ain't in denial..I got a 007 watch and it's a one and only   It's got a I-Spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely   I got a Batmobile so I can reach ya' in a fast shake   When your world's in crisis of an impendin' heartbreak      Now don't you call James Bond or Secret Agent Man   'Cause they can't do it, like I can   I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker -

"Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you @MONTH1 not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or laptop is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the @CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a @CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society..Channeled in my groove, part of another space and time..Have you heard this one?.well, she aint never lie,   I can

Until I hear your voice   I'm gonna lose my mind      Someone tell me why   I chose this life   This superficial lie   Constant compromise   Endless sacrifice      Moments wasted   Isolated   Time escaping   Endless sacrifice      Moments wasted   Isolated   Time escaping   Endless sacrifice      Over the distance   We try to make sense   Of surviving together   While living apart      Striving

"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 move to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to..You can't by stand all the people   Stand them on their own   They will fall to pieces   So we watch them grow   Into strange and pretty faces   I don't know   Clutching to my lipstick traces   Watch them go      Make mistake number three [Repeat: x3]      It's strange how much it changes   How they want to know   How cynical are people   That's where children go      Dragged into a conversation   They can't hold   It's so bad   But it prepares them for the mold      Make mistake number three   (repeat three times)      Why is my love like an ocean run dry?.Rampart Street   You can't be sure of a thing      When I get tired of restin'   There's nothing to do but walk, walk it off pop   And when I don't care to listen   There's nothing to do but talk, keep you big mouth shut      When I'm up in the airplane   There's nothing to do but fly   Life is so peculiar   But I often wonder why      Oh, life, is so peculiar, sure it is   A fork belongs with a knife, you know   Corn beef is lost without cabbage, leftover cabbage?...My heart was leaping in the sun   My friends all say that you're the one   Let me get this one thing very clear   There ain't enough going on down here      Mainline Florida, oh say   Mainline Florida, O.K..Celebrating   (Twistin' with Linda)   Oohhh, I keep on celebrating   (Twistin' with Linda)   Hey hey, hey hey   (Hey hey, hey hey)   Hey hey, hey hey hey   (Hey hey, hey hey hey)      [Fade].Je ne la verrai plus..We've got to hold on, got to hold on..Hey!.I'm a juvenile product of the working class, who's best friend floats in the bottom of a glass..When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?.With american flags on,   Each little finger..Take your pick and your shovel and the bold dynamite   For to shift a few tons of this earthly delight   Yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight..Hit the road out of nowhere, I had to jump my car   and be a rider in the love game following the stars..You kept me in the dark,   But now I finally see some daylight..But I'm just trying to find what you're hiding in that skirt   And cole got her coming out he might have been her first   So she only fuck with him like a choir in the church, good god   Mama told me get a good job   Be a doctor or a lawyer if you...

"Almost everyone is effected by computers in some sort of way. Some people think computers are bad because some people spend too much time on their computers. The thing is computers help us with our everyday life. If we want to comunicate with people from around the world to send donations to places in need like @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1, we can use computers to do that. We can chang people's lifes in third world countries with the help of computers. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online. Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that the users fault not ours. We should choose how long were using one computers. Many jobs would be impossible with out computers. It's not about overusing them its about. So over all I say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands..You ask too much of me   You try my patience   Your tongue, it's like a razor   You choose your words like weapons

"Many people like computer and like to use them for many different kinds of reason. Some people use them to get online education. Other use them to talk to family and friends that are far away. Also student use them to do research for school. These are reason why computer could be a good devices. There are many people that now have the ability to get a online education because of problem that they have. For example people that can't walk and don't like going to regular school. The computer would help them find website that they could get a free education. The computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher. The computer would make it so easy and better for the people that don't have the ability to walk they can even study for test that they have on the computer. This one reason why many people use computer. Many family use computer to try to look for freind that they haven't seen in a long time or family that are far away. They even contact them by chatting threw websites. They also search for addressed and phone number. Many people get to find there family threw internets. They meet in spot are even come to one another hauses. The computer would allow their dreams to happen by finding their familys. This would be an exciting event for them this why they need computer. This is one very important reason student use computer to research projects. Without computer student won't be able to look for information they need to know. The computer would teach student about people in the past they didn't know or didn't got to meet. The computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history. Children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher. These are some reason why I think we all need computer. We need them for people that don't have the ability to walk, for people that have family and friend far away, and for student that would like to learn more. These are all things people enjoy doing on a computer. If there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future. So this are some reason why many people decide to be on computer..Could'ya, for big red apple?.Now   There is light coming in   Through the crack in the door      Now   There is hope   Where i' d never expect it before      Now   There are so many things   But there' s nothing at all      Now   You are learning to stand   I am learning to fall..So today has got to be a good day,   Today is gonna be a good day,   Today is gonna be a good day,   Good day, good day, good day..It's dark as hell here   This city's gown cold   The devil's in drag   Playing poker with souls   The lots are all empty   The last man's out   The moon's made of cheese   And God is a boy scout   When I go to sleep   I'll be dreaming about   All the things...

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have heard that people are thinking of how computers are having a bad effect on people and I disagree. Computers help people so much in schools, work places, and at home. Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers. For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays, letters and so many other writing pieces, and the same goes for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students use computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some @ORGANIZATION1 even more. For example my @CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters. She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can't read it she can't grade it. I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write the things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose, soon hand writing will no longer ne required. Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs, for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could ""take control"" of people and people would spend to much time on them. But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time, keeping computers would benefit in so many ways.

"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers have a posotive effect on people. There is many ways computers can have posotive effects on humans, first computers bring people together and let people interact with each other, They let people talk to each other. Computers also let people learn about new things. The internet has so much information. Computers also let people do things that they can't do with out computers. So computers have a positive effect on people. Computers let people interact with each other. The computers bring people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it. But with email they would get it the second you send it. There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people. When you and you freind cant talk together you just have to get on you computer. Computers also have web camera, those let people talk to echother. and you can see them. It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone thats why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet. If you someone else they might not know the answer. Computer let people see pictures and videos. If you wanted to see a picture of @CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Vidios let you watch things like something funny to cheer up you day. If you love a show on to, and you missed it you can find it on computer. That is why computer benifit people positively. Computers also let you do things that you couldn't do without. When a teacher asks me to type a paper I always do it on the computer. If there were no computers I would have to use a typewriter and if I made a mistake I would have to type the whole thing again. Computers also alow you to play music. On the computer you can put a cd in and it will play the music. Computers alow you to do things that couldnt do without Computers benifit society an have a positive effect on people, They let people interact with each other and they bring people together. They let people talk to each other. Computers also let you learn about newthings. They also let you do things that you couldnt do without. Computers have many positive effects on people so I hope you agree that computers benifit soctity.If you can't finish don't start hey   If you can't finish don't start hey   If you can't finish don't start hey      [Chorus:].Elements that I'm among, these none..You want it, you want it, you know you really want it!.(kalan)   What If you gave me a   Second chance..Oh      Oh yeah!.All over town they're talking about me   The whole world knows you're happy without me   You've broken my heart, So what do I care?.Your kingdom generation   Declares Your majesty   Our lives are resounding with Your praise      We see Your spirit moving   We burn with holy fire   Your glory is seen through all the earth      You set eternity in my heart   So I'll live for You   Hallelujah, hallelujah   Honor and praise forever   We'll shout a victory cry   From here to eternity      Hallelijah, hallelujah   We'll take our place in history   We'll shout Your awesome love   From here to eternity.I didn't brush my hair   And my lashes are falling   Off of seven years   Of our bad luck dating..Yes, faith can move mountains   Darling, you will see   I can move mountains   If you have faith in me      Yes, I can move mountains   If you have faith in me.(This one's goin' out to the strip joints   Yo, meet me at Suzy's Rendez-vous   For every Go-Go Bar   I'ma send this one out to the gentlemen's clubs   Magic City, New York dogs, Rolex   I be seeing y'all up in there late at night   I understand when your girl is stressing you out   (Crazy girls) Know what I'm saying?.In these mad dog days   I call them mad dog days   I know them mad dog days   I don't care if it's true   Between me and you   Can't see it through   Oh please, let me say goodbye..I got no reason to be there, but I   Imagine it would be some kind of change..a man!.Excuse me for this   I just want a kiss   I just want to know what it feels like to touch   Something so pure   Something I'm so sure of   What it feels like to stand outside your door   I'm unworthy   I can see you're above me   But I can be lovely given the chance      Don't move   I want to remember you just like this   Don't move   It's only a breath or two between our lips      [Chorus:]   I know why you left   I can't blame you myself   Must be hard living with ghosts and such an empty shell   I tried to warn you   I've been a mess since you've known me   I can't promise forever   But I'm working on it   If I can't hold you   Can I give you a kiss      Can I have a kiss      I see that you're torn   I've got some scars of my own   Seems I want what I know is gonna leave me hungry      Don't move   I need to remember you just like this      [Chorus]      Can I      All I have   All I can give to you I will   Just promise this   If I can't have forever   Can I have a kiss, kiss, kiss   No      [Chorus]      Can I give you a kiss   Can I, can I   Can I have a kiss.I know it's over - still I cling   I don't know where else I can go   Oh...

"Dear local newspaper I disagree because people should just enjoying spending time with famimely and not on the computer  doing nothing do you agree with me so far? Frist of being if you wast all you're time being of the computer there is nothing there is nothing you can get done as I have notice many shildren are on computer every right after school playing on the computer. For example my cosiun is on the computer evryday doing  but wasting his time are you still with me. Secondly children should be studying on the computer not playing video games and going in website that are not allowed more then @NUM1 do students and children are on the internet palying video games and doing something the is done everyday also I have seen many kids playing games on the computer. Thirdly student will never learn nothing if they wast there time because computer is for studing and many students don't have there time wisely as they should also many student should be useing comput only sometimes not everyday I have notice that so many students don't learn from compu for because they are not studing tests mre then @PERCENT1 stundent fail classes because of computer. First of people should be spending time with  and friends because they are teh most important people aroun ud not computers. Are still with me? Secondly friends are the most important people I ever had because they care about and love you like you're ther families but what if you just wast youre on computer how are you know all your friends. For example m allways on comput never goes to see her friemds amd her friends to to here because she never cares about their only computer do god get what im saying here. Thirdly family is also important then just being on the computer because they care about you have to at lease spend sometime with family for example many families stop spending time with each othe because computer is important to them. Lastly help you're community is goal because you make you\re city look you don't want it he be massy also many people quit help with commicity servic around the neighbor for example I have see  trash on grounds and because they dont care. Finally going out doing sports and starting fit is very important. First of playing sports is far and youve health but people never play sports anymore just because computer for example @NUM2 people stop playing sports, secondly going to is very import because is good..I know I know where should I go,   a nice lil' mirror and a little white girl   Way at the top of the mountain, bouncing..Some more onion rings.Starting today, starting today   I know that I'm the one to blame, you say every man's the same   But watch how quick I change my ways...My love belongs to who.He's so charming and sweet and likeable!.Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out   My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there ain't no doubt   But one things for certain   When it comes my time   I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind..Life isn't easy   So why don't you stay   With the lover you need   And not the devil you pay?.I probably would have kept on guessing   But about that time we crashed into the truck   And as I'm laying bleeding there on the asphalt   Finally I recognize the face of my hibachi dealer   Who takes off his prosthetic lips and tells me   Everything you know is wrong   Black is white, up is down and short is long   And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter   Everything you know is wrong   Just forget the words and sing along   All you need to understand is   Everything you know is wrong      I was walkin' to the kitchen for some Golden Grahams   When I accidentally stepped into a alternate dimension   And soon I was abducted by some aliens from space   Who kinda looked like Jamie Farr   They sucked out my internal organs   And they took some Polaroids and said I was a darn good sport   And as a way of saying thank you   They offered to transport me back to any point in history that I would care to go   And so I had them send me back to last Thursday night   So I could pay my phone bill on time   Just then the disembodied head of Colonel Sanders started yelling      Everything you know is wrong   Black is white, up is down and short is long   And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter   Everything you know is wrong   Just forget the words and sing along   All you need to understand is   Everything you know is wrong      I was just about to mail a letter to my evil twin   When I got a nasty paper cut   And, well, to make a long story short   It got infected and I died   So now I'm up in heaven with St. Peter by the pearly gates   And it's obvious he doesn't like the Nehru jacket that I'm wearing   He tells me that they've got a dress code   Well, he lets me into heaven anyway   But I get the room next to the noisy ice machine for all eternity   And every day he runs by screaming      Everything you know is wrong   Black is white, up is down and short is long   And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter   Everything you know is wrong   Just forget the words and sing along   All you need to understand is   Everything you know is wrong.This is your last chance, yeah   This is your last chance, right   This is your last chance   Yeah!.I spent a lot of time looking for me in your eyes   I spent a lot of nights sleeping on the end of our bed   Then I realize that this time, time won't tell   People like myself can't compromise this well      And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,   Won't let go so easily....Ever felt away with me   Just once that all I need   Entwined in finding you one day   Ever felt away without me   My love, it lies so deep   Ever dream of me      Would you do it with me   Heal the scars and change the stars   Would you do it for me   Turn loose the heaven within      I'd take you away   Castaway on a lonely day   Bosom for a teary cheek   My song can but borrow your grace      Ever felt away      Come out, come out wherever you are   So lost in your sea   Give in, give in for my touch   For my taste for my lust      Ever felt away      Your beauty cascaded on me   In this white night fantasy      Ever felt away.(honest john plain)   If I'd known then what I know now   I'd do it all again 'cause I'm crazy and how   About my mixed-up, messed-up pretty little psycho girl   I should've given her a swift body swerve   I didn't so I got what I deserve   A freaked-out, spaced-out crazy little psycho girl   Psycho girl - look what you're doing   How come you have to be this way?.Just dance?.Everyone would have a friend,   And right would always win,   And love would never end:   This is my grown-up Christmas list,   This is my only lifelong wish,   This is my grown-up Christmas list!.You can get the money!.Like bubbas girl   I want I want Bubba's girl   Why can't I find a cousin like that!.You're born to quit!.She said she comes from ice land....You May not like my appearance..[Ja Rule]   Love what your body does to me   On me, asking me, off that ecstasy   Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak   Fuck then fall asleep, locking for a week   Now we barely even talk and walk the block   Kiss and cuddle up, girl we losing touch   What's a man to do but go crazy babe?.Alright now, face, come out and bore me!"
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable..Keep me steady   Don't rock me all around   Lord, I don't wanna fall down   Understand me   I wish this jet was off the ground   Look around you   And tell me what you see   Are you afraid or is it me?.California sunset   Going down in the West   All the colors in the sky   Kiss another day goodbye..I'm thinkin' what to write in my M-B-enz (Mercedes Bendz)   How my disc gonna end?.The street is like a jungle!.Help me through this,   Pleaseee!.Leaders fall, leaders rise   Terror wears a thin disguise   Not much room for compromise   Around the world..Yeah, but still I rock around too pride,   Ladies mad at me cause I fuck too loud!.I beleive it has me under a spell , a spell that will soon take   Me to hell..In a dog's life   A year is really more like seven   And all too soon a canine   Will be chasing cars in doggie heaven      It seems to me   As we make our own few circles 'round the sun   We get it backwards   And our seven years go by like one      Dog years...It's the season of the itch   Dog years...With every scratch it reappears      In the dog days   People look to Sirius   Dogs cry for the moon   But these connections are mysterious      It seems to me   While it's true that every dog will have his day   When all the bones are buried   There is barely time to go outside and play      Dog years...It's the season of the itch   Dog years...With every scratch it reappears   Dog years...For every sad son of a bitch   Dog years...With his tail between his ears      I'd rather be a tortoise from Galapagos   Or a span of geological time   Than be living in these dog years      In a dog's brain   A constant buzz of low-level static   One sniff at the hydrant   And the answer is automatic      It seems to me   As well make our own few circles 'round the block   We've lost our senses   For the higher-level static of talk.Inside I hide      But I'd never mind...

"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I, for one do not. I think a decent amount of time on the computer, you can benefit from. But I do belive that computers are a huge part of peoples lives now. I think that people should get off the computer, and get some exercise more and more people would be so much healthier, if they took the time they were on the computer and exercised instead. On the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places, nature, and even people. But if people got off the computers and traveled and enjoyed nature, they would be able to live it, not just see a picture. Everything would be so much more fun if you were there and got to experience it, not just read about it. Another reason why I feel so strongly about people spending less time on computers is because they don't spent much time interacting with family and friends when you are the computer to much it seems like you drift away from you friends and family. Almost as if you are to ""busy"" to see them. So as you can see I highly disagree with the overuse of computers..So God imparts to human hearts,   The blessings of His heaven..No life till leather   We are gonna kick some ass tonight   We got the

heartache song   You treat me fine and you wined and dined   And I believed you when you said   I love you babe, but your only aim   Was to get me in your bed   Now I don't even like you no more   But I can't get you off of my mind   Baby youve got me livin in   Heartache central time   Heartache central   Heartache central   Heartache central time      Anytime is a hurting time   With a hurting

afraid to lose   But when you say that it's right   That it's here tonight   I'm ready to see it, too   Like a prisoner's release   Like a promise of peace   I want to believe it's true   I want to believe it's you"
"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a very positive effect on people. @CAPS13 reasons are that they can educate @CAPS1, they make things easy, they are enjoyable. Below, I will explain each reason. Firstly, its very educational. Computer are like a giant resource of information. Many teachers @MONTH1 direct their students online @CAPS2 learning purposes. Also, alot of people go online to research information @CAPS2 their school, job, or a project. Great websites that are packed with information, like @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed using a computer. @CAPS2 example imagine having to do your research using only books, but you live far @CAPS6 a library. The internet makes that research very easy, as you access to @CAPS7 any time! Secondly, they make things very easy to do. Computer provide people with many easy, convieniant ways to do many tasks. If there werent any computers in the world. don't you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging? Almost all of the @CAPS4/@CAPS5 in the @LOCATION2 like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them In buy things online, which is way more easy than going by car. I remember a time when I wanted to by something @CAPS6 a store all the way in @LOCATION1 I went online at home and bought @CAPS7 there! Also, @CAPS7 makes things like ordering @CAPS8, getting plane tickets, getting help alot much easier & @CAPS7 saves time! Thirdly, computers are very enjoyable! They provide alot of @CAPS17 things to do! @CAPS2 example if you are bored you can get on computer, & search @CAPS2 a game you enjoy. There is always a game you'll like. On of all of that, you enjoy @CAPS7 by talking to your friends and Family. You stay in touch, while enjoying their company. Another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another, lightining @CAPS10 because of email. Imagine that you don't have a phone, and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip, that you son is very sic. If you send @CAPS7 by mail, @CAPS7 take at least @NUM1 days. By email, only a couple minutes so, you can see that computer also can provide some @CAPS11 of safety @CAPS2 everybody! So, as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @CAPS13 ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @CAPS1 learn. They make things like ordering @CAPS8, getting tickets, or contacting helpl very easy @CAPS15, they are very enjoyable, @CAPS6 playing @CAPS17 games, to staying in touch with your Friends and Family. Don't you think that without computers we'd probably suffer? I think computers have a great effect on people.Over the rooftops and houses,   Lost as it tries to be seen,   Fields of incentive covered with green..Know every station off by heart..It's just another story 'bout going too far,   It's just another story 'bout going too far..We were made for each other   As the stars were made for the sky..I know so many who would want to see your Burn..Our crooked delegation   Wants a donation   To send the preacher to the holy land   Hey hey lord honey don't give your money   To that lying, cheating man..

"To: The @ORGANIZATION1 can be a big part mof people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth grade teachers once said, ""@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big french paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!"" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers! .Baby..(You do, baby)   Baby don't talk about it, let's be about it, 'cause I do   (Baby, I do)   Your other girl won't let you do it

"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves '@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!.He was just a carpenter by trade   He learned from his father at a very early age   There was something special in the man   There was much more to his life   Than just working with his hands   And He'd say   ""There's no home I could design   That would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind   If you only took the time""      [Chorus:]   Love your neighbor like your brother   Treat your brother like a friend   Always turn the other cheek   Help the weary and the weak   Make the time for young and old   And as your life unfolds   Each kindness that you've shown   Will be the nails and hammers   As you build your final ladder   In the manner of the carpenter of old      You could feel compassion in his eyes   Only fools that hurt him did not realize   That he was speaking to us all   The righteous and the mighty   The silent and the small   And He'd say ""   There's no home I could design   That would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind   If you'd only take the time""      [Chorus:]      He was just a carpenter by trade   He learned from his father at a very early age.And Boy - You're gonna get burned Queen of Arts!.This song is also dedicated to all the kids living in this society   Who are being deprived of their basis rights,   The right to a peaceful home,   The right to an education,   The right to innocence,   The right to health and food,   To love and to be loved,   The right to a joyful youth..No matter what you do, no matter where you go   You've got to have an ace in the hole..You are my special girl..""I can't reach you on the telephone..I'm a one woman man, home lovin' type   All complete with slippers and pipe   Take me like I am er leave me be!.Rules are made to be broken,   Can't kill what you don't understand..Eyes are closed and death is calling   Reaching out its hand   Call upon the starlight to surround you      Out of the Shadow and into the sun   Dreams of the past as the old ways are done   Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain   But we must endure it to live again      [Chorus x3]      A man who casts no shadow has no soul.Five gears in reverse   For girls looking at the big lift   Somebody send out for the night nurse   Please don't stick me on the late shift   If you don't know by now   Nobodys gonna tell you   If you don't know by now   The shock will probably kill you      But if your patience is corrupted and you still cannot decide   Youre sitting in the garage contemplating suicide   And you have no motivation you can't even catch your breath   All of this acceleration is driving you to death      Five gears in reverse   You think I don't know what I'm doing   Another fashionable first   Like walking down the road to ruin   But if you're safe and sound   Don't let me interrupt you   And if you're gagged and bound   Well how can I corrupt you      Chorus.You be good to me, i'll be good to you   Anything you want, anything you do   I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you   Give it all I got, and to keep it hot      Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?.We got to put that shit together in a creative style..Cause your my fire...   You take me higher....I know that you   Don't know me very well   We've barely met   But I can surely tell   No one will ever   Love you like I do   I like to feel   The warm spot on your chair   Sometimes I drool   And usually I stare   My precious one   I saved that gum   That you threw in the garbage   You're the one I dream about   But the only question with me now   Is ""Do I creep you out?"".You're on your way, Runaway Child, Running Wild,   Runaway Child Running Wild,   Better go back home where you belong..[Chorus]      So hard to fall... in love   This doesn't have to be... love   (Love, love is all I feel... your love is what I fear)   Love me... love me   So hard to fall   So very hard to fall..What's so bad about feeling good?.They won't leave me alone   (Do you remember all those tears?).And you'll never hear their voices   And you'll never see their faces   You have no recourse to the law anymore..Sweat!.I'm all alone   S.O.L.O."
"Most adults beileve that computers are just awaist of time and are somtimes can be addicting or bad for health. Well its true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socilizing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer, and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town. There is another @CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of. People you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing. There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actuall important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy. Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework. Its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school. How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather people always want to know breaking news. Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting. There is one more topic that I know youre going to absoltly love. I mean right now your grading this in your office, well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl. People work from home all the time. you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns company and works from home most days. Its absoutly @CAPS1 be is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying its only a click away here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there, well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple keys and boom, your on your way to see your information. That was faster then two hours i'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future. So the next time you log on to your comptuer do some of these things and turst me your will think exactly what I think..Dark meditation,   Your second sight can show my light   In a crystal ball..But halitosis, is all you're rockin' steady..But you're pushing me,   Shoving me..Connie had another drink, Jimmy simply couldn't think,   Billy G. was passed out underneath the sink..was it something that I've already missed?.Well had I known or I'd been shown back   When I longed you'd take me..How many times   Do we weather out the stormy evenings   Long to slam the front door   Drive away into the setting sun?.When I came back again, my car was gone..You know, man, you ain't doin' it right..I'm searching for you   I wanna know, where did you go?.Lord, we have seen the rising sun, awakening the early dawn   And we're rising up to give You praise   Lord, we have seen the stars and moon, see how they shine   They shine for You and You're calling us to do the same   So we rise up with a song   And we rise up with a cry   And we're giving You our lives   We will shine like stars in the universe   Holding out Your truth in the darkest place   We'll be living for Your glory   Jesus we'll be living for Your glory   Lord, we have seen the rising sun, awakening the early dawn   And we're rising up to give You praise   Lord, we have seen the stars and moon, see how they shine   They shine for You and You're calling us to do the same   So we rise up with a song   And we rise up with a cry   And we're giving You our lives   We will shine like stars in the universe   Holding out Your truth in the darkest place   We'll be living for Your glory   Jesus we'll be living for Your glory, oh   We will burn so bright with Your praise O God   And declare Your light to this broken world   We'll be living for Your glory   Jesus we'll be living for Your glory   Like the sun so radiantly, sending light for all to see   Let Your holy church arise   Exploding into life like a Supernova's light   Set Your holy church on fire   Like the sun so radiantly, sending light for all to see   Let Your holy church arise   Exploding into life like a Supernova's light   Set Your holy church on fire, we will shine, yeah, we will shine   We will shine like stars in the universe   Holding out Your truth in the darkest place   We'll be living for Your glory   All our days Jesus we'll be living for Your glory, oh   We will burn so bright with Your praise O God   And declare Your light to this broken world   We'll be living for Your glory   Jesus we'll be living for Your glory, oh   So we rise up with a song   And we rise up with a cry   And we're giving You our lives   Jesus we'll shine.Laugh now motherfucker...

"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exersize any more because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good..Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!.watch the sun go down..Somebody, please, if somebody will   Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille   Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing   Her still   I think about her constantly   Somebody, please, if somebody can   Let them take a letter from this   Lonely man   All I ask is Lord, make her understand   I'll die if she don't wait for me   I heard a rumor from the guys in Cell A   You've served your time and you are   Leaving today   Well, there is something you can do   For me to help

Understand because   I'll die if she don't wait for me   Oooooh, somebody, please, if somebody will   Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille   Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing   Her still

"Dear newspaper, People are spending to much time on their computers. They are on the computers when they should be exercising. People need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends. Let me explain more. Firstly, the people who are consently @CAPS1 people, facebooking people, or on myspace aren't getting exercise. Now, more than ever people are becoming very obese. It is very unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and becoming overweight. Eight out of ten @CAPS2 aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers, they don't sit back, relay and take in nature. People don't get that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinced they are not comming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone. Computers are the wall between inside and going outside in back at the world. Finaly, the computers are getting in the way of seeing family and friends. Everyone is so caught up in the newist computer they don't see their friends or family I know some people who when its time for dinner, they walk down to the kitchen. Get their food and bring if to their computer so they don't miss out on anthing family and friends are very important. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 onley see friends and family on holidays. Computers are getting in the way of everything! People arent getting the exercise they need. They aren't going outside to enjoy the nature and the arent seeing there friends and family. We need to get people off their butts and away from the computer. Why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway?.Come all you rounders if you want to hear the story about a brave engineer   Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame   Caller called Casey bout half past four he kissed his wife at the station door   He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand      Said this is the trip to the Promised Land   Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand   Casey Jones leanin' out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land      Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a fallin' and the water was high   Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones   Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we ain't a givin' up yet   We're eight hours late with the southbound mail   We'll be on time or we're leavin' the rails   Casey Jones climbed in the cabin...

"Dear @CAPS1, In my opinion I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people @MONTH1 have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer. For example, @CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what. Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. When I say this I mean like @CAPS2 you have a computer connect with them on the computer. For example like @CAPS2 you have a gmail, facebook, yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there. I do it all the time. Last reason why I that we should use computer is because sometimes @MONTH1 have to go on the for example @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 had important message the website and you message you. I do it why can't you. So yes I do their..Oh I can't control myself!.Two-forty for his speed   Then hitch 'em to an open sleigh,   An' crack you'll take the lead!.Hear me now, now..I'ma kill her ass when a nigga make parole   Hit her with my cane, cause a nigga gray and old      [Chorus]      [Ice Cube]   Man, it ain't right man   You know y'all ain't doin' me right man   A nigga tryin' to do right man   You know I'm tryin' to change my life man, you know?.Bluebells of scotland : to nat the cat, minnie and alec   O where tell me where has your heelin' laddie gone?.Instead of waking up to find   A nightmare of a different kind..Let me eat off his head so you can really see!.Caught in a fight   I was drawn again   I never thought I'd be betrayed   By my best friend   He lost his life as he went for mine   If this is the end   I want to die with you      Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me?.The last, the last guest..I'm back in the saddle again   I'm back!.Spin me round kiss me in your chevrolet..The only letter I deserve!.Please pour a little bit of wine, will ya pretty baby?.Envy of, a sense of true identity, a sign of confidence to see..You made me cry when you said good-bye..I've gotta get a train, take me back home again,   See my daddy, momma wants to see me too..And proceeded to light himself on fire   As he stood there glowing and said,   Remember this day..In his master's step he trod,   Where the snow lay dented..Lost in a dream in the arms of the night   Two lonely prisoners of our own device   Don't let me go..She not coming back to stay..Right here I'll stay   With a bullet in my back!"
"Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people..It seems as though time must betray us,   yet we're alive   and though I see no God to save us,   yetl we survive   through the centuries of progress   which don't get us very far..In the lane, snow is glistenin'   A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight   Walkin' in a winter wonderland      Gone away is a bluebird   Here to stay is a new bird   He sings a love song as we go along   Walkin' in a winter wonderland      In the meadow we can build a snowman   And pretend that he is Parson Brown   He'll say, ""Are you married?.Under the pale moon, where I see a lot of stars   Oo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo   Is enough enough?.There....No one to talk with   I'm by my self,   No one to walk with,   But I'm happy on the shelf   Aint misbehavin'   I'm savin' my love for you.....Lord I fell for her smile   And she loved me for a while   Then she said good-bye gotta go   Left me standing on the side of the road   Now she's gone and I'm a memory in her past   And the long and short of it some things never last      [Chorus]   Oh because summers come, summers go   I'll keep walking down this road   It's alright and it's okay   I'll live to love another day   I'll live to love another day      Lord I'm out here again   With my back to the wind   The warm sun that's sinking low   Is gonna leave me out in the cold   But the long and short of it some things never last   And if that goes for the good   It must go for the bad      [Chorus]      If I fall down   I'm not ashamed   I always get back up again   But I'll be fine 'till the right one comes to save me, save me, save me      Lord I fell for her smile   And she loved me for a while   And someday she's gonna wish   She hadn't left me here like this      [Chorus]      I'll live to love another day   I'll live to love another day   I'll live to love another day.[Chorus]      No more sorrow   I've paid for your mistakes   Your time is borrowed   Your time has come to be replaced!.That's why I always turn around..You are my brothers   Each one I would die for   Please just let it go   All our heads have blown   Let's take the stage   And remember what we play for      I can't take no more   What are we fighting for?.I lost ten points just for being in the right place   at exactly the wrong time   I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well have   been completely blind   So, if you see me walking all alone   Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home   there's a train leaves here this morning, and   I don't know, what I might be on   She signed me to a contract, baby said it would   all be so life long   I looked around then for a reason   when there wasn't something more to blame it on   But, if time makes a difference while we're gone   Tell me now, and I won't be hanging on   There's a train leaves here this morning   and I don't know, what I might be on   ooo, ooo, ooo.. etc...   1320 North Columbus was the address   that I wrote down on my sleeve   I don't know just what she wanted   might have been that it was getting time to leave   and I watched as the smoker passed it on   and I laughed when the joker said, ""Lead on."".Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist,   Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?.Nothing else can break my heart like   True love, true love,   It must be true love..Eia, eia, Susani, susani, susani..""No not really"" But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly   And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?.Well, gonna rock, gonna rock,   Gonna rock, yeh gonna rock..(dance) no!.Shadows will scream that I'm alone..Can you feel it?.I'm sorry but you come to the wrong house   But I know who those flowers are for   The flowers that you have are for   Someone who's happy   And happiness lives next door   Someone sends her flowers each evening   And her young heart is flooded with joy   So don't keep her waiting   Deliver her flowers to happiness   Who lives next door   The only one who would send flowers to you   Is gone to return no more   But there's some consolation to know   Someone is happy   And happiness lives next door   The only one who would send flowers to you   Is gone to return no more.It's the best part we've ever known   Step into the future, we'll hold on to      High School Musical   Let's celebrate where we come from   With friends who've been there all along   That's right      Now we finally realize who we are, it just took some time   We have to live and to learn to see the truth   (Learn to see the truth)   Nothing's ever impossible, into the future we all free fall   But forever we'll always have high school      Time to party now, celebrate   'Cause the world's one big stage   And any part you want, it can be yours   Everybody sing, yeah!.Is the reason why he left you in the end?"
"I think computers work @CAPS4 because it helps people with there own work. but computers do make people addicted because you mostly could do anything but mostly computers were able to use for help like work, maps, friend to find ot problems like for school it helps htem with math, science, social studies and @CAPS4 of more things. But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people. And computers do really break @CAPS4 because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. So you mostly spend about @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ as fix it. And there new computers come and its like @NUM3$ and @NUM4$ and there different just from beand and ther go aboutmore faster. And whne people's computer break some go crazy and feel like doing some cordy stuff. Ther does feel like they does friends they only stay at the room for every they never down out at all and if they do come out the room they instly dont respect there parents they do whatever they feel like doing and they they act into troubles with the . So computers do help out sometimes they dont but maybe should make different changes..The darkness came closer to home on the   Following night   And Miriam slept like a rock when   Jonathan's face went white      The bedroom was ice cold   But the fire was burning still   The blinding light   The family ghost had risen again...the ghost      Don't be scared, don't be scared now my friend   I am count de lafey   Let me take you to the crypt down below   Where Abigail rests      Let Miriam sleep   She never would understand   Now come let us go... it's time to know      Beware of the slippery stairs   You could easily fall and break your neck   Hand me that torch and I will lead the way   To the secret in the dark      Take a look into the vault, the vault   The sarcophagus...of a child   Abigail has been in here for years and years   Stillborn, born... born... born      The spirit of Abigail is inside your wife   And there's only one way you can stop   The rebirth of evil itself   You must take her life now.Took it away from me..Days can be sunny   With never a sigh   Don't need what money can buy   Birds in the trees sing   Their day full of song   Why shouldn't we sing along?.He sleeps with a chain saw   Got eyes like an outlaw   He takes a two smoke walk   He don't like to talk      And he don't like change   And he don't like change   You may think he's deranged   But he'd rather be home,   Home..

everything I've always wanted   But I can't believe she gives it all to me   Mmm, lips that warm my face with mornin' kisses   Arms that reach to hold me tenderly   And love that always satisfies completely   But I can't believe she gives it all to me   She gives me more than any one man deserves   I who have everything am nothing without her   Somehow she knows I need her desperately   I can't believe she gives it all to me.God save us all   God save us all   God save us all   If we really try   Maybe we can make it      We need a teacher   We must learn to see the light   Let's get

near   And forever keep you here   Forget all about whatever we fear   And let's just be lovers   Loving and loving, oh love is the way   To make me stay      I know the way to persuade me over to your side   And I am sure you can   So if you get me to believe   It all will work out fine   'Cause you'll blow my mind   So let's pick a place, a day, and a time   And then we'll be lovers   Loving and loving, oh love is the way   To make me stay.When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world   It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl   And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting   And it's all because she don't want things to change      [Chorus]   So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you   That's the wrong thing to do   Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you   That's the wrong thing to do   Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you   That's the wrong thing to do   Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying   And say I love you too      But I need someone different   You know it, oh ho, you know it   Oh ho, you know it, we both know it   I need someone different   You know it, oh ho, you know it   Oh ho,

not being in love, and not being together   But we sure make it feel like we're together   Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else      [Chorus]      But I need someone different   You know it, oh ho, you know it   Oh ho, you know it, we both know it   I need someone different   You know it, oh ho, you know it   Oh ho, you know it, we both know it   Something's been missing   You

have waited until September   Just a couple more memories to remember      I guess I had to pay you back to your lender   I guess I had to send you back to The Sender   But then again maybe you're gone till November   And maybe this is just a part of the agenda      Why'd you have to go so soon   We miss you      Why couldn't you come right home   When you seen the text message in your phone   I should've put my pradas on to come and find you   I could've told you that them niggs was behind you      I couldve told you all about my intuition   I couldve even brought the extra ammunition      But now you've m-m-m-moved so fuck you   Should've known from day one I couldn't trust you      Why'd you have to go so soon   We miss you      Why would they take you from me   Why the doctors could not stop the bleeding   If you in a better place then you free   Well then why can't they make me believe it      You said that you would leave these streets   And I know you didn't mean in a body bag   But now you see you not bullet proof   And I'm mad cause you the best that I ever had      Why'd you have to go so soon   We miss you      I'll never love again.Can you hear me?.I?ll take your side and I?ll take you into town   And there you'll search around   You hope she must be waiting now   Found what you need don't push her too far   Don't ever let her see you down   I hope she's waiting now   It?s not that she has been around   Too long to never try   Too long to never try   For every corner there's a way out   And every day that you lose   There's a pay out, there's a pay out   And if she cries you know it will be fine   With things now on your side don't frown   She is waiting now   But if she sings, then she's taken all you bring   To her you mean all things you smile   She's waiting now   It?s not that she has been around   Too long to never try   Too long to never try   For every corner there's a way out   And every day that you lose   There's a pay out, there's a pay out   But don't you think the time will come   When you'll get in her way   Or she?ll bring you down the same   For every corner there's a way out   And every day that you lose   There's a pay out   For every corner there's a way out   And every day that you lose   There's a pay out, there's a pay out   There's a pay out"
"Computers, computers, computers. Who doesn't own them right? They teach hand eye coordination, give people to learn about faraway places and people can you actually believe some people say otherwise? I think that's pure bull !@. Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step. Cellphones, cars, telephones want! There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em? By the press of the button, all doors unlocked, by a swith the windows go down, yes, by computer. Now, how do computer's make life easier you say? Well keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats the pencils you we are all made by, the yoou know what! Machines, but programed with computer chips. Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop! I hope now you believe computers do really benefit us. With there everday items we use, how they make work easier, and how it does make us interact. We use them everday, and hopefully they'll be around for the longest..You've come home!.Dwee da da da da da da da da, da da da da da,   Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do..I know what we had came from above..Big and fat   Pig's supposed to look like that   Barnyard thug   Sleeps on straw and calls it a rug   Yeah that's a rug, OK   He's walking down the street   And nobody's gonna argue with him   He's a half-a-ton of pig meat      Up in the hills above the farm   Lives a pack of wolves   Never did no harm   Sleep all day   Hunt till four   Maybe catch a couple of rodents   You know carnivore      Sheep in the meadow   Nibbling on some clover   One of the sheep wanders over   Sits by a rock   Separated from the flock   He's just sitting by a rock      Where'd he go?.Drop the biscuit (I will!).I wish Coke was still Cola   And a joint was a bad place to be   And it was back before Nixon lied to us all on tv      Before microwave ovens   When a girl still cooked [Incomprehensible] wood   Is the best of the free life behind us now   Are the good times really over for good?.Doesn't matter anyway   Did you know   Someone else has said the things?.March on!.Yeah, lose some sleep and say you tried..And they'll comfort you and they'll love you too - on the Night Shift..Our God is an awesome God..My comrade fighters   Been sent astray      How could I know   What others had in mind for me?.Disorder in the house   The tub runneth over   Plaster's falling down in pieces by the couch of pain      Disorder in the house   Time to duck and cover   Helicopters hover over rough terrain      Disorder in the house   Reptile wisdom   Zombies on the lawn staggering around      Disorder in the house   There's a flaw in the system   And the fly in the ointment's gonna bring the whole thing down      The floodgates are open   We've let the demons loose   The big guns have spoken   And we've fallen for the ruse      Disorder in the house   It's a fate worse than fame   Even the Lhasa Apso seems to be ashamed      Disorder in the house   The doors are coming off the hinges   The earth will open and swallow up the real estate      I just got my paycheck   I'm gonna paint the whole town grey   Whether it's a night in Paris or a Fresno matinee      It's the home of the brave and the land of the free   Where the less you know the better off you'll be      Disorder in the house   All bets are off   I'm sprawled across the davenport of despair      Disorder in the house   I'll live with the losses   And watch the sundown through the portiere.What, (Named Snoop) (Snoop!.It's outrageous the food they try to serve in a public school..The best things in life are free   But you can tell me 'bout the birds and bees..Humming bird, humming bird feathered so fine,   (humming bird feathered so fine)   If I clipped your wings it would not make you mine   (no, no it would not make you mine)   If I clipped your wings it would not make you mine   Humming bird, humming bird feathered so fine,      (humming, humming, humming)      Humming bird, humming bird fly right on by   Some folks like to gamble but, darling, not I   Some folks like to gamble but, darling, not I   Humming bird, humming bird fly right on by      I'd rather be lonely, I'd rather be blue   Yes I'd rather spend my whole life without you   Than feather a nest to be shattered apart   By the hum, hum of your humming bird heart..Don't take me down (Don't take me down with you)   And I don't need no one and no one's ever gonna bring me down..Through the mirror of my mind   Time after time   I see reflections of you and me      Reflections of the way life used to be   Reflections of the love you took from me      I'm all alone now   No love to shield me   Trapped in a world that's   A distorted reality..You think you got everyone figured out   We are leavin' in a glass house   Cause everything is shadowing all around   Now tell me what you mad about   I'm tired of developing nonsense   And if you were to leave me now   I probably do nothing to stop it      Missing you anymore!.Wait!"
"Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8? Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it neccessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at to go industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculatir or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example @MONTH1 need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead @ORGANIZATION1 a book with a few authors."" @CAPS7 day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest @ORGANIZATION1 his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got a half @ORGANIZATION1 a page @ORGANIZATION1 notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the @ORGANIZATION2 computer and got three pages @ORGANIZATION1 notes. ""I was so releived to log on to the internet"", @PERSON1 reported to me. A survey was set up by the @CAPS8 foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and @PERCENT3 said yes. Do you want students @ORGANIZATION1 all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine @ORGANIZATION1 modern day technology. Computers are a magnificent part @ORGANIZATION1 society. @MONTH1 I remind you that computers benefit many jobs in @LOCATION1 and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know. I sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter. What is your vision on computers today?.Make it right (make it right, make it right)   Make it right (make it right, make it right)   Make it right (make it right, make it right)   This time I'll do you right      You know I'ma do you right   You know I'ma do you right   You know I'ma do you right   You know I'ma do you right   I'ma do you right   You know I'ma do you right.All, you old-time queens, from New Orleans, who lived in Storyville   You sang the blues, try to amuse, here's how they pay the bill   The law step-in and call it sin to have a little fun   The police car has made a stop and Storyville is done      Pick out your steamboat, pick yourself a train   A slo-ow train   Pick out your steamboat, pick yourself a train   A slo-ow train   They made you close-up they'll never let you back   Won't let you back   Go buy your ticket or else you walk the track      No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain   The cold-old rain   No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain   The cold-old rain   Just say farewell now and get your one last thrill   Your one last thrill   Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville      No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain   The cold-old rain   Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville      Just say farewell now and get your one last thrill   Your one last thrill   Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville.And their lied....She's no good at being phony   She never tells a good lie   She knows just when to let me be   She always knows when I'm too high   She's never out in front of me   Or way too for   Too for behind   She's always right beside me   Right in the good place all the time   She's so good for me   So good for me   She's so good for me      Good for me yeah   Oh, and when I call her at midnight   Oh, the lady she knows just what to say   She says the words I long to hear   Oh yeah, 'couse that's her way   She knows just what to say   To make me want to stay 'cause that's her way      She's good for me   Oh, so good for me   She's sure enough good for me yeah   So good so good so good she's so good for me oh yeah   She's so good for me   Oh the lady   She's so good for me   Good for me.Come back, baby..She begged for me not to shoot,   ""For my true love is here with me."".Never miss some spiritual down to my bone   Why you takin' jumbo in that zone   She said ""I would do anthing for ?????.I was walking in the rain.Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh..His Papa shook his head and this time he did say:   You can't marry this girl, have to say no,   That girl is your aunty, but your granny don't know!.So there you go, talking bout you miss me so,   That you love me so, why I let you go,   There you go, cause your lies got old,   Now look at you, there you go..too late   Now!.Well, it'll just get you down   If you let life get to you   Cause everybody's saying something   None of it's true      Well, I just don't care   When them times get hard   Cause I got everything I need   Right out in my yard      [Chorus:]   I love my truck   She's right outside   I ain't got much love   But I sure got a ride   It don't matter who lived   It don't matter who lied   I got my truck right by my side      You got Sally and you got Sue   And I got a Chevrolet   She takes me home after work   Don't ever miss a day      She don't care what I am   She don't care what I ain't   But she ain't no cheap pickup   She just needs a couple coats of paint      [Repeat chorus]      Yeah      She don't care   If I don't work a lick   She'll start every time   If the choke don't stick      I know that she will   Never doubt me   Cause she never leaves home   Without me      [Repeat chorus]      I got my truck right by my side, yeah   I got my truck right by my side.Let my perfume, soak into your sweater..I see she's seen the long days and night..This old guitar taught me how to score   Right there on that Lambda Chi porch   Mary Ann taught me a little more   About wantin' what you can't have..Scream my symphony   (screen my sin for me)?.Well I'm standin' on top of the mountain   Just about a mile from Jericho..Am I mad?.Perhaps I have such special needs   I wondered what was wrong with me   My friends all fall so easily   But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know   Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so?.Still segregating 'cause we insects are too proud."
"Dear @CAPS1, The effects computers hace on society is a mixture of positive use and negative use. Getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer. When you are on the computer. When you are on the computer for more than @NUM1 minutes ayou start to get lazy and not wanting to get up. That affects a lot of people @DATE1 because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer. Kids are harder because they don't want to do something other than just sitting on the computer instead of when they come back from school because they are so tired, if we limit the time they use the computer it will be better for kids, grown ups, and your brain. When adults spend a lot of time on the computer due to there jobs or checking their email, a lot of times they don't interact with their family or other people because they are on the computer I can connect with this because @CAPS4 dad is always on the computer due to his office not talking to us or even seeing is. Sometimes I wish that the world should of never invented computers because I get so frustated with them, but a lot of times we do spend family time and its good to get away from your computers beside thats what makes the money. Emailing, chating, @CAPS3, aim, @CAPS2 are all echnology communication using these communcation is helpful if somebody can't text or doesn't have a phone you can always chat them on @CAPS3 or send them an email. Email & @CAPS3 are the only @NUM2 communications I @CAPS4 dad sends use a lot of emails to @CAPS4 soccer coach about how I am not going to be at a game or I am going to a game, and he always responds. It is very easy. @CAPS3 is a good way for kids to talk to one another because some might not have phones or you don't see them at all during the school day. It's a good way to communicate without @CAPS3 or email I don't know what would happen, but I knoe it would be bad. So you see how computers have positives or negatives getting lazy, not spending enough time with friends or family and talking to friends are all positive & negative conflicts of the computer..Fear!.That's what I get..He said,""What I wouldn't give just to   Live those songs again."".Through trials, troubles and care   I know Jesus my savior is there   Giving me faith through

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. For I myself, that I. The internet is a quick way to get the reseach. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. Final grade @CAPS2 I did not type it, on a computer. Typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a neccessity for living..I'll be the hero, you be the star   With your wine and your caviar   No audition, a starring roll   I'll be your Bogart 'n' you be Monroe yeah      Shock me!.All through the day I dream about the night,   I dream about the night, Here with you..And what do we want from each other?.Be Around Trust my Being..I'm dreaming tonight   Of a place I love   Even than more than I usually do   And although I know      It's long road back   I promise you   I'll be home for Christmas   You can count on me      Please have snow   And mistletoe   And presents round the tree   Christmas eve is gonna find me      Where the love light gleams   I'll be home for Christmas   If only in my dreams   I'll be home for Christmas      You can count on me   Please have some snow   And lots of mistletoe   And presents round that tree      Christmas eve is gonna find me   Where the love light gleams   I'll be home for Christmas   If only in my dreams   If only in my dreams.....do you need just a little push?.Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow   So if you want me, I don't come cheap   Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve   Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep   'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight   To say, 'cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight, to say goodnight      Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down   'Cause you don't wanna miss out.[?].180!.I shouldn't have trusted you!.Hope there's room in your world for me (keep a place in your mind for me ?)..If they try and hurt you..I heard the news,   There's good rockin' tonight..Number nine, number nine, number nine   I'm still inside of   The nine asylums   Am I Messiah?.World   Tuesday   Tuesday   World   Tuesday   Tuesday   World      I   I   I   I...try   I   I   I...try   I   I   I      Watched you cry   Watched you fly   Watched you die      I'm the spoonman   Talks to god   Transfusion   Penetration   I'm the spoonman   Talks to god   Transfusion   Penetration   I'm the spoonman   Talks to god   Transfusion   Penetration   I'm the spoonman   Talks to god   Transfusion   Penetration      Watched you cry   Watched you fly   Watched you die      I'm the spoonman   She's a wound   Nice bikini   Steppin razor   I'm the spoonman   She's a wound   Nice bikini   Steppin razor      Watched you cry   Watched you fly   Watched you die      Don't put your hand   Where you wouldn't put your face   She said a dollar rubber rat utah plates   Brilliant green substance unknown with a face like a peeled onion   Sheep in drag horseback automatic   To make your home clean make it sani-flush   She said now I'm a new skin-free   Crispy with this urge to phone into   The nosmoking zone of stainless steel   Tokyo me and big white dog got   To hijack pecan tarts for babylon bambi out of mercer street   Where the crackheads catwalk   Charity   Where teenage sex rides a stoned rhythm   Trading its chiliskins to the screamers come   To hunt their meat to the gold diggers   In kissboots and the recycled blondes in theirstack heeled snatches   The monster trucks the rolling rocks   The poodle boys   With their little bone diggers and dark stuff comes oozing out the apple core tonight   Like a beggars dog tasting the wind      Into the blood.We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend..The kisses of fire, turning to grey..Heel to fifty, huh?.Ain't these tears in these eyes tellin' you?.[Chorus:]   I come to you now when I need you,   But why do I wait to come see you,   I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong cause only with you can I move on..Oh you can see it when you close your eyes   A Norman Rockwell painting come to life   With all the colors of a stained-glass window   All the characters and old dogs and kin folk      And it smells like bar-b-que and old garden roses   Yells like cheerleaders and football coaches   And it walks like a mayor and it dances like a prom   And it sleeps like a porch and it cooks like your mama      Hometown, hometown   May be the sweetest word with the sweetest sound   Hometown      And it's growing like tomatoes on the vine   Fading like a Dr. Pepper sign   Still preaching like a Pentecostal   And fishing like a backslider   And pulling little sisters in bright red radio flyers      And it marches in the veteran's day parade   And it proudly lets old glory wave      It's rodeos and county fairs   All farris wheels and canned up pears   It'll let you go just to welcome you back   No it don't get no better than that      Our hometown, yeah your hometown, hey our hometown, your hometown      Oh you can see it when you close your eyes"
"Dear, local newpaper @CAPS1 it's true technology is blinding everyone. More and more people are being sucked into electronics and less people are caring about our planet. Their are so many great things out there that could be put at risk. People @MONTH1 say that if you spend allot of time on the computer they would be able to find cure's for the deseases out there. Those are just lies to stay lasy and waste their life on the computer. What is going to happen to all of the sports in the world. The players are going to get old and they will retire and if no one is going to take their place then the games would be cancled. I am a big fan of football and I don't want to see it ge cancled. Some of my friends are saying they are addicted to the computer and I always hope they get out of that habit because what's going to happen when they get older they are going to need a @CAPS2. If they stay addicted they won't want a @CAPS2 and they what they won't have money, they can't pay bills, and they would lose their house. Why do people say they could find cures for things by looking on the computer we all know that's not true. They need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer. They @MONTH1 not want to but they would have to look in books and do some heavey thinking before they can find the cures. I hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad. If we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet @CAPS3 will stay around longer and we could make the a better place..Falling, I'm falling      Have you ever walked

"Dear newspaper editor, I think computer are a benefit to everyone. My first reason why I think computers are abenefit is because if you don't know about somthing and you wana learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some research on it. The best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away. The internet has imformation on anything and every thing. my second reason why, is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want. Its not just webcam either you can also go on facebook and other sites like that to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another. my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. Their software on them to write, do projects, and plan things oct. plus most of the modern day society uses computers for stores and business's to keep track of things. Well thats why I think computers benefit us. I told you why I thought they did and how..They're going to wash this planet clean like the bible said   Now you can hold on steady and try to be ready   But everybody's gonna get wet   Don't think it won't happen just because it hasn't happened yet      I'm just rolling away from yesterday   Behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet   I'm going to get a little higher   And see if I can hot-wire reality.This time you're really dead   Once followed, but always led   You thought you'd rise above it all      It's all inside your head   All ripping it up in shreds   I know someday you're gonna fall      And I don't wanna say I told you so   But I told you so   Now you've lost control      And I don't wanna be the rise and fall   So gimme more or nothing at all      You're in an awful way   Sucked in by what you crave   They just can't wait to see you crawl      And you can only laugh   Give in to the other half   They're only tearing down your walls      They've come to see you rise and fall   They're only tearing down your walls   They've come to see you rise and fall   And I don't wanna say you've lost control      Rise and fall is   Good and evil,   Appearance and reality,   Judgment and reflection..(instrumental break)      take look at her hair, it's real   you don't believe what i say just feel..[Chorus]   I'm not worried if the look doesn't last   And there's something in the kiss   I don't need to see past   There's a speech bubble on the top of my head   That everyone sees no matter what I just said I   Think about it... too much...   Talk about it... too much...   Cry about it.. too much...   Too much we're spinning in circles   Only in it for the postcard picture   Only in it for the smoke of the gun..Does life seem worthwhile to you?.[Chorus: x2].Howard: Stop it, man!.If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me..You don't know you're beautiful   If only you saw what I can see   You'll understand why I want you so desperately   Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe   You don't know   Oh!Oh!.Bluejean baby      With your big blue eyes   Don't want you looking   At other guys   Got to make you give me   One more chance   I can't keep still   So baby let's dance      Well the bluejean bop   Is the bop for me   It's the bop that's done   In the dungaree   You dip your hip   You free your knee   Well wiggle on your baby 1 2 3      Well a bluejean bop   Bluejean bop a baby   Bluejean bop Bluejean bop a baby   Bluejean bop   Baby won't you bop with me.Tell him I aint gonna live-I aint gonna live to get much older..(We're bouncing)   We bouncing..The old man rhythm's gotten in my shoes   Know you're sittin' here and singing the blues   So be my guest you got nothing to loose   Won't you let me take you on a see cruise      I said   Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe   Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise      I feel like jumping babe won't you join me please   Oh babe please   I don't like digging but now I'm on that need      I've got to get the rocking get my hat off the rack   The boogie woogie's got me like a knife in a back   I said be my guest you got nothing to loose   Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise      I said   Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe   Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise      I've got to get the moving babe I ain't lying   My heart is beating rhythm and it's right on time   Be my guest you got nothing to loose   Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise      Come on   Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe   Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise      I feel like jumping babe won't you join me please   Come on please   I don't like digging but now I'm on that need      Huey huey babe, huey huey babe, huey huey babe   Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise.When the lost began to sing of   Jesus Christ, the saving one      And we can see that God, You're moving   A mighty river through the nations   And young and old will turn to Jesus   Fling wide Your heavenly gates   Prepare the way of the risen Lord      Open up the doors and let the music play   Let the streets resound with singing   Songs that bring Your hope   Songs that bring Your joy   Dancers who dance upon injustice      Did you feel the darkness tremble   When all the saints join in one song   And all the streams flow as one river   To wash away our brokeness      And here we see that God, You're moving   A time of Jubilee is coming   When young and old return to Jesus   Fling wide your Heavenly gates   Prepare the way of the risen Lord.It sounds more ethnic if it ain't good English   And it don't even gotta rhyme...

"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on computers @MONTH1 be the same as others or different. I believe that computers help our society. They give us more knowledge on whatever subject we want, it helps us connect to family far away places and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? @CAPS1 cousin lives in @LOCATION2 and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer. What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? In you get exercise and can expose the scenery. With a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep. Say your just a young kid and you're always located to see @LOCATION1 but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years. How would you learn more about them if they're gone? A computer has information about anyone you chance. You @MONTH1 not be exercising but you're expanding your knowledge aren't you. Yes you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person. However, what if the book doesn't have the information you are looking for? You could end up reading for hours when the certain information you want wasn't even there. A computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds. Why waste your time? Now is the time where our technology advances. Why waste your time on something when you've got what you need right at your fingertips? So what are you waiting for? Go learn what you want right now! Haven't seen your cousin in a long time? Start up your computer and get talking. The time is now!.Okay, you're ready?.How soft his kiss is..(chorus)   Intellgent we chat intellgent   Intellgent we chat intellgent   Intellgent we chat intellgent   Intellgent we chat intellgent      Jackpot is when you win plenty at money   Jail is a place I don't want to go   January the first month of the year   Jealose is when five women fancy   But john is the proper name fe a english man   Jockey is a profisnel horse rider   Me sah June is the sixth mounth of the year      (chorus)      An jam is when you caint move in a party   Mi say england is a place that covered in snow   Man we drink the ribeana wi don't no like drink beer   But jelly fish jahman mi say them swim in a the sea   Unless you born an bread as a jamican   The pirate them a gather round the jolly roger   Wi wackad as single but wi deadly as a pair      (chorus)      No fe treatment go a hospital   I man pay de rent every Tuesday I man   You a student if you a go to college   Dat a nuff argoument mi say gunny an pablo      Cause a two in a one jab man a two in a one   Two in a one jab man a two in a one   Two in a one jab man a two in a one   Two in a one jab man a two in a one      A say to move from the window   When you come a fiwi dance   But a babylon picl mi up   And a think to myself   Cause I'm going to jail   Man is what a going to tell me girl jab know I man was   So I had to get reckless   Because a two in a one jab   Man a two in a one   Two in a one jab man a two in a one   Two in a one jab man a two in a one   Two in a one jab man a two in a one      Two in a one jab man a two in a one   Seh daddy pablo a long with gunslinger   Seh duw to the circumstances pirate setah in the area   Listen to the style an when we throw down   Because a murder it name   Intelligent we chat intelligent   Intelligent we chat intelligent.Never wanting to work it out..Cooper went out late last night   I heard the slam from her door   Foggy ways, november daze   All the white wolves were smiling   Cooper went out walkin' the clouds   She left everything in a mess   ""Shut your mouth when you talk to me""   Her words were always so small      And there's a sound from the telephone   When can I say she's coming home?.But you have to know,   You just have to see,   I'm having my troubles, babe,   And they're all too much for me..How much have you got?.Or a beginning?.But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin   That's when LL come in   Blast a ass like Apollo 13   Sugar get the cream   Hoppin' dom in every direction   What a scene   He can't understand your best friend's plan   Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man   Good love, have fun, tight hugs and flowers   I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers   Better get down before ya cryin' at home   I got her standing on the bed gettin' closer to the Drop Zone   Some brother's won't appreciate that   Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack?.Don't you worry -

"Dear Local newpaper editor, I think computers benefits us in a good way. Weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. Computers are now a benificial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world. And learn about new things everyday. What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that. It's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. It could be online chatting and even sharing photos. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. If people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. And if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. And if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already I can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read I gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. And how I think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them..Back to who I was   On to find my future   Things my heart still needs to know      Yes, let this be a sign   Let this road be mine   Let it lead me to my past   And bring me home... At last.Was there a witness to this?.Said Derrick wearing the chinos   All I really want is a cup of coffee   So strong the spoon stands up just a cup of coffee   All I really want is a cup of coffee

an espresso   With your coffee scented soap   Maybe you should have some chai tea   Or maybe join me in some tai chi   All I really want is a cup of coffee   In a non-biodegradable cup just a cup of coffee   All I really want is a cup of coffee   Give me a friggin' cup of coffee   Oh Derrick why won't you listen to me   I don't want a magazine or a CD   I don't want a latte or a frappe   Just

"Dear Readers' @ORGANIZATION1 the Local Newspaper, I am almost certain you interact daily with computer. You use computers to write, play games, look at pictures, and print work out. There are dozens @ORGANIZATION1 practical for computers but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage @ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity, expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time. Readers, hear my arguement and by the end @ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise nore or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also plenty @ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"". But do all these & exercise plans really work? According to a study done by the @ORGANIZATION1, the largest cause @ORGANIZATION1 obesity is actually computers! The students at @LOCATION1 had one group @ORGANIZATION1 people try a regular commercial diet plan & another group @ORGANIZATION1 people do exactly what they've been doing... Except their computers. They found that the group who from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 them computer. A familier day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use computer eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. Unfotunately, these happens @NUM1 days a week & the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time. Readers please, try avoiding you computers for just one week, and you can forget those jet plane. Another negative @ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack @ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage. Teens become in their society lives and become to their computers. What they don't notize is that they're totally forgetting about their families! I know I've made the mistake @ORGANIZATION1 becoming too attached to socia networking to remember my family but luckily I have a stable family environment. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships, don't let that happen to you. Your children are without a doubt, through, the ones a by this technical revolution the most. From the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though. Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to profamily, & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sides"". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's & emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without-even knowing. An enormous part @ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ORGANIZATION1 a young age. Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ORGANIZATION1 computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives. @CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @CAPS6? Faced with the concerns @ORGANIZATION1 lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise, separation @ORGANIZATION1 families & mappriate natural children do you really want your children, or even you for that matter, using a computer daily. Think a head @NUM4 years from @CAPS6. Will you say ""I wish I used my computer"" or ""I wish I spent more time"". In the end, the choice is really up to you..I'm waiting for your call,      And I'm waiting to take your 666 in my heart..Nobody knows but me..Lovely disguise, read between the lines   You rock the

From God our heavenly father   A blessed angel came   And unto certain shepherds   Brought tidings of the same   How that in Bethlehem was born   The son of god by name      O tidings of comfort and joy   Comfort and joy   O tidings of comfort and joy      ""Fear not"", then said the angel   ""Let nothing you affright   This day is born a Savior   Of virtue, power, and might   So frequently to vanquish all   The friends of Satan quite""      O tidings of comfort and joy   Comfort and joy   O tidings of comfort and joy      The shepherds at those tidings   Rejoiced much in mind   And left their flocks a-feeding   In tempest, storm, and wind   And went to Bethlehem straightway   This blessed babe to find      O tidings of comfort and joy   Comfort and joy   O tidings of comfort and joy      But when to Bethlehem they came   Whereat this infant lay   They found him in a manger   Where oxen feed on hay   His mother Mary kneeling   Unto the Lord did pray      O tidings of comfort and joy   Comfort and joy   O tidings of comfort and joy      Now to the Lord sing praises   All you within this place   And with true love and brotherhood   Each other now embrace   This holy tide of

"Dear, local Newspaper, I hear that you think computers have an effect on people. Will I disagree with what you say. I think computer will help us learn, and do things faster. Haveing computers helps the community learn more. My first, reason I think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs. With the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of @LOCATION1 where they type every day and work hard. They also learn more and more facts about the sociatis. Without knowing how to type you @MONTH1 not get any top class jobs. My second, reason telling us that computers are helpful is that it helps your children do better in school by learning how to type for high school, and learning math, sce, social studies and language arts. Computers also helps kids at young age do math and other with their character, like dora, @ORGANIZATION1, elmo, and others. So learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time. Which i know your parents would like. Even new born babys can learn how to read, write and do math and grow up and can be president one day. My third, reason is that it helps send things all over the world. Without computers we would have to do it old fashion style. Also with computers you can talk to family member that live far away from you (In state or country) and you have not see them in a long time. Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day. You can also buy thing off the computer. In my conclution I told you that computers can not effect people by telling you that your child can do better learning and parents also. I also add that it helps you get jobs and help you with your hand and eye cordination in school and out. So computer help the community..Hey vie got so much inside me to give   What can I do?.She said   ""I love you baby it's for always   And I don't care what the teacher says."".Everybody's gay, everybody's gay!.The kind that you find when you mind your own mysteries..I get weary,   And sick of trying I'm tired of living,   But scared of dying,   That old man river,   He just keeps rolling along..I believe your new girl turned you down   And they say she's pushin' you around   How does it feel, I guess it hurts your pride   Tell me my friend how many nights you've cried      Disaster and disgrace   The king has lost his crown   Suddenly   He's clumsy like a clown   The world is upside down   The king has lost his crown      Was it hard to step down from your throne   And to know tonight you're all alone   Oh what a shame, you really want that girl   She doesn't care, still you just dream of her      Disaster and disgrace   The king has lost his crown   Suddenly   He's clumsy like a clown   The world is upside down   The king has lost his crown      Disaster and disgrace   The word is all around   Suddenly   He's clumsy like a clown   The world is upside down   The king has lost his crown.Beyond rubies is our little girl!.If we didn't buss,   Every artist woulda fraid of us..And before you set me free, oh listen please      [Chorus]      That somebody's me   That somebody's me.Ooh!.Wouldn't that be something?.But ooh if you're leaving..I never wanted another   Come over to me and discover   How I want to be near you   And you need to be far away   You always seem to make me feel at home   Hey you      People like   I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why   You make me wanna cry   I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why   Forever live and die      I look at all of the people   Doing it over and over   You never get any older   I wish that you could be here   I look at you and I   Make the same mistakes   Hey you      People like   I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why   You make me wanna cry   I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why   Forever live and die      I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why   You make me wanna cry   I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why   Forever live and die      Repeat to fade.Where that nigga Hugh Heff   When we pull up at the light   Why everything else get left?.It's gonna--be--me   Oh, yeah      You might been hurt, babe   That ain't no lie   You've seen them all come and go, oh   I remember you told me   That it made you believe in   No man, no cry   Maybe that's why      [Chorus]   Every little thing I do   Never seems enough for you   You don't want to lose it again   But I'm not like them   Baby, when you finally   Get to love somebody   Guess what   It's gonna be me      You've got no choice, babe   But to move on, and you know   There ain't no time to waste   So just you're just too blind, to see   But in the end, ya know it's gonna be me   You can't deny   So just tell me why      Every little thing I do   Never seems enough for you   You don't want to lose it again   But I'm not like them   Baby, when you finally   Get to love somebody (somebody)   Guess what (guess what)   It's gonna be me      It's gonna be me   Oh yeah      There comes a day   When I'll be the one, you'll see      It's gonna-gonna-gonna-gonna   Justin: It's gonna be me   All that I do is not enough for you   Don't want to lose it   But I'm not like that   When finally (finally)   You get to love   Guess what?.Come on!.Revolution   What do we want?.Is my living in vain?.I'm bleeding bad   I'm bleeding on the floor   Help... help....Your arms around me   How can I complain   With your arms around me   Uhm, I know I'm a lucky man      With your arms around me   Honey, I'm taller than a tree   So all I can say is   Keep those arms around me      When I woke up this morning   Oh, I had an aching head   The pain was so great   Uhm, I almost fell out of bed      Then you put your arms around me   Then you kiss me three times   And in a matter of seconds   I never felt so fine, oh no, oh yes I did      With your arms around me   I can feel no no no no pain   With your arms around me   Uhm, I know I'm the worlds strongest man      With your arms around me, yeah   If I was blind I know that I could see, oh now   All I can say is   Keep those loving arms around me   Oh now, oh now, oh now.A shadow on the sane   The final treachery of god."
"Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways or doing things for other people, and people have to manage alot of there money and hills on the computer. First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons..Fly you straight to heaven and Step with   You while the angels sing..Flames   I see electric flames ya'll   They, are, burning all over   All over me   Voodoo, Voodoo   That's what they call it now   And you best better   Go on and let it be   But I always been a gamblin' man   So you know I'm gonna, gonna, gonna   Gonna take a chance   Here's my?.Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!.I love the ring of your name, your the ying to my yang,   Oh baby let's give it a shot!.I've got a new pastime to chew on..Doctor, won't you tell me, am I going insane   Was it something I ate or something wrong with my brain   See, I'm naked in church when I meet a dinosaur   Try to run, but my feet have been nailed to the floor   Then a midget pushes me through a revolving door   And I'm back in the very same place I was before      Now I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White   I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White   Night after night after night after night      And I can't bust out and I can't break free   And it's gettin' just a little too stuffy here for me   And I can't go home and I can't get loose   And I try to escape but it's just no use      And I can't ever leave and I can't ever win   And we're runnin' outta air and the walls are closin' in   And I can't go back and I can't get through   But Vanna since you're here, why don't you let me buy a vowel from you      Come on Vanna, come on!.Imagine the love   Of a child for his toys,   The love of a bird   For it's mate,   Imagine the love   Of a miser for gold,   Then imagine a love   Twice as great..Punch and Judy,   In a semi,   On a brand new council plot,   Sunday lunchtime,   Beer-for-Punch time,   While his dinner's far from hot,   She grows tired,   Cab is hired,   She goes round to see her friend,   He comes back late,   Fool is irate,   We will see his temper bend..Je m'abandonne   (I want to go to the end of my fantasies   I know it is forbidden   I am crazy..Together we can make it..Oh the tree of life is growing   Where the spirit never dies   And the bright light of salvation   Shines in dark and empty skies      When the cities are on fire   When the burning flesh of men   Just remember that death is nt the end   And you search in vain to find      Just one law abiding citizen   Just remember that death is not the end..She's got an eye on you   There's nowhere to hide   She keeps her motives still   Deep down inside      She shows no mercy, no   She plays it rough   She don't want no money   She just wants to love      Love stealer, raw dealer   Heart breaker, love taker   Yeah yeah...

"@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the world say that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about forgien people and places and also learn about where your family came from. So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. Another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? Well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. For example, @LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family.

"Typing and surfing the web @MONTH1 be exciting; however, is it worth the @CAPS1 risks that there are now? Before computers were discovered, human's healthyness is triple than what it is now. Computers can be useful and @MONTH1 have some benefits; on the other hand, they are harmful and they should not be used as often. They have unprofessional websites, they are not helpful when it comes to excercise, and they disturb @CAPS1 individuals privacy. @CAPS1 kids are let onto computers every day and they wonder @ORGANIZATION1 to the websites that the internet has to offer. Consequently, kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on. In fact, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 kids enter unproffesional websites and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 them have no parental vision in the @LOCATION1 alone. Therefore, @CAPS1 kids act up in homes and at school. However kids are not the only ones who are affeted by this. Computers have a disadvantage @ORGANIZATION1 being hacked or virused from uncensored websites. MOreover, computers crash or don't allow use @ORGANIZATION1 computer documents because @ORGANIZATION1 these viruses. Ever since the @ORGANIZATION2 was invented obesity and lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise in a person's schedule has skyrocketed.

I believe that this is definitely true because I remember that the same happened to my sister. She ate more and her excercise time was spent more on the computer that on her body. I know that @CAPS1 say that computers help in hand-eye coordination, however, is it really worth more than someones healthy body? @CAPS1 things are sold on the internet that are not in stores, but you don't trust the internet when buying these products.

"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be..Uh..(ha ha, ha ha-hah ha)   (ha-hah, ha-hah-ha, ha ha-hah) Get off my niggy niggy nuts!.Inside out

"Dear newspaper, Computers are everywhere in our nation. We have them at home, at @ORGANIZATION1 or at our work. Many people believe that computers are bad for our health or we don’t spend enough time with our family. But I disagree. Computers teach hand-eye coordination let us learn about faraway places, and also let us allow to chat online with other people. Have you ever had trouble with hand-eye coordination? Sometimes mine is ridiculous! But when i get on a computer it gets to be much better. Experts say that @PERCENT1 more people with hand-eye coordination have improved by working with computer. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS1 students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand-eye coordination already."" I agree with these experts too. So many people nowadays that have a computer have passed their hand-eye coordination test! When I grow up and soon get out of high @ORGANIZATION1 I want to travel all over the world. But first I want to be educated on where I go. That is why computers are so helpful. I can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where I can learn all about the places I want to visit. @CAPS2 time @CAPS1 parents told me we were going to @LOCATION1 for the day. So the night before I did a bunch of research of different shops, museums, and places to eat. The computer helped me so much that if we didn't have @CAPS2 then i don't know where would go. President @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS2 time when i had a big meeting in @LOCATION3 I had no knowledge about it. So I logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture, language, and much more. I dont know what I would do if I didn't have a computer."" I love talking to @CAPS1 friends. But once I'm home none of @CAPS1 friends are around me, so I have nobody to talk to. If I also don't have the phone available then that makes it even worse.But, if I go on the computer then I can talk to bunch of @CAPS1 friends. I can go onto @CAPS1 webcam to see who I am talking to or I can go onto another website to get an instant message. I love talking online because ont of @CAPS1 best friends in the whole word moved down to @LOCATION2 so I don't get to talk to her too much. But if I go to the instant message website then I can talk to her as much as I want. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people sold in a survey that they have someone they talk to over the internet. So I say the computer is important in our society. It helps complete a number of tasks.

"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?.Baby when I think about (about, about)   The day that we first met (the day that we first met)   Wasn't lookin' for what I found   But I found you   And I'm bound to by happiness in being around you      [Chorus]   I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you   I'm glad for the way you make me feel   I love it cause you seem to blow my mind every time   I'm glad when I walk you hold my hand   I'm happy that you know how to be a man   I'm glad that you came into my life   I'm so glad      I dig the way that you get down   (You get down for 'bout)   And you still know how to hold me   (And you still know how to hold me)   Perfect blend, masculine   I think I'm in love, damn finally      [Chorus]      I'm glad, that you, turned out, to be   That certain someone special   Who makes this life worth living   I'm glad, you're here, just loving me   So say that you won't leave   Cause since the day you came   I've been glad      [Chorus].Pourquoi me reveiller, o souffle

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that the computer is good for the society because, @CAPS2 and student's do most of the studies online. We spend most of our time with our family and friends so we want a little bit of time to ourselves. We learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of facts. After reading this essay I hope you will agree with my position. @CAPS2 student's put most of their notes on a laptop and study what they did in class on the computer. @CAPS6 they need to look something for history class they have internet. High @CAPS3 @CAPS4 don't like going to the library so they go on the internet as there source. So @CAPS6 a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat the computer will write the project neatly. The computer/internet has became a big source of learning to our society don't you agree? Our time most of the time is spent with our families @CAPS7 not our friends came over. Go outside and play with them, sit down and play games. Our families we are so little bit of time to ourselves computer won't hurt nobody. We don't on forever we friends or search something useful @CAPS5 we talked to our families @CAPS6 we go online searching for they couldn't fire. People countries to see @CAPS7 enough to visit for @CAPS7 they wanna that country they need a resource that is up to date. A computer is constantly updated with new fact's about everything. I hope after reading this you will agree with my position. Mostly every person has a computer and it does not effect there lives a lot. A computer is a great resource for the public. People wanna meet new people so they use a computer to do so student's want a great grade on those project so they wanna present it nicely.

"Computers are not having a negative affect on society. In fac when you talk with someone online @CAPS1 helps build relationship within that person. A use for computer that is also use full is hand eye coordination. Education is also a useful thing you can use with computers. You can learn about faraway places and monuments. The myth is that computers ruin relationship between friends and family however, In some ways @CAPS1 improves them, when you go on skype you talk with some one online. By doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person. This information proves that computers can actually suport replationships.

"Computers are something everyone uses but there is a time when you get off and start expericing life. Computers do teach hand-eye cordination, let you talk to friends and family, and give you the chance to learn about faraway places and people. But it alos causes people to spend more time of the computer and less time exrcising enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Excercise is a big thing in peoples life. It people, in shape and healthy @PERCENT1 of obeseity is caused by of the computers. Staying on all day sitting down rating. I think these should be a limit on a computer so people spend less time on the computer and more exercising. Most people dont know what it does to them but  time they get unhealthier and weaker. They dont know that sitting down for hars and hars eating a bag a chips does time. Once they start doing it, it because a habit and eating and just go on the computer for hars and hars. Not only does it decrease the time peole spend exercising it also decreases the time people spend enjoying and the Computers are addicting you go on for five minutes and you forget all what you do before you know it you have @CAPS1 hours.

"What if you're family all and to talk to them percent of people commucate online, and thats not a bad thing. Heres the thing, are you for or against kids/parents online for too long. I am all for this. Reasons being are lots of kids have friends that they talk to online, secondly kids have homework/projects that they might have to look up online, and my last reason for this is, some family might have @CAPS1 ect, so they can communicate online. My first reason for this is, a lot of kids have friends online that can't text or even talk on the phone, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now. ""I think the internet is a great things, I mean I would rather have my kids online than outside roaring the and getting into troupe."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1. @NUM1 of @NUM2 kids are online communicating with others. Without a doubt, kids bring home projects and homework everyday right? Wouldn't you rather your kid looking up information online, then have them guessing and getting it wrong? I know that alot of children don't have computers, internet or essy, or maybe their got allowed online. That's why they. I remember the times when I had a project due at school, and I guessed on. that didn't do my grade any good. So then I decided the next time I have a project to do it on the internet. And it worked, I got a much better grade then I did on the one I guessed on. Lastly, mostly everybody has on the internet and would live to and with them while. So even stay online too often your not on it for a bad reason, your on to talk to your family."" @CAPS3 I got internet in my house, I barly ever got to talk to my family. But just then, my son me to get one, and I have the chance to talk to my family everyday. @CAPS2 a recent of a computer. Some people do say on the computer for too long at times, and don't get out on exercise the amount a humane should. or they don't get out of the house as much as they used to @CAPS3 they got the internet. Yes but, it's a good cause, it's not like because forever. Also it's being used for good. Not for anything bad. I think the internet is a great thing, and it puts a effect on many people. Reasons are, kids have friends online to talk too, ""lots of that needs internet, and last of people have family online to talk to so it's now or get out there and your best pick.

"With the click of a mouse, you can access the internet. Computers and internet are a recent innovation. You could probably find one in a common household. They've improved and gotten popular within the last twenty years. I believe they greatly benefit society. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate. Think about how life would be in the @DATE1 without computers. Different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources; such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. The computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it. It's as easy as that. Another benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to @LOCATION1 due to jobs. Thanks to internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them. Im sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messanger, or facebook, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convienent than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you. If we didn't have this connection with forgein countries, everyone’s lives would be different. Computers haven't just changed personal lives. They change the medical field too. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures. Computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis. This saves the lives of many people. @PERCENT1 of tests that have taken place to research a dicsease use a computer of some sort to break it down. The technology of computers has benefitted today’s society and has helped people achieve great things. It keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn. I hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today..There's a time for the good in life,   a time to kill the pain in life,   dream about the sun you queen of rain      It's time

stars get in your eyes...don't let the moon break your heart!).In the back street, in the back street I gave you my jelly roll,   Ah, I gave it to you, ha ha..I can't hold on to him..Chorus:   So lay your curly head upon your pillow   While your faithful dog stands watching over you   Close your tired little eyes   While I croon a lullaby   And you'll ride the trail to dreamland, buckeroo....Avoiding this is like avoiding a plague   We can't understand the advances we made   We've tried to resist but it's so hard to say no   We're pretending to see what the future will hold   We appear to be in control of our fate   Just like soldiers believe they're in control of a war   But it's moving so fast we cannot see what we've done   We're losing our eyes just to say that we've won      My mind's made up, my heart is broke   My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked   I can't understand how we could ever believe   The things we asked for but never received      We never understood the times we asked   The way we wasted all that passed   This neglect is final it's a stage we must   Endure to ever hope to see the first   My mind's made up about the things we did   We never saw we believed we couldn't say what we missed      My mind's made up, my heart is broke   My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked   I can't understand how we could ever believe   The things we asked for but never received      By making noises which we cannot control   The things we hoped that we'd never forgo   We appear to be in control of our fate   Just like soldiers believe they're in control of a war   But it's moving so fast we cannot see what we've done   We're losing our eyes just to say that we've won      My mind's made up, my heart is broke   My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked   I can't understand how we could ever believe   The things we asked for but never received.Feel the fire!.But we won't let it go for   Nothin'   (No not for)   Nothin'..Burned by the glory of a sacred fire   A rising force starts to shine   Alone in the inferno it soars ever higher   Leaving the demons behind..You know how sticky these situation get   You go up higher than me some days   You know what I think we could be some day   Let me at least show you my side of things, man   Aw man, aw man   Aw man.But time went by so fast   Till I couldn't see their attractions at all..Beyond two thousand in the future wars beyond the limits of our mind   Central computer that control and know the simple weakness of mankind   Humanoid living in a structured will walking in a lifeless path   Motor with a need to kill need to kill need to kill   Searching through the wreckages of molten steel and glass seeing all in infra red and heavy in its mass   Terminate exterminate the son of Connor Reese you must prevent the bastard ever being born   Stop at nothing kill at will but rid the earth of this small child you must deter this fucking evil spawn   Mark the dogs for only they know your not human your ot flesh at all   Break the jaw before it speaks and kill the men that answer to its call   Justified in genocide and leave them in theiir broken pride until they realize that it's no use   Unsuspecting victim one guerilla fighter with a gun the terminator's finally been let loose   Try to run but only they know there's nowhere to run nowhere to hide   Cornered trapped by the death machine don't you go to sleep don't close your eyes ah   Beyond twp thousand in the future wars beyond the limits of our mind   Central computer, that control and know the simple weakness of mankind   And still the armies of robotic men crushing the humans in their path   Lifeless of pain and a void of sorrow create a crimson aftermath.Kansas City, Kansas City here I come

"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think people need to see the realatey from computer's and the real world, they're a lot of people spending to much time on the computer and not spending enough time with there familys or doing things that are really important. While your on the computer your not getting any exsercise your not getting stronger your just sitting down. Thats one of the ways people get fat because there not moveing around just sitting down. When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on. I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter! But you really can't tell people how long there allowed to spend on the computer you can only give an opinon and hope they listen..""What do you mean?"".I don't want to lose you..She rides in the

inside sat down had a few drinks   But all he kept talking about was      Glory days well they'll pass you by   Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye   Glory days, glory days      Well there's a girl that lives up the block   Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads   Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by   And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed   Her and her husband Bobby well they split up   I guess it's two years gone by now   We just sit around talking about the old times,   She says when she feels like crying   She starts laughing thinking about      Glory days well they'll pass you by   Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye   Glory days, glory days      Think I'm going down to the well tonight   And I'm going to drink till I get my fill   And I

"There has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society. I personnaly agree with th statement that computers benefit in society. I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her year of practice, she becamr very computer coordinated. My hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand-eye coordination practice ever."" @CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer, people can look up information on countries for pleasure too. Mu mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schoold too. My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states. Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back. I remeber I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said ""video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right inforn of them talking with them. These reasons are why I think computers are a big help in our society..I walk it up   I walk it down   I know not what I do      Your love is a sword   Made of folded gold   In the shape of my heart      I walk it up   Walkin' blind   Walkin' blind      All I heard was him   All I saw were eyes   By the world begun      I walk it down   Walkin' blind   Walkin' blind      Angel falling, angel blessed   Sister how fair is your love   I know not what I do      Walkin' blind   Walkin' blind      From the face of love to love   From the face of love to love.And do you feel me beside you in your bed,   There beside you, where I used to lay?.When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd   And made them wild   In an atmosphere of freaky holiday..Now they've swapped that good old carthorse for a car?.A street walker when there's time to spare   Big spenders holding their share   A heart of gold, but no one cares..I told you baby, once before   Don't want you messin'   Outside my door   You better find another shoulder   Find another shoulder   Find another shoulder   'Cause honey,   I don't love you anymore..Saw you peeking' round my garden gate   I thought you'd liked what you'd seen   So I said, ""Darlin' if you want a little of these peaches,   Just come on and shake my tree. "".Pouring my wine in your eyes caged mine glowing   Touching your face my fingers strayed knowing..Don't know how to tell you, I don't know what to say,   Something has come over me, since you came my way..We could make a pillow of sand and sleep   We could roll   We could make   We could see   We could scream      Far, Father, Farthest   Oh daddy, you do not do anymore      For God's sake don't pretend to be concerned   Turn into nightmares in the end   Throw a party for all my friends      I..Got me a date with a supermodel..sometimes I worry about you   Every day I feel the same, don't you feel it too   I say, Baby ..You'll take away my peace of mind   You'll leave me there to rot and die   But look again, my careless friend   The world you live is just a lie   It's a give and take, the more the fake   The more the pain, the more you lose   Live your life, don't take no sides   N'seize the day and drink your booze!.I'm gonna move right outta this town..You'll never be the sun turning in the sky   And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night   And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright   But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light   You may not always shine as you go barefoot over stone   You might be so long together or you might walk alone   And you won't find that love comes easy but that love is always right   So even when the dark clouds gather you will be the light   And if you lose the part inside when loves turns round on you   Leaving the past behind is knowing you'll do like you always do   Holding you blind, keeping you true   You'll never be the sun turning in the sky   And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night   And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright   But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light.Chorus:   Where did your heart go   Did you put it on a train   Did you leave it in the rain   Or down in Mexico      You cry, but I don't know   I've heard it all before   There it goes again, the slamming of the door   Sometimes the river calls me   And at night it calls my name   Says ""put your troubles down beside me""   Things have always been the same...   And rock 'n' roll won't teach me   What the river said that night   I jumped into this beauty   And drifted out of sight....There's a cat in town that you might know   He goes by the name of Domino   A long tweed jacket and a diamond ring   A blue sport car, he's a crazy king   They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino      Well the girls all think that he's a real gone guy   They all flip when he walks by   Shanty clothes and cool white shoes   He's rearm' to go and never sings the blues   They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino      He's got cool black hair and a solid style   Long side-bums and a crazy smile   A thousand girls, they'll tell you so   They dig that cat called Domino   They love him so that cat called Domino, Domino, Domino   Well Domino, cool man go, Domino, they love him so   Get out of the way, here comes Domino, Domino, Domino.That's just the first verse.You shine a little love on my life   You shine a little love on my life   You shine a little love on my life and let me see..Woman I can hardly express,   My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness,   After all I'm forever in your debt,   And woman I will try to express,   My inner feelings and my thankfulness,   For showing me the meaning of success,   Ooh well, well, do do do do do do   Ooh well, well, do do do do do do      Woman I know you understand   The little child inside the man,   Please remember my life is in your hands,   And woman hold me close to your heart,   However distant don't keep us apart,   After all it is written in the stars,   Ooh well, well, do do do do do do   Ooh well, well, do do do do do do      Woman please let me explain,   I never meant to cause you sorrow and pain,   So let me tell you again and again and again,   I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,   I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,   I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,   I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever.Who I think is cool,   Walking outside my door,   Peeking everyday."
"Technology is advancing every day. One main technilogical device that is popular is the computer. More and more people are using them, however, not everyone agrees that it benifits society. I believe that it does benifit us. One reason is that you can explore things at home. Before computers you would have to go to the library, find the book you need, and then search through it until you found the information you needed. Those things alone could take hours, especially if you don't live near on library. However, with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what your looking for. That could save you gas money because you don't have to drive anywhere. Another reason is that you can communicate online for free. Without a computer you would either have to go see that person by driving, talking on the phone, or texting, wich are all expensive. On the computer you have e-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many more. All of them you can communicate in different ways. If you want to look at pictures, take quizes, play games, or talk, thats @CAPS2. And finally for e-mail, you can send people letters videos, or you can just talk to other people by typing like all the others..There's a world....Baby there's no need to be naive, blindfolded..We all want everything,   But we all can't fit in the door..Whispering of names, faces   Uniforms I've worn   And all that is gone   Always climbing   To fall down again   Holding onto everything   It's not what it seems      I've been told, dreaming's free   Think I'll go back to sleep      Everybody listen   Voices in my head   Everybody listen   Does yours say what mine says?.I'll remember forever   When I was but three   Mama, who was clever   Remarking to me   If son when you're grown up   You want everything nice   I've got your future sewn up   If you take this advice      Be a clown, be a clown   All the world loves a clown   Act the fool, play the calf   And you'll always have the last laugh      Wear the cap and the bells   And you'll rate with all the great swells   If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread   If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead   You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head   Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown      Be a clown, be a clown   All the world loves a clown   Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes   And you'll only stop with top folks      Be a crack Jackanapes   And they'll imitate you like apes   Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears   Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years   When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears   Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown      Be a clown, be a clown   All the world loves a clown   If you just make 'em roar   Watch your Mounte bank account soar      Wear a painted mustache   And you're sure to make a big splash   A college education I should never propose   A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes   But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose   Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown      Give 'em quips, give 'em fun   And they'll happy to say you're A-1   If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck   If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck   But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck   Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown.Lost inside a room   The priest at the door with news   Said you were gone now I knew   Oooh my world was broken in two   I prayed that you were here   To hold my heart   I'd hide myself in your bed   And cry myself numb      Oh god I miss you   Tell me can you hear me   Oh god I miss you   I can't scream and I can't speak   Show me now   Will I ever be free from you      Lost inside my head   I close my eyes and fled   No pain no gain   No death no more   I drown myself in flesh   There's no way out   No way how   Do you even know me now   I finally see

 Can you hear me now      Oh god I miss you   Tell me can you hear me   Oh god I miss you   I can't scream and I can't speak   Show me now   Will I ever be free from you      Oh god I miss you   Tell me can you hear me   Oh god I miss you   I can't scream and I can't speak   Tell me how   Will I ever be free from you.(Know what I'm saying   Like that   Yeah)      [Chorus: x3]   Out of this world

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, i do not believe that computers benefit society, I feel this way because I have heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time doing unproductive things. The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising. Now, lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends. Computers are very addicting, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them, though I can understand why certain individuals do it I dont think its right. I have many friends who would rather be on facebook or myspace than hang out with me. The web site listed above can really make you forget about reality. My friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day. The reasons listed above tell you why I believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose. Now, lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users. i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it. So when I read about people wasting time on the computer all day I, myself, was very upset! Statistics show that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours a day on average on the internet, statistics also show that the average aldut spends about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours on the computer a day on average. When I read the above statistics I came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing. Now, lets talk about exercising a bit more. I, myself, know that too much time is being spent on computers. By me knowing that I am aware of the fact that children are not exercising. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need it can cause health problems in the future,. Statistics show that around @PERCENT1 of children under @NUM4 years of age are obese. The above reasons tell you why I believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. Now, lets bring this letter to an end..I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie,   I'll always be with you   This rose will never die, this rose will never die..Even when the sun is shinning I can't avoid the lightning      Oh where did the blue sky go?.So this is what it feels like   Be in at the right place, the right time   I'm bringing off a delight   Hoping we can make this a long night   This is why we came, yeah I can feel it in my veins hey yeah   So this is what it feels like   Right place the right time      Loud explosions only you and I can hear   Doors fly open, you're the cure for all my fears   All I see is you and I   You're the only lifeline, that I need tonight   I'm letting go..Always get the reaction you wanted   I'm actually fronting   I'm askin' you something   Yo, answer this question,   Class is in session,   Tired of letting   Passive aggression   Control my mind,   Capture my soul   OK your right   Just let it go..But I cling to a hope till I can't hold on anymore...anymore...   And for all the acclaim, I am all alone!.There is no blame here, we both end up the same here   A little wiser than we were      There was a time this would have killed me   And it may still be hard to look you in the eye   And now that all the spells are broken   The truth's been spoken   My heart has the strength to tell him goodbye      And now that we're face to face   And I put myself in your place   I see the truth I see who's really to blame      And I won't play his game or try to get even   He'll know he's lost watching us leaving   I blamed you, but I see my mistakes   Now that we're face to face      I won't play his game or try to get even   He'll know he's lost watching us leaving   I blamed you, but I see my mistakes   Now that we're face to face   Now that we're face to face.It's the Circle of Life   And it moves us all   Through despair and hope   Through faith and love   Till we find our place   On the path unwinding   In the Circle   The Circle of Life.Just another slimy bore..I've known about you for a while now   When he leaves me he wears a smile   Now as soon as he's away from me   In your arms is where he wants to be      Kelly:   But you're the one he rushes home to   Youre the one he gave his name to   I've never seen his face in the early morning light   You have his mornings his daytimes   And sometimes I have his nights      Both:   But does he love you (does he love you)   Like he loves me (like he loves me)   Does he think of you (does he think of you)   When he's holding me   Does he whisper all of his fantasies   Does he love you (does he love you)   Like he's been loving me      Kelly:   But when he's with me   He says he needs me   And that he wants me   That he believes in me      Reba:   And when I'm in his arms   How he swears there's no one else   Is he deceiving me   Or am I deceiving myself      Both:   Does he love you (does he love you)   Like he loves me(like he loves me)   Does he think of you (does he think of you)   When he's holding me   And does he whisper all of his fantasies   Does he love you (does he love you)   Like he's been loving me      Oooh shouldn't I loose my temper   Oooh shouldn't I be ashamed   'cause I have everything to loose   I have nothing to gain      Does he love you (does he love you)   Like he loves me (like he loves me)   Does he think of you (does he think of you)   Whens he's holding me   Does he whisper you all of his fantasies   Does he love you (does he love you)   Like he's been loving me      Ooooh   Does he love you?.I was always in the club, got every chick to give it up, oooh..You break down my walls   With the strength of your love..For long you live and high you fly   But only if you ride the tide   And balanced on the biggest wave   You race towards an early grave..And on Earth,   Peace to All Men   Hear the joyful angels singing   Hallelujah!.It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters   And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh

"Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that nature is better than spending way too much time in the computer? Well, generally speaking, I think it is and i'll give you only three reasons why. First of all, it's about the obesity percentage in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend a lot more time with your family. Finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer. Also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 are obese or overweighted. Last year in @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. Wow, the rate went went up like @PERCENT3 in each year. This info was online at www.tomatotalks.org. Another thing I would like to consider, spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing. All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere especially at the dinner table is a great way to talk about your child's problem's in school, and also to learn their parent's mistakes too. Also share great laugh's. Finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future. Last, but not least, you can enjoy the greater outdoors, and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about. Also trees that gives us oxygen too. Mother nature has it's great benefits when your career is all about science. Computers are educational but nature is better!.Turn it uppppppppppp Get with it!.It makes you burn to learn   I'm with another man..I like your brother   I like your mother   And I like you !.(Hello, I Love You - Doors)      Hello I love you   Lets get tested for aids   You know I trust you   But you can't tell these days   Hello I love you   Lets get tested for aids   You know I want you   But let's wait a few days      She might look nice and sweet   But sleeps with every guy she meets   You might think you know some guy   But you know guys and they always lie      Hello I love you   Lets get tested for aids   You know I trust you   But you can't tell these days   Hello I love you   And liked to get laid   You know I want you   But I'm deathly afraid      She holds my hand and sighs   But her hand won't satisfy   Our thoughts are wicked   But our legs are crossed   And I doubt I can hold out too long      The doc won't know for at least a week   I'm like a dog locked up when my mate's in heat   And I hope she doesn't see me drool   Cuz I hope to use my rusty tool      Hello, hello   Hello, hello   Hello, hello      'Uh, Hullo?

"Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are good. You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that we.Don't you see you're breaking the child in two?.Oh it must have been while you were kissing me..I can never quit      Everything is very quiet   Everyone has gone to sleep   I'm wide awake on memories   There memories can't wait..Get as rowdy as Roesthlisberger in a bathroom stall....Remember the good old 1980's,   When things were so uncomplicated,   I wish I could go back there again   And everything could be the same..Oh, hear the angel voices   Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born   Oh night divine, Oh night, Oh night Divine.Do you know any more about God?.Pull your card and I'm askin' yo' name, bitch..I'm not crazy just frustrated.Now when I'll treat the way we all was born to love her   But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her   And I run but I wait   And it's not too fast or slam   But I'll not perceive her   I'm not there I'm gone..Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head      Kaw-Liga was a lonely indian, never went nowhere   His heart was set on the indian maid with the coal black hair   Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show   So she could never answer yes or no      Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss   Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed   Is it any wonder that his face is red?.Trudging slowly over wet sand   Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen   This is the coastal town   That they forgot to close down   Armageddon - come Armageddon!.Now that love is you everything is right,   And lonliness is the other side   Of the world....Come on baby      I get so confused,   But, my heart knows you're one of a kind   Leather an' lace, an angels face,   Riding on a one track mind   You're fully loaded with cruise control,   My four wheels rock with your back seat roll      You're cheap an' nasty,   All you want to do is give it up, give it up   Cheap an' nasty,   Come on an' do the dirty with me      I get so excited, babe, when I'm invited   To ride in your limousine,   You drive it every day, burn it every night,   I wonder how you keep it so clean   Smooth accelerator, you get me so loose,   You keep your motor running till I run out of juice      You're cheap an' nasty,   All you want to do is give it up, give it up   Cheap an' nasty,   Come on an' do the dirty with me      Cheap an' nasty      I never knew it could be this way   An' I never thought I'd ever complain,   But, gimme a second just to catch my breath   Babe, before you do it again      All the boys call your name   Down the wishing well,   Baby, when you go   You're like a cat out of hell      You're cheap an' nasty,   All you want to do is give it up, give it up   Cheap an' nasty,   All you want to do is give it up, give it up   Cheap an' nasty,   All you want to do is give it up, give it up   Cheap an' nasty,   Come on an' do the dirty with me      Come on an' do the dirty,   Come on an' do the dirty,   Come on an' do the dirty with me   Come on an' do the dirty with me.La la la la la la   La la la la la la   La la la la,   Baby I love you      But if you want to leave take good care,   Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there,   But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware      Well, baby, baby it's a wild world,   It's hard to get by just upon a smile..I am dejected..Ezekiel cried, ""Dem dry bones!"".Now you see it, now you don't   Careful of words that get caught in your throat   Face the music..Now the day is gone,   And I sit alone and think of you, girl   What can I do without you in my life?.(It's that greasy kid stuff."

"Dear, To who it @MONTH1 concer, I am writing this to inform about how the ocmputers benefits society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use @CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or @CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People sue @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they @MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people @MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them..Now he's gone..Do you know how long I've waited?.1, 2,

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that people are spending to much time on computers, and I agree because people spend so much time on computers that @CAPS2 gets addicting, people don’t get enough exersize, and eyesite gots worse. So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of the computer. Most of all @CAPS2 gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer just to chek @CAPS3 and facebook like I do but I just check my facebook and the go play basket ball. One of the biggist problem that I think is when you sit on the computer to long and get a head ache and ruins your ey site. So thank you for reading my letter and hope you agree with me..Once they were in a scandal that shook the town..You are my dream maker   Chasing away all of my blues   With these dreams of me and you   Dream maker, make my dreams come true..I don't know if it's cloudy or bright      Ryder with Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe:   I only have eyes for you, dear      Ryder:   The moon maybe high   But I can't see a thing in the sky      Ryder with Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe:   I only have eyes for you      Ryder:   I don't know if we're in a garden   Or on a crowded avenue   You are here   So am I   Maybe millions of people go by      Ryder:   But they      Ryder with Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe:   All disappear from view      Ryder:   And I only have eyes for you (Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe: Only have eyes)      Ryder with Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe:   I only have eyes for you.He talks about you in his sleep   And there's nothing I can do to keep   From crying when he calls your name, Jolene   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene   I'm begging of you, please don't take my man   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene   Please don't take him just because you can   Your beauty is beyond compare   With flaming locks of auburn hair   With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green   Your smile is like a breath of spring   Your voice is soft like summer rain   And I cannot compete with you, Jolene   He talks about you in his sleep   And there's nothing I can do to keep   From crying when he calls your name, Jolene   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene   I'm begging of you, please don't take my man   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene   Please don't take him just because you can   You could have your choice of men   But I could never love again   Cause he's the only one for me, Jolene   I had to have this talk with you   My happiness depends on you   And whatever you decide to do, Jolene   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene   I'm begging of you, please don't take my man   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene   Please don't take him even though you can   Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene!.Mmm..The scientists say   It'll all wash away   But we don't believe any more   Cause we've got our recruits   And our green mohair suits   So please show you ID At the door..Is your idea of heaven my idea of hell?.Yes it's rough..Each time you kissed her lips?.Lets Go!.right?.No wonder you got a headache!.High above the heavens a rainbow paints the sky..I went blind..I'm gonna live 'till I die,   Everyday of my life   I close my eyes,   And we're dreamin' together..Now you're the only thing that I can trust      All I got to do is reach out for it      All that you want   Is standing right in front of you   All that you need   Is love..I've tried in vain to find a new love   That would take your place and teach me to forget   But I find you'll always have my heart, dear   I must live in memories of regret..If you see your brother standing by the road   With a heavy load from the seeds he's sowed   And if you see your sister falling by the way   Just stop and stay you're going the wrong way      You got to try a little kindness   Yes show a little kindness   Just shine your light for everyone to see   And if you try a little kindness   Then you'll overlook the blindness   Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets      Don't walk around the down and out   Lend a helping hand instead of doubt   And the kindness that you show every day   Will help someone along their way      You got to try a little kindness   Yes show a little kindness   Just shine your light for everyone to see   And if you try a little kindness   Then you'll overlook the blindness   Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets      You got to try a little kindness   Yes show a little kindness   Just shine your light for everyone to see   And if you try a little kindness   Then you'll overlook the blindness   Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets.Oh Chariot, come and get me..Sometimes,   Gotta try,   Run and hide,   Get away from this..Do you hear me?"
"My opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and don’t concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. People ignore their parents when on computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. If they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back. Now for my third reason. Third, People wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. On the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer go out with your friends, enjoy yourself..Appetizing, young love for sale..Seems like there's always   Someone who disapproves,   They'll judge it like they know about me and you,   And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,   The jury's out,   And my choice is you..Believe me   Why don't you believe me?.Ashes to ashes and you can't bust   You so popcorn and fake industrious, yeah!.Why do you do what you do   I do what I want to do   Who said you could do what you do   I told you who told me to   I do what I want to do   I do what I want to do      Funky crime funky crime   Don't you know funk's colors blind   Well I've committed a funky crime   Against a state of mind      Hey you mister interview   I don't have to answer you   This is what I grew into   Don't judge me and my soul stew   Cause funk is my attitude   Funk is my attitude      Funky crime funky crime   Don't you know funk's colors blind   Well I've committed a funky crime   Against a state of mind      Barriers of race   In the media take place   Tellin' you there is no room   For what you do, don't budge   There's no groove to your gloom   Who made you the judge   Always room for funky tunes   And yes I funk it up      Funky boy   Meets a funky girl   Make it funky, baby   Cause the funk is crazy      Why do you do what you do   I do what I want to do   Who said you could do what you do   I told you who told me to   I do what I want to do   I do what I want to do      Funky crime funky crime   Don't you know funk's colors blind   Well I've committed a funky crime   Against a state of mind      Funky crime   Funky crime   Funky funky crime   The crime is funky.Crazy for you..I know you're afraid of me and the love of the world,   Open your eyes and you'll see that I'm singing for you..Just take me as I am, so please, have faith!.He was sittin' in the very same spot that   Otis sat to watch the dock of the bay   In the very same spot that the ships rolled in..Every morning just as soon as it's light   Get out of bed and I'm feeling alright   Make me some coffee and I sit down alone   The rest of the day I'm on the telephone   Hang up, hold on   You got a dime so you come on so strong   Save your money and let me be   Hang up the phone and quit bothering me   I got a phone in my bedroom and one in the barn   A phone in my car and one in the yard   A phone on my saddle for when I'm out on the range   A phone in my pocket for when I'm down at the grange   Hang up, hold on   You got a dime so you come on so strong   Save your money and let me be   Hang up the phone and quit bothering me   Now with devaluation all over the land   The whole wide world has got more money in their hand   They'll be calling me up from Peking and Nome   I'm going to rip out my telephone.Girls like peggy-sue, maggie-may and sheena too   Where have all the good girls gone?.(The rest of my life)   Wasn't expecting you tonight   Miss Right, how about we disappear?.Everything gets old, everyone is dumb   So I keep changing   Everything is gay, everyone is fake   So I can't hang around   Everything gets old, everyone is dumb   So I keep changing   Every word they say   Every word is fake      So I won't be around      Everything gets old, everyone is dumb   Everything gets old, everyone is dumb   Everything gets old, everyone is dumb.Live it now   Feel it now   Live it now   Forever, forever   Oh so      Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do your dance trust Me or trust again Live forever count your steps do it along push me out of the way..Baby you the whole package plus you pay your taxes   And you keep it real while them other stay plastic   You're my Wonder Women call me Mr..Well you know, I have this problem   (JP) What the heck's going on?.five hundred degrees   Shout out to the O.V.O wear rings and fatigues, ow!.And I couldn't stand looking at your face, right?.Some day   Yes   It might come   Babe      When I'll bebabe, over you..But even then I knew I'd find a much better place   Either with or without you..When 'taters need sprayin',   I bet you keep prayin'   The bugs fall off the vine   And when you fo fishin'   I bet you keep wishin'   The fish won't grab at your line."

"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benifit the society. Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information. So please make te right chose and think about what computers do for us. .Because of love, I'm a hundred feet tall   I can bounce this world like a little old ball   The heaven and earth are now all mine   I've jumped to the moon from cloud number nine   Because, because, because, because of love      Because of love, I'm a mighty big man   I hold the sun in the palm of my hand   Just one leap I can cross the seas   Jump over mountains and fly over trees   Because, because, because, because of love      Well I found love, I found love   That's all that I can say   Oh I'll never, never, I'll never, never   Never let it get away      Because of love, I'm the happiest guy   And life is sweet as cherry cream pie   Well heaven and earth are now all mine   I've jumped to the moon from cloud number nine   Because, because, because, because of love   Because, because, because, because of love.Look at Mother Nature on the run   In the nineteen seventies..(Then you close your, mind!).I know some lovers would be satisfied   With sweet ""I Love You's"" and some pretty lines   But that won't get you in this heart of mine   No you'll never steal my heart away   With just words sweet words that you say   It's all in the things that you do   I'm telling you      If you want me to believe   That I'm the only one you need   I need lovin' proof   I need lovin' proof   Baby hold me in your arms   And show me something from the heart   Give me lovin' proof   I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby      And if the love you got is strong and true   And if you love me like you say you do   Your tender touch will tell the honest truth   And your kiss can never tell a lie   'Cause I'd see it in your eyes   There's one way to ease any doubt   I tell you now      If you want me to believe   That I'm the only one you need   I need lovin' proof   Baby I won't be impressed   Unless I get some tenderness   Give me lovin' proof   I need lovin' proof from you, ooh baby      (I need lovin' proof)   If the love is right   (I need lovin' proof)   Prove it to me all night   (I need lovin' proof)   From you   'Cause you'll never steal my heart away   With just words sweet words that you say   It's all in the things that you do   I'm telling you, telling you baby.I see it in your eyes you felt the heat   There was a time when you believed   Love is the only way to make it thro'   Or be another casualty   From that heart's doin' battle on the front line   Love's got no heroes in these modern times   What love needs is a defender   I am a soldier of love..Is this blood dried upon my face?.[Chorus].Killing in the name of!.Well off we go, our guns are loaded   And so's are we   We weaves through the bushes and falls on our faces   And piss on the nice trees   And then we spot something moving an' a rustle   We pump it full of lead   And smile real wide as we hear it scream   And thud as it falls down dead      'Cause we're goin' huntin'   We're gonna kill somethin'   I don't care what it is   Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,   Maybe the neighbour's kids!.The vertigo, the need to lose.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where no information could be saved for the whole world to observe a place with no communication with loved ones or friends; or a life with no possible way of learning of catastrophe's on the other end of the earth. Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education, and stay in contact with friends and family I'm sure our world greatly benifits from this mericle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what thier astronauts saw. But computers made the expirience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered recieving some of the first footage of he moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video are released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1 states @PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We make our students come involved in technology. These are the people who progress to make the best medicine cars and computers. Our students all are benificial to our world today."" @CAPS6 settle for anything less for our childrens' education? In the middle of trajedy; faced with a difficult decision; or even just lonely, longing for someone to count on; who do you turn go first? Your loved ones they are always there for you when you need them. Now because of our access to computers whether accross the world or just the other end of the block. We will always be in contact with the ones we love. @PERSON2, my friend, found out her aunt diagnosed last year with cancer. However, she was in a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing and @CAPS7. She could even contact her doctors to see her condition after. Her aunt conquered cancer with her neice and is living happily. With only a @NUM1 chance of living, @PERSON2 gave her the support she needed through most difficult @CAPS2. Not only did see the positive effects of staying in contact. Marcos a family therapist says @NUM2 of happy families stay in contact after seperating through internet."" @CAPS8 could anyone, ever leave those who you care most about behind? @CAPS3 a world with a full education, for our children to take advantage of and a place where we can stay with each other all the time. Thats the world we we live in..Girl:   He promised us that He would be counselor   A mighty God and the Prince of Peace   He promised us that He would be a Father   And He would love us with a love

"I believe that computers are a great help to society I believe this @CAPS3 when you don'@CAPS1 know something you could go on-line to look it up. Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer. My first reason was that if you don'@CAPS1 know something you could look it up. A lot of times you could be watching @CAPS1.V. or talking with someone and you @CAPS4 wonder what something is or means. @CAPS6 instead of just letting whatever you didn'@CAPS1 know just pass on you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others to. My next reason was that if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have the time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to you door. This is a great help to the people who are to sick @CAPS3 sometimes they are @CAPS6 said they can'@CAPS1 leace there home @CAPS6 instead of starving to death they can have food or anything @CAPS7 to them if they just click a couple of buttons on the computer. Now, also this could help the people who are to busy to go to stores @CAPS3 right before they leave they could press some buttons and when they get home there stuff on sitting there for you. Back when my dad was a @CAPS2 and my mom was a vice-president of a drug producing company which sold oxy-cofin they had to have a grocery @CAPS5 ship foods to our house. They had to have this happen @CAPS3 they @CAPS4 worked long hours and they didn'@CAPS1 have the time to go to a grocery @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they had the food @CAPS7 to our house which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green right, @CAPS6 instead of cutting down more trees we can just have all that on our computer which doesn'@CAPS1 we any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society. I could come up with many more ideas but can'@CAPS1 fit them just in this story, @CAPS6 finally rember people whole lives are on their computers..[Chorus until fade].My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care,   My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you..He is cool and funkin'..If only I'd told you I love you, now all I can do is      [Chorus:]   Hold on, hold on to the feeling..Georgia Rose, Georgia Rose, don't be blue, cause you're black, Georgia Rose..[Chorus:]   Come back baby,   Yeah yeah,   Let's talk it over one more time..I'll take all the smog in California   'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,   'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines..(let me hear you!).Man: there's a guy in the tree out here..My   Dirty desire?.I know that you'll find   Someone who'll play at love   Be just your kind   Be just your kind.You're a fucking thief, you're a fucking thief, a fucking thief..I can't wait a day   I don't care what you say   Oh yeah, you got to pay   When you hit rock bottom   And you're there to stay   Sometimes late at night   I want to hold you tight   Oh no, you got to pay   Girl, you hit rock bottom   And you're there to stay   Rock bottom   Girl, you know you oughta treat me good   Rock bottom   Oh, you never treat me like you should   Hard times got me down   Good times ain't around   Now I got the mind to say   Girl, you hit rock bottom   And you're there to stay   Rock bottom   Girl, you know you oughta treat me good   Rock bottom   Yeah, you never treat me like you should   Rock bottom   Girl, you know you oughta treat me good   Rock bottom   Yeah, you never treat me like you should   Rock bottom   Rock bottom, ow.It starts off slow   With a kiss of folly   And you don't see it   As more   But after awhile   When all the dogs   See you   Sneaking   In the back door   You don't believe   When they tell you   You don't believe      Then   A world of trouble   Is all you see      Nights   When the phone rings   And it's so easy   To get up   And go back again   You don't stop   You don't think   To live without it   Knowing   That you'll never win   You don't believe   When they tell you   You don't believe      Then   A world of trouble   Is all you see      This is the last time   Or the beginning   Whenever you say   It's enough   While each day   Each month   Rolls out behind you   The lost time   Is calling your bluff   You don't believe   When they tell you   You don't believe      Then   A world of trouble   Is all you see   A world of trouble   Is all you need.Living in lies by the railway line   Pushing the hair from my eyes   Elvis is English and climbs the hills   Can't tell the bullshit from the lies   Screaming along in South London   Vicious but ready to learn   Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer   Sometimes but always in vain      [Chorus]   So I'll wait until we're sane   Wait until we're blessed and all the same   Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give   Englishman going insane   Down on my knees in suburbia   Down on myself in every way      With great expectations I change all my clothes   Mustn't grumble at silver and gold   Screaming above Central London   Never bored, so I'll never get old      [Chorus]      Day after   Day after   Day   Day after   Zane, Zane, Zane   Ouvre le chien   Day after   Day   Day after   Zane, Zane, Zane   Ouvre le chien   Day after.Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you   Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you      Can't a young nigga get money any more?.If you can see me I can see you      I could wear your new blue shoes   I should wear your old red dress   And walk to the crossroads   So take this knife   And meet me across the river      Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss   American ?.What burns and glows without flame?.Had to feel underrated,   And hated, besides..Hey, hey   You, you   I don't like your girlfriend   No way, no way      I think you need a new one   Hey, hey   You, you   I could be your girlfriend      No way, no way   Hey, hey   You, you   I know that you like me      No way, no way   No, it's not a secret   Hey, hey   You, you      I want to be your girlfriend   No way, no way   Hey, hey   You, you      I don't like your girlfriend   No way, no way   I think you need a new one      Hey, hey   You, you   I could be your girlfriend   No way, no way      Hey, hey   You, you   I know that you like me      No way, no way   No, it's not a secret   Hey, hey   You, you   I want to be your girlfriend   No way, no way   Hey, hey!.This time around...

With a computer you can also learn about places all over the @LOCATION1 and the world. With a computer everyone can learn about people all over. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere in @LOCATION2 you could learn about what those people do. Also you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1 the computer would help a lot. You can search what thet wear and what holdays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends to. if a foreign exchange person comes to your school you can search about their culture and talk to than about it. While using a computer you can also talk to people. With the use of @CAPS1 or A.I.M you can talk to your friends easily. You can ask them what homework you had if you weren't in dschool.

If you needed to do a projecct you can look up what the weather is like, and what the people do. if you wanted to help out a country that just had an earthquake or hurricane you could look up what you could do to help that country. Those three reasons are why compujters are essential to people. You can learn about different people, talk to your friends, and you can search and learn about different places arounf the world..So ya   Thought ya   Might like to   Go to the show..I Want To See   Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan   He sat in the darkness   At the edge of the road   He heard the crowd passing by   But he couldn't go   So he started crying   Like a child at the door   When they tried to quiet him   He shouted it more   Chorus:   I want to see   Free me from this darkness   Sweeping over me   I want to see   Son of David, have mercy on me   Now his heart was trembling   Could this really be true?.I know you better than I know myself..Master!.I float high,   Goodbye,   I will miss y'all..All the big fools in town got together   Every hopeless lovin' heart I know was there   We all sat around and told our own best story   Then they made me the big fool of the year..Mary nodded pa-rum pum pum pum   The Ox and Lamb kept time pa-rum pum pum pum   I played my drum for Him pa-rum pum pum pum   I played my best for Him pa -rum pum pum pum   Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum   Then He smiled at me pa-rum pum pum pum   Me and my drum.But who is saved?.Left arm gone clean up to the elbow      Just about 45 minutes   southeast of Tipidow, Louisiana   There lived a man called Duck Bill Sam   and his pretty wife Hannah   They raised up a son that could   eat up his weight in groceries   Named him after a man of the cloth..(x2)      Sucka!.Try your best to see through the confusion   Seems the more you see   The less you try   You don't know what's real and what's illusion   If you don't know by now then how should I?.Rooster:   I'll give you one gues      Rooster, Hannigan, and Lily:   Yes!.Come on Moe's bar, what'll ya eat, beat or drink?.I see the morning sun   Coming over the hill,   Sorrow and pain for me   Coming over the hill..Waiting for your knock, dear   On my old front door..Take me to a place where I don't care,   This is me and my liquor store blues..Salute the ones who died   The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice   All the things we love   Like our chicken fried      And cold beer on a Friday night   A pair of jeans that fit just right   And the radio up   I like to see the sunrise   See the love in my woman's eyes   Feel the touch of a precious child   And know a mother's love      Getcha a little chicken fried   And cold beer on a Friday night   A pair of jeans that fit just right   And the radio up   I like to see the sunrise   See the love in my woman's eyes   Feel the touch of my precious child   And know a mother's love.Hold me..Into the sleep machine I won't plug in,   In fact I'd rather die before I will comply..Same words different meaning   Same heart different feeling,   So much for him so much for her 'cause that's past,   Now I know about that someone else's heart..Why don't we stop fooling ourselves?"
"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know a lot of people now a days are constintly on the computer, and many people think it’s a problem. Well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such @CAPS1 learning, entertainment, and even weight. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do. The computer can help you get in contact with realitives you haven't seen in a long time. Or maybe if you have been having some health problems you can go online to see what is wrong, I remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick, and her doctor told her everything was fine, but in wasen't. So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease, and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and her on a medicine. In my opinion the computer was on of the best inventions made. It can be used for so many things, you can also purchase items over the computer. So now I hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computer's..And if there's one thing we all need now,   It's a rhythm to live by, a rhythm of hope..S she - Tell me   Now she?.Who's gonna tell a fool?.The power of gold      You're a creature of habit, run like a rabbit   Scared of a fear you can't name   You own paranoia is looming before you   But nobody thinks that it's a game      Balance the cost of the soul you lost   With the dreams you lightly sold   Then tell me that you're free of the power of gold   The power of gold      The women are lovely, the wine is superb   But there's something about the song that disturbs you.If you could be anyone that you wanted to be   With anyone that you wanted to be with   Doing anything that you wanted to do,   What would it be and who would be with you?.Berdarahkan tuan yang duduk di belakang meja   Atau cukup hanya ucapkan belasungkawa aku bosan   Lalu terangkat semua beban dipundak   Semudah itukah luka-luka terobati..Johnny made a mistake and took his knife down to school one day..And everyone will shine,   Truth is yours and mine,   Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh   We'll taste, the kiss of freedom,   It calls our name..Tonight      [Chorus:]   If the darkness falls, and my angel calls   In my despair (In my despair)   Will you be there?.I'm giving, giving you, the choke hold,   My flirting with disaster is mighty loved..The joy of a toy   Got the look of a lie..Things went down we don't understand,   But I think in time we will..""I'm the one who can please you""   Ain't that what you said   You seemed so alone   I guess I was easily led      I showed you my love   But I guess that it went to your head   When you were hungry   I brought you your breakfast in bed      Even it up, even it up, even it up   Even it up, even it up, even it up   A good man pays his debt   But you ain't paid yours yet   Even it   Even it up      I took you down over the tracks when   You wanted some sin   I brought you satin and herbs from   The places I been   Now something tells me you're   Going to use me again   You think you can lay down the how and   The where and the when      Even it up, even it up, even it up   Even it up, even it up, even it up   I don't want to bum it all   But this ax she got to fall   Even it   Even it up.(Tell me what you see) The peak of the Holiday Season   (Everythings alright with me) Bringin in the New Year      Everybody parties on a New Year's Eve   Waitin' for the countdown   Everybody lookin at the big tv, talkin' at the same time   Bongin smokes, telling jokes, standin' in the punchline   Everybody parties in the new years eve gonna have a good time (X's 2)      (Tell me what you see)Bringin' in a New Year   (Everything's alright with me)Party on New Years Eve!.There's wonderful power in the blood   Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?.Glory Lord Jesus,   Your blood has removed my shame..Incidentally,   If you should run into a shower,   Well step inside my cottage door,   And meet the million dollar baby   From the five and ten cent store      Love comes along like a popular song   Anytime or anywhere at all,   Rain or sunshine,   Spring or fall..Please tell me what is taking place,   Cause I can't seem to find a trace..And I said oh, whoa, whoa, hon   It ain't fair, it ain't fair, hon what you do,   I say baby what you're doin' to me, no, no, no, no, no, no..(Madonna:)   Pride's that splendid liar   Sworn enemy of love      (Jennifer:)   Kept my lips from saying   Things my heart was thinking of      (Madonna:)   But now my pride you've humbled   I've cast it to the winds      (Jennifer:)   Broken, beaten, sick at heart      (Both:)   Our compassion begins      (Madonna:)   We played the game of 'stay away'   But it costs more than I can pay   Without you I can't make my way   I surrender dear      (Jennifer:)   I may seem proud, I may act gay   It's just a pose, I'm not that way   'Cause deep down in my heart I say   I surrender dear      (Madonna:)   Little mean things we were doing   Must have been part of the game   Lending a spice to the wooing      (Both:)   But I don't care who's to blame      (Madonna:)   When stars appear   (Jennifer:)   When stars appear   (Madonna:)   And shadows fall   (Jennifer:)   And shadows fall   (Madonna:)   Why then you'll hear   (Jennifer:)   Why then you'll hear   (Both:)   My poor heart call   To you my love, my life, my all   I surrender dear.Do you love me?"
"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you see, owning a computer can effect you. Having a computer can make you have lazy behavier, can @CAPS2 you from being indoors, and can @CAPS2 you inside so you dont hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. When your lazy or becoming lazy you dont want to do anything, and without doing anything you can become overweight. So, you need exersize because it's good for you and exersizing can protect you from health problems such @CAPS1 diebities. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses. Being so drawn to your computer can @CAPS2 you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for atleast an hour a day you'll see fore sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 you from what realy matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are realy important and if you don't spend time with them they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so dont spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun, I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, @CAPS2 you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least a hour a day they'll live a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer get off your couch, and enjoy your life..Don't give up..Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer   You hear that?.Well, I'm a jitterbug boy, by the shoe-shine   Resting on my laurels and my hardys too   Life of Riley on a swing shift, gears follow my drift   Once upon a time I was in show-biz too   I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers playing at Ebbets Field   Seen the Kentucky Derby too   It's fast women, slow horses, unreliable sources,   And I'm holding up the lamp-post if you want to know   I've seen the Wabash Cannonball, buddy, I've done it all   Cause I slept with the lions and Marilyn Monroe,   Had breakfast in the eye of a hurricane   Fought Rocky Marciano, played Minnesota Fats,   Burned hundred-dollar bills, I've eaten Mulligan stew   Got drunk with Louis Armstrong, what's that old song?.If you think I'm uncool   Playin' the part of the fool   'Cause I love Him!.I ain't the kind of woman   Who'd make your life a bed of ease, ha ha ha ha!.People talkin' but they just don't know,   What's in my heart, and why I love you so..All of my memories keep you near..Everybody's dying,   They're all trying to feel it, I know they are..Ki ni naru noni kikenai   Oyogitsukarete kimi made mukuchi ni naru   Aitai noni mienai nami ni osarete   Mata sukoshi tooku naru   Togirenai you ni Keep it going baby   Onaji kimochi ja nai nara tell me   Muri wa shinai shugi demo   Sukoshi nara shite mitemo ii yo   I wanna be with you now   Futari de distance chijimete   Ima nara maniau kara   We can start over   Hitotsu ni wa narenai   I wanna be with you now   Itsu no hi ka distance mo   Dakishimerareru you ni nareru yo   We can start sooner   Yappari I wanna be with you   Hitokoto de konna ni mo kizutsuku kimi wa   Kodoku wo oshiete kureru   Mamorenai toki keep on trying, baby   Yakusoku toori ja nai kedo trust me   Muri wa shinai shugi demo   Kimi to narashite mitemo ii yo   I wanna be with you now   Futari de distance mitsumete   Ima nara maniau kara   We can start over   Kotoba de tsutaetai   I wanna be with you now   Sono uchi ni distance mo   Dakishimerareru you ni nareru yo   We should stay together   Yappari I need to be with you.And the horizon opens wide..I stay away from you too much..This must be heaven, tonight I cross the line   You must be the angel, I though I might never find   Was it you I heard singing, oh, while I was chasin' dreams   Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around   And the rain fallin' down but I never know   Got to be heaven 'cause here's where the rainbow ends   If this ain't the real thing, then it's close enough to pretend   When that wind blows when the night's about to fall   You can hear the silence call, it's a certain sort of sound   Like the rain fallin' down   Hole's in what's left of my reason, hole's in the knees of my blues   Odds against me been increasin' but I'll pull through   I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do   But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine   I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose   Never know now, just don't never know, no   Well it's been heaven but even the rainbows will end   Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'   And I'm as good as gone again   I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance   Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance   And the rain fallin' down, well, you never know, just don't know   Listen, sure don't know what I going for, but I'm gonna go for it for sure.Let's go up the, up the, up the ladder to heaven..Standin' up or layin' down,   My head goes spinnin' round and round again..Ain't a cardinal sin, baby lemme in, girl I'm gonna treat you right   Well goodness sakes, my snake's alive and it's ready to bite   Hornet's nest, lay me down to rest, ooh I wanna shed my skin   I got the urge to merge, you're cold as ice, baby won't you lemme in   Night scenes, wet dreams, enough to make you drool   And fire, fire, fire for the fuel      Don't like to dress, talk too good, but I found my queen   Not too clean, know what I like, if you know what I mean      Baby, baby, guess you win the prize   Maybe, baby, where the sun never shines      This must be love, fits like a glove   Well it must be love, it must be love -

"Technology has been growing and changing rapidly. Just look at apples new @CAPS1, a desent rized touch screen computer. Computers have been rapidly changing too. But I think that @CAPS2 need to cut down on the use of electronics. Being one the computer for a long time and large amount of time can damage your eyesight, give you arthrightus and takes time @CAPS5 of exersizing; one of the thing manhy @CAPS2 need to do. Many @CAPS2 have been spending has too long on the computer, although it can be very useful it can also be very damaging to your eyesight many people spent large amounts of time staring at the computer screen. If you stair at something for too long it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because your trying @CAPS5 your eye lens. Also the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes. The light coming on to your eyes is like staring at the sun but not quit as damaging. The sun will instatntly damage your eyes while overtime a computer slowly damges your eyesight. If your eyesight is already damaged a computer will worsen it. The more time spent on a computer the more you damage your vision. Since your eyes are already bad you might think ""well they can't get any worse."" @CAPS5 the truth is they can not only is the light and the amount of time spent during a being onthe computer damaging to people with @NUM1 vision but even more damaging to people without. can be genetic or common to people who constently their knuckles. It can also be common to people who spend exeessive amount of time on the computer. AIM is very popular to people of all ages. Its a way to instantly gossip or chat with freinds. But it takes alot of typing. Typing to long or to much can cause your fingers to lock up and it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain. if this constenity happens to you you could be a canidat for arthrightus. No letting your fingers take a break can also be one of the reasons your fingers hurt, if you never let them take a break they can also lock up and it can be very painful. You should spend less time on the computer if you don't want artrightus. Because of all this new technology less @CAPS2 go outside and play or hit the gym and exersize. That @MONTH1 be way many @CAPS2 are over weight. Being on the computer for to long takes away time you could use to exersize or get some fresh air..But then she knows it's like a curse   To find our chosen roles reversed   To unify my universe   To call me mellow      If only I was half my age and she was older   We'd live on ice-cream on Coney Island   I though it's gravity that drags down my balloon   She stays in orbit way after midnight      Woah slip and slide   Does she go all dewey-eyed?.See the marketplace in old Algiers   Send me photographs and souvenirs   But just remember when a dream appears   You belong to me..Now I know why   I've found the answer for myself   What a day it would be to share   To share your love      Can't think   Why I never thought   Of this before, now I know   What it means to me   To share, share all my love with you,   To share, share all my love with you..All night long they'd chatter away,   All day long there were happy and gay,   Swinging and singing in their hunky-tonkey way..It's too late, it's too late now,   To pry away, to pry away..You've got her in your pocket   And there is no way out now   Put it in the safe and lock it   Cause it's home sweet home      Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way   To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way   And you'll be there if she ever feels blue   And you'll be there when she finds someone new   What to do   Well you know      You keep her in your pocket   Where there's no way out now   Put it in the safe and lock it   Cause it's home sweet home      The smile on your face made her   Think   She had the right one   Then she thought she was sure   By the way you two could have fun   But now you're scared   You think she's running away   You search in you hand for something clever to say   Don't go away   Cause I want      To keep you in my pocket   Where there's no way out now   Put it in the safe and lock it   Cause it's home sweet home      And in your own mind   You know you're lucky just to know her   And in the beginning all you wanted   Was to show her   But now she might leave   Like she's threatened before   Grab hold of her fast   Before her feet leave the floor   And she's out the door   Cause you want      To keep her in your pocket.Every day this goes on around here!.Blind infatuations, the means to an end..He don't drive no Cadillac..Aggravation, fuelin' me,   Money powered, hypocrisy..Under the sun   There's nothing to hide   Under the moon   A stranger waits inside   People disappear   The music fades away   Splashing through the rain   I'll dream with them one day      It's raining, raining   On the streets of New York City   It's raining, raining   Raining deep in heaven      I may have wasted all those years   They're not worth their time in tears   I may have spent too long in darkness   In the warmth of my fears      Take a look at yourself   Not at anyone else   And tell me what you see      I know the air is cold   I know the streets are cruel   But I'll enjoy the ride today      It's raining, raining   On the streets of New York City   It's raining, raining   Raining deep in heaven   Raining deep in heaven      I may have wasted all those years   They're not worth their time in tears   I may have spent too long in darkness   In the warmth of my fears   And as I walk through all my myths   Rising and sinking like the waves   With my thoughts wrapped around me   Through a trial of tears      Hidden by disguise   Stumbling in a world   Feeling uninspired   He gets into his car   Not within his eyes to see   Open up, open up   Not much better than the man you hate      Still awake   I continue to move along   Cultivating my own nonsense   Welcome to the wasteland   Where you'll find ashes   Nothing but ashes   Still awake   Bringing change   Bringing movement, bringing life   A silent prayer   Thrown away   Disappearing in the air   Rising   Sinking   Raining deep inside me   Nowhere to turn   I look for a way back home      It's raining, raining   Raining deep in heaven   It's raining, raining   Raining deep in heaven   It's raining, raining   Raining deep in heaven   It's raining, raining   Raining deep in heaven.Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,   I hope you never see me wind up   What is wrong with this animal?.[Chorus:]   Why don't you wake up   And stop what you're doing right now?.The sweetest thing I've ever known   Was like the kiss on the collarbone   Soft caress of happiness   The way you walk your style of dress   I wish I didn't get so weak   Ooo baby just to hear you speak   Makes me argue just to see   How much you're in love with me   See like a queen a queen upon her throne      [Chorus]   It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know   It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know      I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)   So I tell you leave, when I mean stay   Warm as the sun dipped in black   Fingertips on the small of my back   More valuable than all I own   Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone      [Chorus]      It was the, ah   I tried to explain   Ah, but baby, it's in vain      Speaking on my mother's phone   The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)   Sweet prince of the ghetto   Your kisses taste like amaretto   Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating   How sad, how sad that all things come to an end   But then again, I'm, I'm not alone      [Chorus].Mobil station where I stand   This old gas pump in my hand   My boss don't like me, got a face like a weasel   Oil on my hands and the smell of diesel   Here comes a big shot from the city   V8 engine, she runs so pretty   'Fill her up son, unleaded   I need a full tank of gas where I'm headed'   Up in the front seat a pretty red head   'We're going to Vegas we're gonna

walked into a glade of heaven   And there's music playing   This money is cold in my hand   And a voice somewhere is saying   'Why would you wanna take that stolen thing   And what real happiness can

"Dear, @CAPS1 paper @CAPS2 The computers we have do benefits our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter.You could go on diffrent websites to help you learn what your stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called a @ORGANIZATION1. It goes over on waht you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's @NUM1 @NUM1/2 years old. Isn't that amazing on that computers can do. Next I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you @MONTH1 know. When you have computers you could talk to people that live across the @LOCATION1 woudn't you want to talk to somebody long distance without paying extra money on your cell-phone? I remember one time I was talking to my dad cause I had no minuts on my phone and it went great talking to him on the computer. Having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone. You could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about @PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name and his biography came so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts you could type up papers and look up diffrent things you had to do in class. Would you want to write a @NUM3 page essay and makin your fingers cramp up just writing no. so you just go on the computer and type it up without cramping your fingers @CAPS3 reconsider your opinion, cause computers can get you smarter, talk far away people and help you with homework..Won't you come home Bill Bailey, won't you come home?.Next Sunday, darling is my birthday   A day that should be free from care   Best wishes and congratulations   But only sorrow fills the air      While friends are singing happy birthday   There'll be smile upon my face   But when they're gone, the smile will vanish   A broken heart will take it's place      Another year has come and gone now   The plans I made have gone a stray   The day that should be filled with laughter   Will only be another day      The little house we planned together   Is empty now without you dear   But in my dreams you're there beside me   So let me dream that you are here.No no   Its all good with me   Their ain't nothing you can't do now      If you want to grove now,   This is where's the party's at   Gotta make you move now,   This is where's the party's at   Everybody gettin in the zone,   This is where's the party's at   Everybody come on..This is a story 'bout livin'   A tale of a long hard road   Ain't a whole lot of misgivin's   Of the things that I thought I sowed   My daddy was a real hard worker   He said son there will come a day   Talk ain't always cheap   And here's what daddy had to say   With these hands I've made my livin'   With these hands I've held a child   With these hands I've climbed a mountain   Sometimes we forget   We ain't much different at all      He likes grits, you like the apple   There ain't nothin' wrong with that   He says y'all, you say you's   It all depends on where you're at   Well a little bit of music is a whole lot of fun   And its always good for the soul   From New York City out to California   You know its only rock and roll      With these hands we come together   With these hands we can change the world   With these hands I play my music   Sometimes we forget   We ain't much different at all      Oh, not at all   So what I'm trying to tell you   Is that I'm only one son of the south   Its gonna take more than you me and you   To work this whole thing out      With these hands I've made my livin'   With these hands I've held a child   With these hands I've climbed a mountain   Sometimes we forget      With these hands we come together   With these hands we can change the world   With these hands I play my music   Sometimes we forget   We ain't much different   We ain't much different   Ain't much different   At all.As you pass them by   They whisper their remarks one to another,   And you give them the eye   Even though you know that you could be their mother..Feuilly, Combeferre, our time is running short..Would it be enough   if each of us would give our love?.(i think you should)   Is your conscience all right

answer's no we had more statues than you've had hot dinners   Our games meant truce was called in war a peace every 4 years   But wrestling was so violent that bouts could end in tears   No girls allowed to watch or run that might sound rude   But makes sense when I tell you we competed nude      [Chorus]   FLAME   It's gonna burn forever   Love for Olympic heroes   FLAME   We'd like one next however   Sadly it's Emperor Nero   Hey watch it you two, alright      [Verse 2]   Emperor Nero:   I went from Rome to Greece so I could play them at their games   In 67AD you know I won Olympic fame   Told them to include a contest based on poetry   Not much good for sportsmen no, but brilliant for me   Crashed my racing chariot but still awarded gold   Hey my Olympics my rules   To argue would be bold   I won every medal that was up for grabs   The crowd loved it well they had to or I would have had them stabbed, OK?.Love for life   Such noble words for noble minds   Show me a love for life   Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive   When I'll feel alive   I'll be waiting for that day      Once I had a friend that I could count   Times of need are not enough   Once I found a love I had to know   Now we might know each other just too well   Once I saw a dream I had to chase   Dreams quickly turn to reality   Now let me close my eyes   Because I don't want to see anything anymore.A white house, a white room   The program of today   Lights on, switch on   Your eyes are far away   The map represents you   And the tape is your voice   Follow all along you   Till you recognize the choice      I take pictures   Photographic pictures      Bright light   Dark room   Bright light   Dark room      I said I'd write a letter   But I never got the time   And I'm looking to the day   I mesmerize the light      The years I spend just thinking   Of a moment we both knew   A second boss looking into   It seems it can't be true.[Chorus:]   Oh, won't you stay with me?.And she in between, the victim of sound,   Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows..One red morning   With no warning   Life comes crashing in   To wake you early with its golden din..Come with me, come with me   And we shall run across the sky..Its bed time..I saw him dancing there   By the record machine   I knew he must have   Been about seventeen      The beat was going strong   Playing my favorite song   I could tell   It wouldn't be long      'Til he was with me   Yeah, with me   And I could tell   It wouldn't be long      'Til he was with me   Yeah, with me      Singin'   I love rock 'n' roll   So put another dime   In the jukebox      Baby   I love rock 'n' roll   So come and   Take the time   And dance with me      Ow   He smiled, so I got up   And asked for his name   ""But that don't matter,"" he said      ""'Cause it's all the same."".The minute you pulled me through   You thought that then you knew   If not today, I'd find a way   To get to you      Just a little of nothin'   That's all you had the time to give   Just a little of nothin'   Ain't gonna make it worthwhile for me      If you'd only have listened   You'd have heard every word I said   Just a little

"Dear Newspaper; I bileve that computers are good for our society. There are maney resons as to why I beleve this. One reson is that it makes life easior, it also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers how would we talk with people without phones and spred news. Computers make life easior by maney ways. For example, if you needed a docters permition to play a sport, it would be alot easior to send him/her an email telling him/her to send you can email saying you can you can show it to the sports team and they will alow you to play. We can also lirn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and go to a news website and look at the wether so we can make plans for the day. We can find the newest technology ""I phone"" or ""@CAPS1 "". There are some people in the world that don't but have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the airfore and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't alow phones. Also if there is a pirson with good news and they want tell a lot of people send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I beleve computers are a good thing to have in new society. I have that they make life easyor. It also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world. I hope you agree on my topic..Picking up something good   Hey, radio head!.(Chorus)   'Cause I feel like a child again,   And you are my best friend..Five o'clock in the morning   You ain't home   I can't help thinking that's strange   Baby I just want you to know   I won't go through it again   Yes, those clouds are closing in      And I will not accept this as a part of my life   I will not live in fear   Of what may be   And the lessons I have learned   I would rather be alone than watch you   Spinning that wheel for me      You've got a thing about danger   Ain't you getting what you want from me   You've got a thing about strangers   Baby that's what we used to be   You've got a thing about danger baby   I guess the hungry just can't see   One of these days   You're gonna bring some home to me      Six o'clock in the morning   You ain't home   I can't help thinking that's strange   It seems that everybody takes their chances   These days   Oh yeah we're standing in the rain      And I will not accept this as part of my life      How can you love me   When you are playing with my life   You say give me time and I'll do better I swear   Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair   And I don't want to go back there.Thirty five dolla bidja now forty doller forty, wouldja megga forty bidya on a   Forty doller forty doller wouldja gimme forty, wouldja gimme forty dollar bill?.Burning down the house..Lemme hear ya flow sistas      [Pink and Christina:]   Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, flow sister   Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister      [Mya:]   He met Marmalade down in old Moulin Rouge   Strutting her stuff on the street   She said, hello, hey Joe   You wanna give it a go, oh      [All]   Gitchi gitchi ya ya da da (hey hey hey)   Gitchi gitchi ya ya hee (hee oh)   Mocca chocolata ya ya (ooh yeah)   Creole Lady Marmalade (ohh)   Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir (oh oh)   Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (yeah yeah yeah yeah)      [Pink:]   He sat in her boudoir while she freshened up   Boy drank all that magnolia wine   On her black satin sheets   Is where he started to freak, yeah   Gitchi gitchi ya ya da da (da da yeah)   Gitchi gitchi ya ya hee (ooh yeah yeah)   Mocca chocolata ya ya   Creole Lady Marmalade, uh      [Chorus]   Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir (ce soir)   Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ooh)      [Lil' Kim:]   Yeah, yeah, aw   We come through with the money and the garter belts   Let 'em know we 'bout that cake, straight out the gate   We independent women, some mistake us for whores   I'm saying, why spend mine when I can spend yours?.I feel like my fun has just begun   Together we will raise this roof and party   And have a good time   Have a good time, yeah   All we need is some funky music, yeah   So we can play the part and get way down   Into some rhythm we can groove to   Everybody have a good time      (repeat to fade).(We love them)      Oh, oh      Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers   Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers   I like you a lot lot, think you're really hot hot   Let's go to the party heard our buddy's the DJ   Don't forget my lipstick I left it in your ashtray   I like you a lot lot, all we want is hot hot      [Chorus: x2]      I'm not loose, I like to party   Let's get lost in your Ferrari   Not psychotic or dramatic   I like boys and that is that   Love it when you call me legs   In the morning buy me eggs   Watch your heart when we're together   Boys like you love me forever      Oh, oh, oh, oh      [Chorus: x3].So I take what is mine, and hold what is mine,   suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine..Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana....Left behind..I'll Walk with God from this day on..Summer was gone and the heat died down   And Autumn reached for her golden crown   I looked behind as I heard a sigh   But this was the time of no reply..The diamond jack   Black magical lady luck,   Who will show me the way..When Jesus comes he comes in power (echo)   He pours down his spirit like a shower (echo)   Repeat      Chorus   O you give us freedom and joy in your presence Lord   In your presence we're free   O let us shout and dance and lift up our habds and sing cause we are free   And He loves to come a fill me up   He loves to overflow my cup   He loves to come and bring his touch to my heart      He turns my mourning into dancing (echo)   He turns my weeping into laughing (echo)   repeat      chorus 2x.You're telling ev'ry one I know   I'm on your mind each place we go   They can't believe that you're in love with me..Wow!.And when I find you, I'm gonna get your lovin' arms today..Written by John Curulewski   Lead vocals by John Curulewski      Did you ever in your life before   feel as bad as this?.Softly and tenderly   Jesus is calling   Calling for you and for me   See on the portals   He's waiting and watching   Watching for you and for me..Hello, Hello, Hello   Is anyone home?"
"@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has developed majorly these past decades. It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long. Online for the games make it even more fun thus it make them lazier. There are so many games for the computer it's horrible says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION3. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true..Couldn't keep a secret   Got a concrete skull   Couldn't shut up   You're an imbecile   You're an ugly dog   There's nothing to gain   You couldn't shut up   Got a bad bad brain      Couldn't hold your tongue   You were just too young   Like a two year old   You told you told   You are all the same jelly   Bean brain   Every one's a secret nerd..I've done all of the old ones..Face to face .....Kill we will kill death,   Masturbating on the deeds we have done,   Hell commands death kill,   Argue not of feel the death of sun,   Burning lives burning,   Asking me for the mercy of god,   Ancient cries crying,   Acting fast upon the way of the dog,      Welcome to hell,   Welcome to hell,   Welcome to hell,   Welcome to hell..It's crazy, crazy, little man,   You've got yourself entangled..You can never go home any more..Where ya going with that mask I found?.(Earl King)      Do re me fa so la ti   This little creature was a-passing me   He got a whole lot of rhythm when he walks   And I can hear music, baby, when he talks   Do re mi fa so la ti   Forget about the dough and think about me, oh yeah      Do re mi fa so la ti   I wonder who can this creature be?.Though it worries me to say   That I never felt this way      I don't know what I'm up against?.When the sky that we look upon tumble and falls   And the mountains crumble to the sea   I won't cry, I won't cry   No I won't shed a tear,   Just as long as you stand   Stand by me..Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:   ""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep   The wrong shall fail, the right prevail   In peace on earth, good will to men..Hey babe, can I count on you   To see me through?.All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,   It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it..Go tell my baby sister   Don't do what I have done..Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep   When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep..So maybe I took a little too much..What days and nights though   Rocking out of ham yard   Oh skip that fandango   Bring the blues back down hard   Though chuck would never admit it   At the door of the jail   There stood Guy Stevens   And he was waving the bail..The fire is burning   The room's all aglow   Outside the December wind blows   Away in the distance the carolers sing in the snow   Everybody's laughing   The world is celebrating   And everyone's so happy   Except for me tonight      Because I miss you   Most at Christmas time   And I can't get you   Get you off my mind   Every other season comes along   And I'm all right   But then I miss you, most at Christmas time      I gaze out the window   This cold winter's night   At all of the twinkling lights   Alone in the darkness   Remembering when you were mine   Everybody's smiling   The whole world is rejoicing   And everyone's embracing   Except for you and I      Baby I miss you   Most at Christmas time   And I can't get you   Get you off my mind   Every other season comes along   And I'm all right   But then I miss you, most at Christmas time      In the springtime those memories start to fade   With the April rain   Through the summer days   Till autumn's leaves are gone   I get by without you   Till the snow begins to fall      And then I miss you   Most at Christmas time   And I can't get you   Get you off my mind   Every other season comes along   And I'm all right....It sounded like they stole it from like the ""I Love Lucy"" show..Won't you do the same?.He's always see you through   And this trouble ever troubles you   Well don't you run and hide   'Cause if you ever need a friend   He'll be there by your side   If you talk to the man upstairs"
"Dear @CAPS1, I thick this is a good idea because you can play games and talk to family or frends and lisen to music. My first reason is playing games. When you are bored and theres nothing to do all you can do is go on the computer and play all kinds of games like cars, shoting, arcade games to. You can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer. My seacond reason is talking to freinds or famiely. If your brother or sister or any of your family members live in a different state and you want to talk to them or see them then all you got to do is ask them ""@CAPS2 is your email address and then if they got a myspace or facebook then you could talk to them as long as you want. You can also talk to your friends on those websites to. My thied reason is lisening to music.

"What is more fun, stairing at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beutifull nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family? And always remember what the is..Hey hey,the clouds are whey,   There's straw for the donkeys   And the innocents can all sleep safely   All sleep safely..Maybe you cannot speak for shame   Or has your brain been idle too   And now it will not think for you?'.Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope it's gonna get better   Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me everything's gonna come

someone will listen to you, to me, someone's gonna see      If it's gonna get better, it starts with a feeling   If it's gonna get better, it's gonna take time   If it's gonna get better, we've gotta

"Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?.Will everybody slip?.He's a model citizen   Just keep

"How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers..I've got something you can never eat..When I found out   If I took it as the truth   Could there be another meaning here?.Who left a poem down the hall?.And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be   Yours this time, I'm gonna teach you to trust   And learn how to burn,   Experience pearls   Pearls of experience   When sand strikes up in your eyes   I will cover your face..I'll plant your desert with roses,   And I'm gonna keep, keep them for you..Do you really think I care   What you eat or what you wear   Won't you join together with the band   There's a million ways to laugh   Ev'ry one's a path   Won't you join together with the band..I had a girl (had a girl)   In Waycross, Georgia (Waycross, Georgia) but she had unfaithful ways   Made me feel (made me feel) I was unwanted (so unwanted)   Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave..Got to get this devil off my back..Mrs. Potts      There may be something there that wasn't there before      Chip      What's there, Mama?.[Chorus]   Well I'm tracing your face up in the space of the bottom bunk,   Oh Cordova..""Why don't nobody sing of romance?.Let's run baby through these city streets   We're all victims of captivity   Let's stop the madness without any tricks   I'll whisper bible quotes and you can read my lips      Let's get back to the fundamental things   Let's get back to the elements of style   Let's get back to where it all began   Let's get back to the fundamental things      Let's dance barefoot over broken glass   Slither like a snake does through the wet cold grass   Howl and tremble in a sleepless grind   Let's do the brain drain and leave it all behind      Let's get back to the fundamental things   Let's get back to the elements of style   Let's get back to where it all began   Let's get back to the fundamental things      You can sit in your room and worry   You can contemplate the end   Or let your house burn down behind you   Run with me through the streets again      Let's get back, I wanna go back   Let's get back, let's get back      Let's get back to the fundamental things   Let's get back to the elements of style   Let's get back to where it all began   Let's get back to the fundamental things      You can hide out on your rooftop   Wishing you had never been   Or go down to Hal's Bar and Grill   And find your innocence again      Let's get back, let's get back   Let's get back, I wanna go back   I've got to go back.How the hell can a person go to work in the morning   And come home in the evening and have nothing to say..This land full of people bent on gettin' their kicks lord, lord..It's in the way you're always hiding from the light..The cops are well-groomed, with   Muscled physiques in butt town   Their tan uniforms are tailored in chic   In butt town   Any young black male who walks down the street   Is gonna get stopped by a car full of meat   But the girl with the hair   Flies by in her underwear-      She's done nothing so far to deserve that car   When you live in butt town   You gotta get down   But in butt town I'm learnin'   In butt town I'm earnin'   In butt town I'm turnin'   Into my worst nightmare      I'm tellin' you, it's a motley crew in butt town   Monday you're new, and Friday you're through   In butt town   The producer is wily, and owns what he sells   The talent is eager to go straight to hell   Th tits are amazing, and everyone's gazing   At some body part-   That's the nature of art in butt town      All over butt town dreams have a show down   All over butt town values are thrown down   But in butt town I'm learnin'   In butt town I'm earnin'   In butt town I'm turnin'   Into my worst nightmare      In butt town baby   I'm gonna be a star   I'm gonna shake my butt far   Now here we go   I'm gonna shake my butt   Shake my butt shake my butt   In butt town.Invasion..A man once said love is all you need   And if not right he was close indeed   It won't pay the rent   Won't buy your shoes   But it's time well spent if it keeps away the blues   It won't turn the tide or stop the rain   And deep down inside there might be a little pain   But you still go through it   'Cause it gets you through the night   'Cause when you get down to it love is all right      Love is all right   Love is all right   Oh, love is all right      When your girl walks out you just want her back   You got to have her now and that's a fact Jack   'Cause as big and bad and mean as you are   You can't watch you're woman in another man's car   You want to keep that girl in you're passenger seat   You want to find her groove, want to keep her beat   So if you have to do it, you're ready to fight   'Cause when you get down to it love is all right.Is that what I want?.But take your time, think a lot,   Why, think of everything you've got..Oh!"
"Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds. Also, in todays world, waiting is almost non-existant. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things a lot this world is that we're all different, connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society. Conneticing through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us. But don't be fooled. It can also befor pleasure, say @CAPS3'son & buissness trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and steathily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is maraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be were we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research to day, than estatic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have kemotherapy. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analize research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life exsentency, and who doesn't want you've larger's some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why don't you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's advention, connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end..The frivolous rap song he rap about   Is no good..Than that thought you know I'm considering..Hurry, hurry, step right up!.So before you think that you're too lost to save,   Remember there is nothing greater than grace..A hundred years in the sunshine   Hasn't taught me all there is to know..[Verse -

"Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with. You can find plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies. you can find dates on the computer, too and find information about certain eople too..So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution,   This melody inside of me still searches for solution,   A twist of fate, a change of heart,   Kills my infatuation,   A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,      No one ever told me when I was alone,   They just thought I'd know better, better..What if all you understand,   Could fit into the center of our hand,   Then you found it wasn't you,   Who held the sum of everything you knew,      We're insane but not alone,   You hold on,   And their gone      Like the sun we will live to rise,   Like the sun we will live and die,   And then ignite again,   Like the sun we will live to rise, (Oh yeah)   What if the one thing that I missed,   Was everything I need to pass the test,   And if I fail what happens then,   Can I still count on you as a friend      We're insane but not alone,   You hold on,   And their gone      Like the sun we will live to rise,   Like the sun we will live and die,   And then ignite again,   Like the sun we will live to rise   (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)      Like the sun we will live to rise,   Like the sun we will live and die,   And then ignite again      Like the sun we will live to rise,   Like the sun we will live and die,   And then ignite again,   Like the sun we will live to rise,   (Oh yeah, oh yeah).103, 4, and 5, it get to hot to stay alive..I see a Black Moon rising,   And it's calling out my name..Let the world stop turning..Cold water fright   It's a junkie slip   And an old spoon cooky cooky cooky kooky afternoon   All afternoon and in the middle of the night      You're worse for the difference and it don't sleep tight   Don't pull the curtains fon't put on the light   See-see-see-'cause it's a junkie slip!.I must be going home..Eight miles high   And when you touch down   You find you're   Stranger than known   Signs in the street   That say where you're going   Are somewhere      Just being their own   Nowhere is there   Warmth to be found   Just those afraid   Of losing their ground   Rain gray town   Known for its sound   In places      Small faces abound   Round the squares   Huddled in storms   Some laughing   Some just shapeless forms   Sidewalk scenes   And black limousines   Some living   Some standing   Alone.But it takes more than that to bring me down, down, down..I really love you, I really need you   I'll always love you....Everything's different   But nothing has changed   Are we going in circles   It's Christmas again   Can't you hear the sleigh bells right?.Yeah, I'ma a need a designated driver for this one   It's the Bugatti tonight, strong arm, J.

"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computer are entertaning. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play videogames on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after @CAPS1 done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on facebook. You can just login and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computers to the other. My last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. People get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. These are my reasons that computers are good..I lived in a dream my sweet   In a dream of you   My dream was a joy complete   'Cause you loved me too...      And I was no longer afraid of   What the future might reveal   For the stuff that dreams are made of   Was suddenly real      Love of my life   Life of my love   I used to pray   And pray you'd hear me   Love of my life   Angels above   Sent you at last   To stay always near me      Now we are one   Never to part   And evermore   Need I implore you to miss me   Come to my arms   Come to my heart   Kiss me   Kiss me      Come to me   Come... to me   My... life   My-why love...   Love of my life   My life   My-why love....What ya hear   Is it clear?.Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?.Masculinity?.Already to hand you, my dear Mr. Wrong..Moving forwards using all my breath   Making love to you was never second best   I saw the world thrashing all around your face   Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace      I'll stop the world and melt with you   You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time   There's nothing you and I won't do   I'll stop the world and melt with you   Dream of better lives the kind which never hate   Dropped in the state of Imaginary grace   I made a pilgrimage to save this human race   Never comprehending a race that long gone by   I'll stop the world and melt with you   You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time      There's nothing you and I won't do   I'll stop the world and melt with you   ....I walk through this old lonely house   The tears fill up my eyes   How could I have fallen for his old tricks?.I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences   Gaze at the moon till i lose my senses   I can't look at hobbles and i can't stand fences   Don't..... fence me in..I never thought I could act this way   And I've got to say that I just don't get it..These drills locked in your nails   Scratch across the sky   Hunting on, figure out   Tell the truth from lies      Everywhere listening   Every word you say   Thinking from the way around   Yeah, think I found a way   Come on!.I guess we were just....I was alone   I told my mouth to shot up 'cause I was talking to myself   like I always do when I'm stuck   Well, I was crying   You could be crying too   I was screaming throungh the windown, I keep missing you   And the tears came down from the sky   And the rain feel hard on my eyes      Now you know what I look like, I'm feeling like a fool   I lose on my own, I'm going back to school      And I will pray, Hallelujah, you'll be breaking every rule   and come back to stay, I'm feeling like a fool      I really tried so hard to design my life   There's a big black void in head like it's been cut by a knife   Every time your name comes around this stupidity follows me down      Now you know what I look like, I'm feeling like a fool   I thought I could swim I'm drowning in the pool      And I will pray, Hallelujah, you'll be breaking every rule   and consider to stay, I'm feeling like a fool      Please, come back to stay, I'm feeling like a fool   I'm feeling like a fool in my heart   I'm feeling like a fool.Why don't you go down, ol' Hannah   Don't you rise no more   If you come up in the mornin'   Bring judgment sure   Well I look at ol' Hannah   She was turnin' red   Well I look at my partner   He was almost dead   Said if you get lucky,   Or make it on your own   Please go down by Julie's   Tell her I won't be long   Kept sayin' I was a good man   But they drove me down   Yes, I was a good man,   But

don't want to be   Just a memory   I don't want to be   I don't want to be   Gone      You don't know my name   You don't know my number   You don't know my face at all (at all at all at all)   We walk right past each other, every single day   Like cold machines, we're marching on and on and on and on and on      Got your thumb print always with me   Got your barcode memorized   They came here to electroshock me   But can they erase you from my mind?.Some folks are morning people   I never was one of those      [Chorus]   All the same   I get in the game   Give me muddy, muddy water   Now

"Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits..Who'd care enough to send you flowers, that you could call at all hours,   And give your love to?.Pay my last

down upon the train   Silence settled in his brain   He reached out his hand   And touched her hair   He struggled with the   Same old though   Should he tell her   Should he not   He felt her presence   Everywhere      Whatever comes between us   Don't let it stand in your way   This is what he'd come   Here to say      She just smiled   And read a book   Gave him such a   Gentle look   He felt a pain right   Through his chest   He pictured back to   When they met   Open door on a movie set   Her brown eyes took   His breath      And every word she   Spoke to him   Went like a bullet to

"Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers I believe that computers can teach you things such as, hand-eye coordination and how that, can open job doors for you. Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, ""@CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?"", and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards..You must have been a beautiful baby   You must have been a wonderful child   When

you'd be looking for   If I'm sweet tonight   Things look different in the morning light   I'm jealous and I'm proud   If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud   I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry   That's me      Are you sure you want to hear more   Would I be the one you seek   Mild and meek like the girl next door   Don't you realize   I may be an angel in

But I do believe in sympathy   That's me, you see      Are you sure you want to hear more   Won't you have a drink with me   Just to see you're not really sore   I can't help my ways   I'm just not the girl to hide my face   I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry   That's me      There's a special love   Like an eagle flying with a dove   I'll find it in the end   If I keep on searching, but until then   I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry   That's me.Why, why can we never be sure till we die   Or have killed for an answer,   Why, why do we suffer each race to believe   That no race has been grander   It seems because through time and space   Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore..Yea that's the way you love me huh?.I have all faith in you   And these tenderest moments (these tenderest moments)   We circle low   Embrace the night as she draws us in   A holy shroud   A veil to hide our tenderest moments   This must be all that there is   Times don't come much more beautiful   You can show me places that my eyes have never seen   I'm followin' you   Where are you taking me to?.[Chorus:]   I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),   Now I (now I) turn to face the cold..I'm a fool to want you   I'm a fool to want you   To want a love that can't be true   A love that's there for others too      I'm a fool to hold you   Such a fool to hold you   To seek a kiss not mine alone   To share a kiss that Devil has known      Time and time again I said I'd leave you   Time and time again I went away   But then would come the time when I would need you   And once again these words I had to say      Take me back, I love you   I need you   I know it's wrong, it must be wrong   But right or wrong I can't get along      Without you.And I can feel a hurricane when you shout   I should be safe forever in your arms   I should be safe forever in your arms"
"@ORGANIZATION1, I would like to tell you computers are very helpful in our society today. Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up nig news & you needed to get it? Were did you turn to? I know not a book, but to the computer. Without it how were you going to get your info. I think computers are benefitial to our society because it can help you learn and it could tell you when or where to sign up for activities. People interact with others different countries, states, & or continents. Next, is how computer could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance today my class & I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers my class & I couldn't have get it done without the computers. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all & that would mean we would have to share. With sharing some kids @MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two. With computers we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computer can help set up activities. Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym signing up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance my little brother plays baseball & my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sihn up, register, & pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents didnt with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge & able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are benefitial to our new up & coming society!.No one ever thought this one would survive   Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind   Lock you in a dream, never let you go   Never let you laugh or smile, not you..(Need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya)   Yeah, oh, oh, need ya, need ya, need ya, need ya, yeah..Uh huh   What's wrong?.When she wakes up this morning and turns to kiss me   She'll find I let her sleep 'cause we talked so late last night   She'll know I kissed her face gently till my returning   And when she finds the rose on my pillow, I know she'll smile      Her amazing love, unending   Is so much more than I am worthy of   If the rose could speak my feelings   She'd know I cherished her amazing love      If I call her a little late she forgives me   Her voice does not betray, she's spent another day alone   She softly thanks me for the rose and says, I miss you   And then I can feel her smiling on the phone      Her amazing love, unending   Is so much more than I am worthy of   If the rose could speak my feelings   She'd know, I cherished her amazing love [unverified].Let's find another reason..Does a day go by like a memory?.I can hear Jesus

"Computers. They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits man-kind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the otherhand, Computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy to use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all purpose dictinary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrasination is very easy to give into. But self control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework, and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound text book, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, excersising, and seing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landsacape. Self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this. I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer..Swing and turn jubilee   Live and learn jubilee.Let me sit on your porch, let me drink a beer   Let me scratch that hound dog's ear

"Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @CAPS2 one week can @CAPS5 your vision from a @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you keep it up now it @MONTH1 not seem bad but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer..She never gets wet   She smiles and it's a rainbow   And she speaks   And she breathes   I wanna be Kate      Down by

"Computers are very important, I don’t know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager. Most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is myspace and facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but comp. have webcames so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do with out a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family membere there are mosly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it. This is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a comp. is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice dont spend all!! Day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy your self in any way possible..About the honky tonk blues,   Them jumpin'

What was once your pain will be your home      All around the table the white haired men have gathered   Spilling their sons' blood like table wine   Remember everything I told you   Everything in its own time      The music whispers you in urgency   Hold fast to that languageless connection   A thread of known that was unknown and unseen seen   Dangling from inside the fifth direction      Boys around the table mapping out their strategies   Kings of mountains one day dust   A lesson learned, a loving God, and things in their own time   In nothing more do I trust      But we own nothing,

you   Keep it in your heart like a stone   And when the winds have blown things round and back again   What was once your pain will be your home      Everything in its own time   Everything in its own time.And all the worlds they've shown you   Just make you even greedier..You..I'm gonna get dressed for success   Hitting a spot for the big time, baby..Might never be mean   Might never be cross   Or

bad love   Some fast love, is all that I've got on my mind      (ooh ooh, baby baby)   Ooh, yeah yeah (ooh ooh, baby baby)   What's there to think about baby?.pulse of the ?.Is there nothing left but silence in between..No harm done, you're under repair..Going back to the memories   Reminiscing bout you and me   Thinking how it used to be   It's plain and clear I treated you bad   But girl you know that I care   Every relation (ship) have wear and tear   Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says      Many days and many nights   Many heartbreaks, many fights   Many wrongs but so many rights   So girl don't let this love die   Never meant to cause you no pain,   Girl I never meant to treat you lame."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 that use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus @CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for @CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. @CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example @CAPS2 fast is like texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to @CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is @CAPS3 somewhat. All people should have a computer. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and @CAPS2 make life better..We filled the day with careless displays   Going sailing with nothing to say   When I fell   We could tell      Now you're torn apart   The sun's driving fast   Taking photographs   It's morning at last   And the sailors are taking a stand   With their heads buried deep in the sand      Feeling well   Life is swell   When I fell   We could tell   Hooray   When I fell   We could tell   Feeling well   Life is swell.Dale!.We'll do some music plays the wrong side of nightmare   Juke-box models collide   The scent on the fire escaping blazing to the sun   Embracing the old suicide pride   I spent a few lifetimes making spinal connections   Down on Einstein Boulevard   I've to to walk a tightrope now the rampart is so high   I swagger like a neon guitar   With the wide boys   Up on the streets   Wide boys   Ah, go on and meet me   Wide boys   Delightfully unpleasant   With the foxy adolescent (???).(sings)   First I choose a fabric from the rack   And I pin the pattern down,   And I stitch it in the front and back   And it turns into a gown!.It's not your way...yeah...

"More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse..When I was a little girl, I had a rag-doll   The only doll I've ever owned..A thousand arms to hold you tight

and I   Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him   She knew in her heart that he'd lied   But nothing that I could have said could've saved her   No matter how hard that she tried   Cause she'll offer her soul to the darkness and danger   Of something that she's never known   And open her arms at the smile of a stranger who'll love her and leave her alone   And you know he's the

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 stand on this hole computers thing is that it is becoming a big issues because people are spending all there time in books instead of comuitateing with friends and family, exercising, or injoying nature.

"Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have an people are not good. They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before..Chestnuts roasting on an open fire   Jack Front nipping at your nose   Yuletide carols being sung by a choir   And folks dressed up like eskimos   Everybody

I do what I can   I do OK   But right now   All I want to do is   Get real   If that's alright with you   Woke up last night under the mountains   Driving from Zurich to Milan   I lay there listening to the echoes   Thinking of Iceland and Japan   So many smiles So many faces   And my home so far away   I lose some of me in all these places   And I can't help the way I'm changed   All over the world in eighty days   Memories turn like magazine pages   What kind of a man could live this way   I do what I can   But I can't escape it   Right now   All I want to do   Is get real   If that's alright with you   Right now   All I want to do   Somehow   Be myself with you   All over the world in eighty days   Alcohol haze of information   What kind of a man could live this way   As long as I have   And stay the same   Right now   All I want to do is   Get real   If that's alright with you   Right now   All I want to do   Get real   If that's alright with you   For just one night with you

"School, family, and sports is @CAPS5 my always tells me. Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said ""you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic."" @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!.Got no tactics, got no time on hand..Now you manufacture happiness   And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction      [Chorus:]      All you toy soldiers and scaremongers   Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder   In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before      Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly   You know I love you more than slightly   Although I've never said it like this before      [Chorus:].Yes, love take me where we've never been before   Feelin's, just lead us on   Till we know where we're goin' mhmm..Sewn together, joining heads   Just a matter of time   'Til you rip yourselves apart   Millions laid out in their   Crowded tombs   Sickening ways to achieve   The holocaust   Seas of blood, bury life   Smell your death as it burns   Deep inside of you   Abacinate, eyes that bleed   Praying for the end of   Your wide awake nightmare   Wings of pain, reach out for you   His face of death staring down,   Your blood running cold   Injecting cells, dying eyes   Feeding on the screams of   The mutants he's creating   Pathetic harmless victims   Left to die   Rancid Angel of Death   Flying free      [ Angel of Death   Monarch to the kingdom of the dead   Infamous butcher,   Angel of Death      Angel of Death].Free (Be glad that you are free)   Free to change my mind (Free to change your mind)   Free to go most anywhere, anytime (Free to go most anywhere,anytime)   I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free, yeah (Be glad that you are free)   There's many a man who's not (There's many a man who's not)   Glad for what I had baby, (Be glad for what you had and)   Glad for what I got, oh yeah (for what you've got)   Oh I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free,yeah (Be glad that you are free)   Free to change my mind (Free to change your mind)   Free to go most anywhere, anytime (Free to go most anywhere, anytime)   (Be glad that you are free)   (There's many a man who's not)   I'm so (Be glad for what you had and for)   (what you've got).We're willing to take the risk   I won't go!.If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye   It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry   When waking from a bad dream   Don't you sometimes think it's real?.Tears may go, but, I'm lonely too   My love is just like the ocean   Oh, please come back to me   Cause I won't die girl, for nothing   Oh, your not blind to see   Oh, I won't die girl, for nothing      I can't give you more, I can't give you more   I'll never find what I am searching for   I can't give you more, I can't give you more   There's no one else, this love you can't ignore.sparked up sess   Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??.We got right with the usual (mutual?).It's a Saturday night and I'm home alone   With the music on quiet I'm flying solo   Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat   Put the music up loud hear it in the street   Then the neighbors start banging on my front door   Throw the door wide open saying what's your point   Come on in let's rock this joint      We got the whole house rocking [Repeat: x5]   To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll      We dance out of the door, dance into the street   And all the people are swaying to the musical beat   We rock down the road and down to the town   And all the people stare and smile and they get down   Then the police man says ""stop this noise""   But the beat takes over now he's one of the boys   The beat's taken over now he's one of the boys      Come on down let's rock this town      We got the whole town rocking [Repeat: x5]   To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll      Let's go   Let it roll   Are you ready?.(T.

"Computers. An achievement @MONEY1 technology and science that improve all @MONEY1 our lives. They let you explore the world in one click and chat with your friends. What could be wrong with that? I'll tell you. I belive that computers are ruining our society. Now don't get me wrong, I like them, but they can be bad. People get on and never get off, you never no who it is your chating with online, and they can cause tons @MONEY1 stress. Let me explain why computers can ruin lives. When the computer was invented I'm sure this wasn't the purpose. To stay on playing mindless games, or randomly searching the web. Some scientists have even studied the @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the time, the more you are online, the more likely chance you will become obiece. That is not what @LOCATION1 needs. You say you'll be on for a minute, but you will stay playing ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" for days on end. People with @CAPS3 work to do might never get on. Also it is just flat out a waste @MONEY1 time when you could be outside playing a @CAPS3 game. My second reason is that when you are ""chatting"" or ""@CAPS4'ing"" someone, who is it really? A study conducting proved that when you think your talking to a friends it is really some perverted @NUM1 year-old looking for ""fun."" @CAPS5 huh? Also when you talk, someone could be inbedding a virus in your system that could take @MONEY1 to fix. How mad would your parents be? It could be happening with every letter you press. Finally stranger or not, some @MONEY1 these people leave links to get to disgusting websites that you pray your parents don't see. My final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress. When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty fueds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damge to your grades. For every @NUM2 people when join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, afffecting their quality @MONEY1 work. In this economy I don't think we need more layoffs. Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get sucked in stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad..I left my heart in Metropolis!.And then those funny familiar forgotten feelings   Started walkin' all over my mind..You are any way the wind blows   Any way the wind blows in      Don't wanna come down too low   Any way the wind blows   Any way the wind blows in      Don't wanna come down   Do you know the way   To be in one place but stay?.You believe in honor   And you believe in jesus   But not in nicaragua   Not in nicaragua.Can't take my eyes off you..No matter what they say, I disagree..I drink because I'm worried, I don't drink because I'm dry..I just want all those modern romances   Always being in love   When any girl smiled at me I went wild at the touch of her clothes   Then bang it's off before I know it   Poor broken hearted me      Better think twice before falling in love again   Better think twice before falling in love      Jackie's all alone in her room with the TV on   And she's crying, crying   Wondering about how her and Joey been getting along   All this lying, lying   Tell her this, tell her that   Where's these lies gonna end   Things would be much better if her and Joey just stayed friends      Better think twice before falling in love again   Better think twice before falling in love      What's in it for you?.You got a lot of homies, I see that nice   I gotta kinda wonder if you stick like mice or not   When it gets hot who stays, who runs   Who be holding ground, who be bucking like shotguns   You gotta lot a muscle, would they tussle for you?.why can't it be for me?.Tell me the time..[Sean Paul]   All you need to know is the vibe round' here we built and instill it   Sean Paul alongside   Fabolous, you done know we bust   Telling them again, hey!.Since the day she passed away, everything's just the same..Allright you guys   Chester, when you're ready bud   The shade is a tool, a device, a savior   See, I try   (You better watch out)   And look up   (Where?).Fools be   gettin'   done, but over dumb reasons..Put it out until Judgment Day   I'll bear that same old cross on Judgment Day   Oh!.The ruiner's a collector he's an infector serving his shit to his flies   Maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will   Suddenly realize   Maybe it's a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go   And maybe that fucked me up so much more than you'll ever know   How did you get so big?.What do you want, baby   One last piece of my heart   What do you need, baby   We could make a new start      I'm not scared   All the nights alone   Lying there crying with the television on   Watching those scoops about love and happiness   Wonder what I ever did to deserve a fate like      I don't wanna be around   For that famous final scene   I just can't help myself   I'm a fool for your love      Leave me alone, please   My heart can't take any more   You left me going crazy   It started like just like a phone      You're the number one   You're the only one I need   If you don't want my love   Then set me free      I don't wanna be around   For that famous final scene   I can't help myself   I'm a fool for your love      Don't come closer   You know I'm easy to phone   You don't love me   Any fool can see   I'm telling you goodbye   Bye, bye      Leave me alone, please   My heart can't take anymore   Leave me alone, please   Let me walk out that door   Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone      I don't wanna be around   For that famous final scene   I just can't help myself   I'm a fool for your love      I'm a fool for your love   I'm a fool for your love   Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone   A fool for your love   I'm a fool for your love   Leave me alone, please   My heart can't take it no more   Leave me alone, leave me alone.I awoke this morning   Love laid me down by a river..Oh   Ah!.Now the courtroom is quiet, but who will confess   Is it true you betrayed us?"
"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I belive that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communication with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or videochat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends.

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't live to go on the computer? Well myspace, facebook and aim is like a online hangout. Kids every where log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before. Sometimes the best thing to @CAPS1 is get some fresh air and interact with others. Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . Most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off. How you see how computers have a major effect on people by not interacting with others, not having enough, and kids wife sneaky and will go on other website, they wer not allowed to go on and if thier parents wernt home..I thought I found the gal I could trust, watta bust, this is how the story ends:   She's gonna turn me down and say, ""Can't we be just friends?"".Every little counts   When I am with you   I think you are a pig   You should be in a zoo   I guess I should've known   I'd end up on my own   Every second counts when I am with you      Every little counts   When I am with you   Even though you're stupid   I still follow you   The smile upon your face   It always stays in place   Every little counts oh, when I am with you   (Do-do-do-do...)

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student at @ORGANIZATION3 middle school in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 recently you produced an article about computers where good or bad people I write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. This is true because computers help people with things hand eye coordination to learning advances to our schools finally it helps people communicate with ease, @CAPS7 plase consider the following. First of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using ther hands and eyes together. @ORGANIZATION1 ullodhers from @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1 ""Computers help hand eye coordination @PERCENT1 more than putting your son or daughter on the football team"" @CAPS8 computer games could help kids get more acurate with there skills or that of any sport. @CAPS7 now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination. Secondly Computers help people learn new things. Although people might think to be false it is indeed true. @ORGANIZATION1 a recent study at @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT2 of schools in @CAPS6 use computers for research.Finally recently had a paper about @PERSON2 and The only scorce I thought of was wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. @CAPS7 now you understand the computer is a helpful learning tests. Finally the computer is a great way to communicate online. It is better than @CAPS10 because it is faster and more than calling someone up and talking for. @CAPS8 it is alot cheper than @CAPS10 because you just have @NUM1 payment a-month unlike phone. Where it starts to add up. Inract @PERSON1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 of @LOCATION1 in a recent study that ""@CAPS10 are absolete now, with the internet peope can chat at lignning speed"". Finally using e-mail or facebook is @CAPS7 much better than phone tag on facebook you know where you can chat with. @CAPS7 thats my reasons that the computer is good for communicating. @CAPS7 now you see that computers are nessecery because they develop hand eye coordination, they @CAPS8 help people learn and finally they are a great way to communicate..He's on top....Everything I want I have   Money, notoriety, rivieras   I even think I found God   In the flash bulbs of your pretty cameras,   Pretty cameras, pretty cameras   Am I glamorous, baby am I glamorous      Hello, hello!.I'm hiding under the floor, like Saddam, but I'm   Doin it because I love it, and I'm underground baby,   Real underground baby!.(a capella: she said: boy, your luck is running out...

" I think that you can never spend enuf time on the computer it feel there is no bad effet computors can have on you they only improve your life is why. For one thing if you need to find out a important fact date or time. You can just look it up on the computor. The internt is a never ending sorce of knolage and you can learn just about any thing that you need to know just by searching it on the computor.Another usefull thing the computor dose is the ability to talk to people useing eother @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 or that rooms you can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relitive on the computor and you can even hook up a web camera and actuly see theam as they talk to you something a phone cannot do. Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up. And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had. And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real. Now I have mentioned some of the many thing why you can never spend enuf time on the computer shure exersise and nator can be helth but you can do only of that stuff I just mentond by takeing a nator walk so wont you agree computors improve our life more then they are unhealthy..Can you hear the noise?.There's no goin' back to find   What we had..So listen if you wanna survive      Inside this High School Miserable   I never thought I'd be invisible   In this High School Miserable   You gotta keep being indivisible   In this High School Miserable   Don't understand what is happening to me   In this High School Miserable   Someone get me back on tv!.He lies down beside me..So I've made my mind up I must live   My life alone   And though it's not the easy way   I guess I've always known   I'd say goodbye to love..Man in the sky   You say you are flying   To lose sight of the world   You wanna stay high   Then don't deny   Your feeling inside      'Cos I believe   If you give   A little bit of love   To those you live with   A little bit of love   Oh oh oh   Has gotta come your way..Take it easy (take it easy)   Try to cool it girl   Take it nice and slow   Does your mother know?.Pick me up!.Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams..Every day, it's a-getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster..Let's make it last all night..Again this is Mr. Ian Sheridan our friend..All you need is elves, Love   Elves are all you need   Elves are all you need   Elves are all you need   Elves are all you need   Elves are all you need....Contained in everything I do   There's a love, I feel for you   Proclaimed in everything I write   You're the light   Burning, brightly   Onward through the night   Onward through the night   Onward through the night of my life      Displayed in all the things I see   There's a love you show to me   Portrayed in all the things you say   You're the day   Leading the way   Onward through the night   Onward through the night   Onward through the night of my life      Onward through the night   Onward through the night   Onward through the night of my life.I never know   Floating away among the clouds to where nobody knows      I held my gun with both my hands   Slowly aiming at the shining dot   The shot went off, that dot blew off   Since then I've never seen the kite again.Don't hide the world[?].[Verse 1]   Tell me what you want   What you like   It's okay   I'mma little curious too   Tell me if it's wrong   If it's right   I don't care   I can keep a secret could, you?.I've been thinking of leaving   But I can't raise a buck,   James, I'm wondering could I borrow your truck?.One more time   (Can I get a witness?).Have to throw these covers down   To get some sleep tonight..And I love you   I love you   I love you   And I love you   I love you   I love you"
"Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. @CAPS1 opinion is computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @CAPS1 side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has @CAPS2, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The goof of is you can get those chorse. Oh not that make me to. @CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. @CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. Excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many shore. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend, ""yo sup man,"" ""not, you"" ""not much, just fiding around for some exercise"" ""same here, same here"" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @CAPS1 friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. Like i said be what was @CAPS1 friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So @CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love @CAPS1 family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @CAPS3 time with family and friends..I'm no believer   I just listen to my own head   I'm no believer   I just call you liar instead      Keep all your sorrows   Words might be the   pathetically vain   Life is a fire   Light and you can read your name      I'm the king of a night generation   I'm anithing my   mama don't like   I'm a slave of a perveted nation   Anything my mama don't like      I am a flyer   Rising in the wake of my dreams   I am a tumbler   Life can be as good as it seems      I'm a child playing chess with tomorrow   I'm anything my   mama don't like   I'm a clown, I'm a beg steal and borrow   Anything my mama don't like      I'm the king of a night generation   I'm anithing my   mama don't like   I'm a slave of a perveted nation   Anything my mama don't like.But we're safe in each other's embrace,   All fears go out as I look on your face      Better think awhile   Or I may never think again..You know nobody can drive quite like I can,   Runnin' every red light in town,   We danced on the floor, danced on the street,   Danced as the wheels turned around..The wise men were consulted,   And the Bridge of Death was crossed   In quest of Dionysus,   To find out what they had lost..Just can't wait no not another minute..I Up on the wire   I like to climb and play with the sky   The people far below   The air is clear   And I can perceive   The whole world is shining   Life is sublime   And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth far behind you   As I step and dip and leap into a space beyond   Up high   Just for a moment   Alive   And so afraid but alive   As I push against the sky and my heart has broken free

leap into a place beyond   Up high   Just for this moment   Alive   And so afraid but alive   As I dip against the sky and my heart has broken free   Broken free   Broken free   Up high.But I never

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health..In these days of mine for keeps I'm trying to hold on   Suddenly you're all out of reach and everything goes wrong   What we say and what we do are entirely different things   Meaning lost straight through the roof   That's not how it should be      Easy like a bird   I ride the breeze   My mind is falling      You're so ordinary   You're my sanctuary in the morning, darling   New sensation, love vibration   Heart to heart and a long goodbye      You go your way and I'll go my way   Life is truer than fiction   In this crazy land of milk and honey   Life is just an illusion      I just don't know what to believe in   If the truth be known   Suffering from soul fatigue   Weathering the storm      What we say and what we do are entirely different things   Whispered voices fill the room   That's not how it should be      Swaying like a tree   I feel the sky   Somebody calling      You're so ordinary   Be my sanctuary in the morning, darling   New sensation, love vibration   Heart to heart and a dumb goodbye      You go your way and I'll go my way   Life is truer than fiction   In this crazy mixed up world of honey   Life is just an illusion, darling      [Illusion, darling...]   [You're so ordinary...]   [You're so...]   [You're so ordinary...]      Easy like a bird   I ride the breeze   My mind is falling      You're so ordinary   Be my sanctuary in the morning, darling   New sensation, love vibration   Heart to heart and a long goodbye      You go your way, I'll go my way   Life is truer than fiction   In this crazy mixed up world of honey   Life is just an illusion      You're so ordinary, sanctuary   Be my one in the morning, darling   New sensation, love vibration   Heart to heart and a dumb goodbye      You go your way and I'll go my way   Life is truer than fiction   In this crazy mixed up world of honey   Life is just an illusion      You're so ordinary, sanctuary   Be my light in the morning, darling   New sensation, love vibration   Heart to heart and a long goodbye      You go your way and I'll go my way   Life is truer than fiction   In this crazy mixed up world of honey   Life is just an illusion darling      [Darling]   [Darling]   [Darling].You can't hold me,   I have told you..Cancel the world,   Erase history,   There is no future,   As far as I can see,      We're going left on right,   And I don't want to see you again,   Going left on right,   And I don't wanna be your friend,   We're going left on right,   And I don't want to see you again,   Going left on right,   And I don't wanna be your friend..It must have been the mistletoe!.But you look in my eyes for the ghost of love that died..I'm a melancholy man, that's what I am,   All the world surrounds me, and my feet are on the ground..Y'all think I'm a God damn fool   [Polow da Don] Nigga I ain't sayin' all dat   [R.

"Dear local newspaper @CAPS1 I think that kid's should be alowed to go on here computers. So they can talk to there relitives across. The @CAPS5 @CAPS2 they want to. I have family members in @LOCATION1. I talk to them evry day because I have a laptop and they say that. I have relitives in @LOCATION3 I belive them because I have there email. They told me about my mother living in @LOCATION2. So I asked her she seaid yes that is true and I looked up were my mom lived. Thanks to computer also I learned that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in The @CAPS5. So I asked my mom @CAPS2 I can go to @LOCATION3 she said yes. So I went with my sister and we even visited are family members and the @CAPS6 point I can tell you it looked exacly how. I pichered very tall coverd with trees. Birds @CAPS7, scwerwels climing trees the thing, that surprised me the most was there was a house on top of the mountine. For sale I wished that my mom was thier because she will love it. So ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers. Lastly you can even look up people on the internet. I herd that criss rock almost died. So when I got home I went on my laptop and looked it up so I did and it said nothing about. That but it did say one thing that surprised me. The most it seaid that he was geting a divorce. From his wife I think the peorson how said. That he almost died most of missed read it. So now I look up all my fraverit people. Thanks to computers the time is now to accet @CAPS2 people should have computers to use to lern about the @CAPS5 or just think what everyone sayes. So I hope you make a good chouse.

"My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. ""But"" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!.Clemens basements   I scratched records and performed a few tricks   KDC mix let the Black man talk shit   Pumpin the new sounds town to town      Who holds it down like Bad Leroy Brown   Now I won't stop cause yo I'm Kid Rock   The Genuine Article      They don't want me   'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done      F-F-Fames a costin the price ain't nice   Its like the roll of the dice   For a whole new life   But don't get my song wrong      I enjoy it a lot   Walkin around like a big shot   'Cause I'm Kid Rock   Smooth as an ice cube      Cool as an igloo   And more complex, than a rubix cube   A healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue   Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run      And as I incline through time to get mine   I try not to slide, but walk a straight line   Though it's hard when the climb gets steep   The one who finds is the one who seeks      So I sought and fought   And a lot I got taught   And although I left those who stole got caught   Many shows I rocked      Many suckers I laughed at   And those who snapped back usually got slapped   The cat if I was strap   'Cause I was a son of a gun      Livin' life on the run   Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none   Bold, Young, Handsome, Bad like Bronson   Pumpin' the new sounds town to town      And when in motown I cool out in Greektown   On the upside with nuthin' too high   The Genuine Article      They don't want me   'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done   Chuck nice break that beat down   Uh huh...Uh huh..Uh huh   KDC...huh      Six Generations of rap and I'm first   Ready to burst, the style is rehearsed   I worked and worked and worked and I worked   When many thought I was just gettin jerked      Used, abused, but I paid my dues   And now no one out there could fill my shoes   And my pants and do this dance   This shit didn't happen by chance      It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick   Ain't that a trip when I started from zip   And now up and up and up I won't stop   The flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock      Yes me the low key MC   With the ability to rock a party   Anywhere and make people stare   I'm lookin while I'm cookin with no care      Pumpin the new sound town to town   Who holds it down like bad Leroy Brown   And still I won't stop growin this flat top   The Genuine Article      They don't want me   'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done.Someday I'll get over you..ROSE SELLER      Who will buy my sweet red roses?.B: Er, what's in this drink?.And why does it   What's that word?.Bricks and mortar reflecting social change   Cracks in the pavement reveal cravings for success   Why do we try to hide our past   By pulling down houses and build car parks?.(How can you resist me?).When will you die?.And started reading about me   The words she's written took me by surpise   You'd never read them in her eyes..Oooohhh from grace men fall, babylon curse of all creation,   Winged serpent of the pit monstrosity..No,   God walk with you always..If you wanted the world   I'd surround it with a wall I'd scrawl   These words withe letters ten feet tall   To you, with love.You are the one that's meant for me   I'm twisting fate to make believe..Anywhere got to get you away, feels so good think it's gonna be a new day..Metal Punk is rising wild   Antenae scouts the way   Ready for the danger   In the game he has to play   Nowhere to hide   Nowhere to live   Nowhere to run   Metal Punk   No time to die   Metal Punk -

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive affects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting, without exercise and aren't nessasary..We like explosions that leave you feeling good   We like ideas that change the world for good      There's nothing past the stop 'n' go   There's nothing but the ebb and flow   There's nothing like some in and out   There's nothing more than what you know      We like new places that jets can't take you to   We do like music when it does what it should do      Yes oh yeah   Yes oh yeah   Yes (we like) oh yeah (explosions)   Yes (we like) oh yeah (explosions)      We like explosions it's only right we should   We like ideas we thought you understood   We like new places until they're overrun   We do like music, loud shots from the big spudgun.Lost and all alone..Fix what I see and God, please fix me..On the swing boats when you ladies go, mind the crowds below,   Take care what you show..Don't try and push your ???.We all have our faults....Soon enough you'll be walking   You and me hand in hand   The silly words you'll be talkin'   Only daddy can understand   We'll go out making snowmen   Building castles in the sand   And all the time I'm thinking,   Will this kid end up smokin' weed?.I   And now I just belong to you   There's no one else to satisfy   Oh baby I'll be strong for you   Until they come to realize ... realize ... realize that      Since I found a new love   Since I found a new love   Since I found a new love   Since I found a new love      I have no fear at all   No fear at all   I have no fear at all   No fear at all   I have no ... fear at all   I have no ... fear at all   I have no fear ... at all   I have no fear ... at all.Oh I believe together there can be a better way   Oh if we believe together we can build a better way..You know I love, I love ever' lit' thing, about you babe,   I love it   I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you baby..Oh baby, your arms and your legs are shattered   Where is my boy?.Didn't you ever hear my story?.Up in the morning and out the door   She won't come in I gotta live alone   Back in the evening with the darn poor fool out   I got on mind just this gal, just this gal.I don't want to lose you..Ordinary, ordinary      High, high [?].How'd ja like to stay up late, like the islanders do   Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe   If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island   You will never stray, for ev'ry day   Your Christmas dreams come true      How'd ja like to stay up late, like the islanders do   Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe   If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island   You will never stray, for ev'ry day   Your Christmas dreams come true.When I'm riding 'round the world and I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that   And I'm trying to make some girl   Who tells me, baby maybe come back later next week   Cause you see I'm on a losing streak.(CHORUS)   If I give it all, if I give it all away..She spread herself wide open to let the insects in   She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she's been   She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin   Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within   Oh my beautiful liar   Oh my precious whore   My disease my infection   I am so impure   Devils speak of the ways in which she'll manifest   Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress   Need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness   I now know the depths I reach are limitless   Oh my beautiful liar   Oh my precious whore   My disease my infection   I am so impure.Living close to the ground!.Once I was alone   So lonely and then   You came out of nowhere   Like the sun up from the hill      Cold cold as the wind   Warm warm were your lips   Out there on the ski trail   Where your kiss filled me with thrill      Weekend in Canada a change of scenery   Was the most I bargained for   And then I discovered you and in your eyes   I've found a love that I couldn't ignore      Down down came the sun   Fast fast beat my heart   I knew as the sun set from that day   We'd never part      Down down down down came the sun   Fast fast fast fast beat my heart   I knew as the sun set from that day   We'd never part   Down down down down came-a the sun   Fast fast fast fast beat-a my heart   I knew as the sun set from that day   We'd never part   We'd never part   We'd never part"
"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat thier friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer..Ah, you look so good to me   With my eyes open wide, I can see   Ah, you feel so good to me   And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free.Escape me?.There ain't no way around it, y.ou know I would have found it      There ain't no song in the whole wide world could hardly sing without you..Don't stop....And one fine night, I'll be holdin' on tight...

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are very dangerous to the modern day socity and how we are connected to them. So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers. First how hamful it today is @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers. In america theres only @PERCENT2 is nature with nice forest but as people reporduce more will be gone forever due to expantion. So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer. Next these computers our little robots that are really taking over the world and its getting very dangerous with how much it's destroying the ability for humans to breath this happens because theres a hipno disk in all computers making us stay close sufficating us like a deadly drug it's a horrible addiction. Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours. This addiction will kill us and knone knows how to talk about it. Secondly, millions on top of millions live in the @LOCATION1 @NUM6 keep on their computers for ours on a time you would think that their alone in every @NUM7 people are done the rest are being killed by chatting on the @CAPS2 and letting their life flow right out of the window. Now interaction is harmful as you already know but you forgot @NUM8 a day do elligal things on the internet like download music wich they shouldn't be they could be put away for up to @NUM9 years for this talk about an iteraction, with the police. Lastly web inter action like myspace they haves satified sexual effenders who could come to your house at only time and take you away would you like that to happen you could never see your family in every @NUM10 people @PERCENT4 are kidnapped due to myspace alone stand up out of danger. Thats a harmful work it is. Finally the dangers of a world like this with how the government whats to mess you up. These people are considered are mad and dangerous with laywars who want to get you. One in every @NUM11 people can't keep up with payments. Next did you forget about those other @PERCENT3 who dont have computers they are living the life walking with @CAPS4 on the edge of myth. Lastly and unfortunatly those @PERCENT1 perstent witho computers are likly to die within the next @NUM12 years due to a dealy poisin that the compute diliveres to your brain. In conclution this world can be one of the more angerest. So come to gether get a friend go for a run now and then. No friends go talk see your family instead of one of those vertual meaings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants your money. Now what we need to do is attak the robots back. People should go for a run cut of some of the obisity from sitting down all day lose @NUM9 pounds or more. Remember the world would survive if you trash that zombie @CAPS2 room.

"Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relitive move, when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of you run stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people ""skype"" on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new ""social networking series"" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways..You are the one who makes us feel glad   Please don't be sad to take up the straight life you had   We wouldn't have

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The age of the computer is upon us. Every where you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree, I feel that the computer is a great @CAPS5 to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society..Moon over miami,   Shine on as we begin,   A dream or two that may come true,   When the tide comes in..I keep looking back   At

"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 ""isn't that great""!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt .Boy, whatcha want me to do?.(Do, do, do, do, do..I'll fuck you up so bad, Tony wouldn't want to Touch ya      [Xzibit]   Lets get upclose and personal, malicious, Sid Vicious   I bang bitches, you might find yourself missin tonight   Rapper's Delight, keep it at the house but ain't fuckin it right   Got'choo stuck in the headlights, can't move   Impact is all of the sudden, vehicular homicide   But I ain't stoppin for nothin   Me and my cousin, strong buzzin, and playin a dozen   Pushin and shovin', leads to gettin sucked and rolled up   Like a nigga with a mask and a gun, hold up   Rappers act like they ain't gon' die for small fry   Try to reply, don't touch what you ain't gon' buy   I ain't gon' lie, motherfucker love to get high   Barely get by with scraps and pennies   Now we winnin Grammy's and Emmy's   And party with the henni and remi   Got a big bang theory nigga keepin it hot   Its the art versus ???.Evil woman..And through it all we rise and fall..Ooh, ooh..Never can say goodbye..Cause you got...

"Dear local news paper, In @CAPS1 oppinion I think that those who makes compiuters should make up an times added to the compiuters. There should be a law that people has to go out and exercise before and after then use compiuters finally, I think that childrens should use the compiuter less than the adult fee health reasons. @CAPS1 first oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should make timers added to the compiuters to time tha amount of tim people should take depending on what they are doing like when some one is playing a game they spend hours playin instead of doing a diffrent activity. Also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad. @CAPS1 second oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have a law that people has to go out and exersise before and after they use compiuter because there is a big percentage amount of people who are obeast because everyone sits in the sits in the compiuters and starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours and they dont take a break to go outside and @CAPS1 third and final oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have childrens use the compiuter less than the adults for health reason's because kids are always looking at the compiuters an their eyes are always getting red and then they start to not being able to see as well as they used to then they end up having to need glasses or abetter perpscription glasses. Also becaus kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people who they dont know so they end up getting raped or kidnapped by the person that they went to talked to for hours. So local news paper will you make that change for the society and for the childrens? Because I would!.I'm lookin' for my one and only   Every time I turn around   I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely   I'm lookin' for my one and only      I'm riding home in pain again, baby   But that don't mean shit to you   You're currently engaged   In an intimate conversation   With a young groupie or two   They say ""Players only love you   When they're playing games""   Still, I gave my heart to you   I should have stayed away   Like my friends all told me to      Every time I turn around   I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely   I'm lookin' for my one and only   Every time I turn around   I find my heart in pieces on the ground   Why can't I find my one and only      See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow   Make me sing real high   When he goes down low   But see, it ain't just a physical thing   He's gotta treat me affectionately   And I gotta know he won't betray my trust   Just like every other motherfucker does   Is this just an impossible dream, baby   Too elusive to pursue   It's been such a sad and windy road for me   Just searchin' for the truth      Every time I turn around   I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely   I'm lookin' for my one and only   Every time I turn around   I find my heart in pieces on the ground   Why can't I find my one and only      Now you know I roll a Beamer and a Benz   And I'm dishin' out N's   While you trippin' on a playa   Baller, havin' bitter conversations   While we're rollin' on 24's   And I know you got doubts   Why you listen to what people talk about   You ain't figured out why they call ya   The heavy steady hatin' cause   You rollin' on 24's   See how your money flows   You dress in designer clothes   From head to the toe   You ain't satisfied, well tell me   What you lookin' for      I'm lookin' for my one and only      Well, I'll be your one and only   If you give me a chance   I'll make the change for you, girl   I know I ain't been the most faithful   Nigga in the world   But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls   Spittin it to ya while I roll a shisha of fire   To kiss your lips, I desire   Twist and Mariah, together like a   Grip on the tire      I'm lookin' for my one and only      Well, come on Shorty, let me make it better   We can do whatever   While we're sittin' on suede and leather   Thinkin' through the city   While we rollin' lonely   Let's kick it in the Chi   I know I messed up with ya, I ain't gon' lie   I know you were feelin'   You really know your guy   But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high   Let me pick the pieces up   And put them back together cause I want to be with you   Don't want to leave you lonely   Ride with you like a homey, never, no phony   Shorty, can I be your one and only      Every time, oh mm   Every time I turn around   I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely   Why I'm looking for my one and only   Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha   I find my heart in pieces on the ground   Why can't I find my one and only   Still lookin' for my one and only   Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha   I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely   Yeah, I'm lookin' for my one and only   I'm lookin' for my one and only   Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha   I find my heart in pieces on the ground   I'm lookin' for my one and only   Why can't I find my one and only, ah.(Traditional - Arr..Oh no   Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath   Say what you feel 'cause I got nothing left, oh   I made a promise to myself last night   I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right      [Chorus]   And if I lose it all   There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall   'Cause knowing you are out there breathing   It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it   I lose it all, if I lose it all      Wouldn't matter anyway      Don't change a thing   Perfect as you are   Time has a way   Time is all I've got   If my heart should shatter watching you   That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove      [Chorus]      And we will be waiting when I fall into your open arms   I believe you'll find me there   You'll find me there      [Chorus: x2]      Wouldn't matter anyway.Do (do) you (you) feel (feel) me?.There was a wicked messenger   From Eli he did come   With a mind that multiplied   The smallest matter   When questioned who had sent for him   He answered with a thumb   For his tongue it could not speak   But only flatter   He stayed behind the assembly hall   It was there that he made his bed   Often times he could be seen returning   Until one day he just appeared   With a note in his hand which read.The uhhh...

"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most imfortant thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time.

"Dear @LOCATION1, I understand this focus situation, the effect of computers or our society people's reactions are less than about them & my question to is who? Computers a very good effect on our town's specify. Computers areaids in tracking hand-eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things & talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty. Let me explain more these reasons. Computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand-eye coordination to kids & adults. Just to help you understand why in to teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you. In foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself. In baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill, but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone & hurt them, ability to day back. Computers are great way to this skill in a saw Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to do have a good our town? Well, computers let people to that. You can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have I do have another reason. Computers have to samethings electronically so fast easily, make a look on computer's hard drives, @CAPS2 are so much more that ran be on a computer, that make a room empty. Before my famiy had a computer complete dedicated to papers files that your so important & that we could not lose. When up got picture, typed up paper, saved our was empty! I hope that this letter has proves to you computers effect on our society. Computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination. The help to thing happen but if done on real life could faster of they also help to electronically than a. So now, after this letter you go out i publish this telling every good effects of computers.

"Dear @PERSON1, Experts are concerned about the use of computers. They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree. While people use the computers, they don’t interact and meet new friends in person. They stay inside and don't get excersise, and kids might talk with strangers. When we use computers we chat with friends online and don't really interact with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize, so that is one disadvantage of a computer. Another problem is lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy. Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers. Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info. Kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. Kids and even adults dont interact with freinds, lack exercise, and give personal information to strangers..I!.In my dreams an old friend came to see you   Right from the start he was the stealing kind   You'll never know how much it hurt me darling   The night you left his loving on your mind   I keep dreaming of you all the time   Then and only then you're really mine   There's sadness when you go away and I face another day   Yet I keep dreaming of you all the time   [ fiddle ]   Last night again I dreamed we were together   I held you close the way I used to do   I kissed your lips and said I found my heaven   You whispered low how much you love me too   I keep dreaming of you....Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?.Looking good through the window   Shinin' red and blue light   A little thick in the bottom   But still lookin' alright, yeah   Got a pocket fulla money   Got me a long night ahead   A quick stop by the bulldog   Score me some panama red, yeah   Wham, bam, oh Amsterdam   Yea, yea, yea   Stone you like nothin' else can   Yea, yea, yea   Hot damn, roll an Amsterdam   Yea, yea, yea   If she can't, then nothin' else can   Caught a plane outta Moscow   Spent one cold night in Berlin   It's a long hard way   But I'm a comin' back again, yea   Wham, bam, oh Amsterdam   Yea, yea, yea   Stone you like nothin' else can   Yea, yea, yea   Yea, come on now, roll an   Amsterdam   Yea, yea, yea   If she can't, then no one else can   Yea, yea, yea...

by bernie taupin   Available on the album rock of the westies      Like a corn in a field I cut you down   I threw the last punch too hard   After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time   To throw in my hand for a new set of cards      And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend   I figured we'd painted too much of this town   And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon   And I knew then I had lost what should have been found   I knew then I had lost what should have been found      And I feel like a bullet in the gun of robert ford   I'm low as a paid assassin is   You know I'm cold as a hired sword   I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up   You know I can't think straight no more   You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of robert ford      Like a child when his toy's been stepped on   That's how it all seemed to me   I burst the bubble that both of us lived in   And I'm damned if i'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel      And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man   Your friends and mine don't call no more   Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded   Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law   Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law.And I was lost for words   In your arms   Attempting to make sense   Of my aching heart   If I could just be   Everything and everyone to you   This life would just be so easy      Not enough time for all   That I want for you   Not enough time for every kiss   And every touch and all the nights   I wanna be inside you      We will make time stop   For the two of us   Make time stop   And listen for our sighs      Not enough time for all   That I want for you   Not enough time for every kiss   And every touch and all the nights   I wanna be inside you      In our fight against the end   Making love we are immortal   We are the last two left on earth   And I was lost for words   In your arms   Attempting to make sense of   My aching heart   If I could just be everything   And everyone to you      Not enough time for all   That I want for you   Not enough time for every kiss   Not enough time for all my love   Not enough time for every touch      Not enough time for all   That I want for you   Not enough time for every kiss   And every touch and all the nights   I wanna be inside you.La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la   La, la,

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family..Al tuo fianco sentire   per le silenziose stellate ombre,   salir le voci delle cose!.Meccha leccha hi, meccha meccha cholly ho      He's doin' well, I gotta kvell   The yentas love him, even shicksas think he's swell   Show up at his home, he says, ""Shalom!"".Got to give up all of my control!.I was twenty one years when I wrote this song   I'm twenty two now, but I won't be for long   People ask when will you grow up to understand   Why all the girls I knew at school   Are already pushing prams      I loved you then as I love you still   Tho I put you on a pedestal,   You put me on the pill   I don't feel bad about letting you go   I just feel sad about letting you know      I don't want to change the world   I'm not looking for a new England   Are you looking for another girl?.it's an insturmental like jimi said, but a great instrumental..""Oh Man!"".He's gotten so lost   He's been double-crossed   By a change in the wind..In the latest midnight hour   When the world has gone to sleep   You gotta get up   When doubts begin to rise   And the world is at your feet   You gotta get up      Reach, It's not as bad as it seems   I cleanse in the river for somebody else,   For anyone but myself      I'm not a selfless man   I'm not a man of wealth   If I had all the world,   Probably give it to myself   But the trees begin to walk   And the ground begins to talk   And myself      Reach, It's not as bad as it seems   I cleanse in the river for somebody else,   For anyone but myself      Hold my place   Don't you give up on me   Hold on, hold on      Reach, It's not as bad as it seems   I cleanse in the river for somebody else,   For anyone but myself      Reach, It's not as bad as it seems   I cleanse in the river for somebody else,   For anyone but myself.Tell me how to win your heart   For I haven't got a clue   But let me start by saying I love you   Hello!.Wondering if what they say is true..Put your foot around the bend   Drive me crazy to an early grave   Tell me what is there to save tonight   Both ends burning   Burning   Burn      Keep on burning till the end, until the end   Keep on burning till the end, the very end.You're callin' from a bar?.Ride the days and sail the nights   When it's over, you'll find the answer   Runnin' in the rain      There's a hope that's growing and a vision too   All those angry hearts now reach out for you   Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?.I've been around the world in a plane   Settled revolutions in Spain   The North Pole I have charted   But can't get started with you   And at the golf course I'm under par   Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star   I've got a house and a show place   But can't get no place with you      You're so supreme   The lyrics I write of you   Dream, dream, day and night of you   Scheme just for the sight of you   Baby but what good dose it do   I've been consulted by Franklin D.

" I think having a computer is good because you can research stuff and you can meet people and chat with them. Computers are important to society because it helps keep track of info like doctor appointments and crimnal records for police to follow by. having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes. Having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved and have website that they can talk to you on like myspce or facebook or even yahoo chat. When having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas. Computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school. Having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses.

and they went on relief   The bank took away their diplomas, they locked them up inside   Of the chest and she moved away to Oklahoma   And got a tattoo on the side of her breast, God damn   My socks are still hard from lying on the sofa on the night   She was over in my backyard, yeah, we was shooting the breeze out   Amongst the trees when a shot rang low and left her standing   Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road   Father have mercy, get her a nurse please, she's almost alone   I saw her hand reaching out for the telephone, we rather see her   Locked up inside a home than see her standing   Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road   Headlights flashing on her skirt in the wind, yonder comes a truck   It drove by two men, shotgun man leaned out and said   ""Do you want to take a ride?"".[Chorus]   We're the happy, happy people      We never give opinions and we never state views   After all, you can't be sure that what we say is true   And if you want to join us, you can follow on behind us..You're still young, that's your fault,   There's so much you have to know..There's the castle on the hill..Something's clutching at my head, through the darkness I'll be led..These bitches calling me Manning Eli   Manning Eli, these bitches calling me Manning Eli!.""American Tune"" is a Paul Simon song..Tonight when I first saw you I knew it had to be,   Why'd you have to be so right for me?"
"Dear @CAPS1 I think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. Because right now some job are going bank ruded. And parants can not help because they didn't have job to support there love ones. Another thing is that cars are going up on prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car and truck for great prices. And it can help you save a lot of money in your pocet. For some reason @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to go to far away places for example @CAPS2, put or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. And you if go to these place then you would need place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends. So you would need a nice pleasant holetitle which will have awsome food, beds, pools and more thing people like to do when they is on vaction. And for example if your mother or father what you to go to your public school but you don't what too because you heared something or about the school say because you cant find great school online for example @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, And some other school are the best to and fun to go to and be succesful with your life. Now you know why more and more people use computers and you should always use technology and it would help you on the hand eye giving people the ability to learn about use computers..Come on!.It's

worried you'll get it wrong for me   There's four love songs so which one did you write for me?.'Cause you are      Your love   I am just another piece of an island   I can't close my ears when I hear that you call..For she the mother of all men had counseled me so wisely that   I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay..Now I know the rules..I'll see you 'round the world..Brown pulled a knife, jumped on Pete,   Fought from the counter right on out to the street..Don't understand nuthin', but I like it..She's mostly gone, some other place..Don't you wish that you still were mine?.Call me when you're ready!.cherchez les personnes qui jettaient les cig   Es sur l'stage, s'il vous plait..If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two   You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you   And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming   I know I must be dreaming.It's hard to hear what he has to say cause Everyone around me is just the same way..Feel those vibrations flow in my brain..I'm doing fine..Ohhhh..I've never been the type who's gonna wait around   Not make a sound while others bring me down   I'm not someone who'll tell you what you want to hear   Oh you've got to feel by keeping it real      And until now I've been patient   I've been good somehow   But anticipation's leaving me no doubt   About how it will be   When you let go of your fear and release      [Chorus:]   Let's move it to the fast lane   Take a chance and love me   I'll give you all I have   I'm good like that   Baby, when you crash into me   You'll finally understand   How loving me can change all your plans      I'm good like that   I'm good like that   Don't make me have to tell you that I told you so   'Cause I know you know and it's hard to hold   I cannot do this feeling, you'll find there's double meaning   To the things I say when you walk this way      Just relax, let me take control of you, sit back   Make you see where all this goes   I'm in too bad - what you got to lose   Compared to what I'm offering you?"
"According to the @ORGANIZATION1 govermant @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer a day. A study shows @CAPS1 are't getting enough exercise, aren't spending enough time with fmaily, aren't enjoying their lives. Right now people would rather be on the computer then doing other stuff.Since more people have been using the computer those people heven't enough exercise. Now @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have gone obese since they have always been or the computers, @CAPS4 year a @CAPS6 was fit and healthy, but when a friend told him about a website within the @CAPS5 @NUM2 minutes. After @NUM1 months, the fit and healthy @CAPS6 became obese. The @CAPS6 would always have junk food when @CAPS7 was on the computer. when @DATE1 came, @CAPS7 tryed out for his school baseball team. @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 was out of shape. After that happened, @CAPS7 went to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport @CAPS7 plays. Next people aren't spending enough time with their families. A lot of jobs require people to be on the computer. When that happens a person will forget whats really important to them. A couple years ago, a @CAPS6 was going to have the biggest game of his life. It was the championship game. @CAPS7 was reminding his dad about it all. When the gone was about to start, the @CAPS6 looked into the crowd for his dad. @CAPS7 didn't see him at all. The @CAPS6 was just think his dad was. after the @CAPS5, @CAPS7 looked again, but now @CAPS7 was sad. His own dad wasn't at the game. His team @CAPS4 the game. Now his dad doesn't miss a thing since @CAPS7 doesn't go on the computer as often. Finally, people aren't enjoying their lives they would rather be on a computer than doing stuff they like. One @CAPS6 used to always play basketball with his friends when @CAPS7 started to go on the computers, everything changed people would ask him to play, but @CAPS7 would say no. The computer was the only things that mattered. When the @CAPS6 tryed out for his @CAPS8 school @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 forgot how to play. When that happened, @CAPS7 stopped using the computer and went back to basketball. now when @CAPS7 tries out., @CAPS7 makes. It's now or never to decide either waste your life on a computer or live your life. I would rather live life than be on a computer..Let me know, oh my God   What I am supposed to do   I hope you don't mind   My asking you   I beg you to heal me   My body and my soul   You are my hope

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun..Pick me up!.Nelson:   You've got to wait to fight   Only do it when it's right   Got to break their line   They'll be swimming in the brine   Pick your time to shoot   Then they're ships we're going to loot   Going to be a hoot   For scurvy have some fruit      Sailor:   Half-time orange, anyone?.Could have been forever..If it's early in the morning and my breath stink   Would you still roll over kissing on me like it ain't?.Lala how the life goes on..Give a new meaning to ""ho, ho, ho""   Shake that ass girl, bump your booty in the snow   So watch out Santa, you jolly old troll   We'll be strippin' that sleigh and leave you the coal      [Girl as Dina Rae:]   Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells   Jingling all the way   Oh what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey   Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells   Jingling all the way   Oh what fun it is to ride   From to Detroit to east L A      [Bob Rivers as Eminem:]   Playin' Reindeer Games, hell yeah my friend   Grab Rudolph's horns, see how far they bend   When his nose turns red, his ass gets sent   Back out to the woods with his faggy elf Randall   Santa Claus wouldn't list me as nice   In fact, he'll have me listed as 'naughty' twice   Not cuz' of the fights, or the Christmas gift heist,   Because of all the nog, I left on his wife   It's time for old Nick to move and retire   'fore we roast his nuts on a big ass fire   Yes I'm that bad, Yes, I'm that crude   I mean ya ass is huge, lose weight, for real dude   All the cookies and milk, simply quite sick   I mean, when's the last time you've seen your dick   I don't mean to throw a fit and I'm not one to bitch   But every year I get underwear, socks, and shit      [Girl as Dina Rae:] (Bob Rivers as Eminem:)   Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells   Jinglin' all the way   Oh what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey   Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells   Jinglin' all the way   Oh what fun it is to ride   From Detroit to East L A   (Yo)   Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells   Jinglin' all the way   Oh what fun it is to ride in a drop top Chevrolet, hey   (Yo, yo)   Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells   Jinglin' all the way   Oh what fun it is to ride   From Detroit to east L A.Lies ain't no harder than telling the truth..[P.

able to digest some solid food"
"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it. I went on youtube and type in""nike sb skate lair demo"" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount..[Chorus:]      Can't blame you (as above)   See me now, see me no more   I heard that whistle blow   I knew it's time to go   Sitting here in this train   Going so fast past the trees   I'm thinking of words to apologize   'Cause sorry ain't enough      [Chorus:]      Can't blame you (till fade).I know what you like (Eh! ).[Chorus]   Come home   Come home with me   Come home with me      Your words will always stump me when   I just need something right   I wanna kiss you as the sun comes up   And turns out Friday night   I got a good mind to get right down to it   And forget the way I sweat when you're walking through my eye      [Chorus]      I know that I should be ashamed   To see you walk away again   And I've heard every excuse before   But you're just too much for me to lose   Help me girl   Stop looking so good      [Chorus].I've had no sleep, sad songs..Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men   Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when..I'd like to do a thing   That a new american anthem until we get another on together..In the basement, whoa down in the basement   Oh, you got the comforts of home, a nightclub too..The box you live within is strong and it's up to you   To see beyond the comfort zone you've grown to love..At first we three thought   'Twas the biblical cord of life   Then noticing 'twas connected to his head      How strange, not to believed   I reached out to feel, and the pony's eyes opened   The cord got hard, the head looked around   And you know who pushed and gushed   The waters of life   First two hooved feet, then the shine of his fur      But at first to my eyes only   Feather -

"I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers. In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business of work related. But then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day. What they could be doing is enjoying life. Going outside and getting fresh air. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites. Such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are obsessed so thoes are teo websites that are very addicting to some people. and then these are the people who just like looking things up. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. And use the computer only when you need to. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment. But all things are good in moderation. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers.

"Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today..But I still feel the power,   Of you

Are you the one.Chorus:   Yeah!.Children in his arms, he turns his back..You floated in, we floated up..Tell me you believe in love   It's not an illusion...      [Verse 1: Liam:]   I've been thinking about the nights   And the dangerous tricks people play on the eyes of the innocent   I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke   And mirrors disappearing right in front of them      [Hook: Harry]   But believe me, I'm not trying to deceive you   I promise falling for me won't be a mistake      [Chorus: Zayn]   No baby, this is not an illusion   I've really got my heart out on my sleeve   Oh baby, this is not an illusion   There's magic between you and me   No baby, this is not an illusion   You've really got me lifted off my feet   So tell me you believe in love   'Cause it's not an illusion to me      [Verse 2: Liam]   You don't ever have to worry about me, about how the cards fall   I'm all that you need tonight   I would never turn your heart into broken parts   You don't have to think twice looking in my eyes      [Hook: Louis]   Can't you see it?.My bones are decayed, my flesh it doth rot   I'm lying in silk, take the lid off this box   My lungs gasp for air, my eyes scream for sight   I promise the rise of my body this night   Summon the dead   Baphomets call   Blood on my hands   Screaming in torment   I'm telling you all   Take heed of my plea   Answer my call   I'm gonna be free.Looking for some hotstuff baby this evening   I need some hotstuff baby tonight   I want some hotstuff baby this evening   Gotta have some hotstuff   Gotta have some fun tonight   (hotstuff) I need hotsttuff   I want some hotstuff, I need hotstuff   Looking for a lover who needs a lover   Don't want another night on my own   Wanna share my love with one-woman lover   Wanna have a love all my own   Gotta have some hotstuff baby this evening   I need some hotstuff baby tonight   I want some hotstuff baby this evening   Gotta have some loving gotta have love tonight   (hotstuff) I need hotsttuff   Hot love looking for hot love   Hot hot hot hot stuff hot hot hot hot (repeat)   How's about some hotstuff baby this evening   I need some hotstuff baby tonight   Looking for my hotstuff baby this evening   I need some hotstuff baby this tonight   I want some hotstuff baby evening   I want some hotstuff baby this tonight   Yeah....Try to remember and if you remember then follow."
"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?.Written by don helms and hank williams   Recorded by ray price feb. 8, 1952, with the drifting cowboys      (d) you ask me why my (d7) hearts so (g) sad,   And (d) why the teardrops fill my (a7) eyes,   A (d) heart cant sing thats (d7) filled with (g) pain,   How (d) can it (a7) laugh when it (d) cries..Between the salt sea and the sea sand   Or never be a true lover of mine..All through the night, from a height far above,   You and your love brings me ecstasy..I knew that if I waited I would win..Now my baby brother just sits and recollects the same regrets..No red river ever ran deeper   Than an old cowboy love,   Than an old cowboy love that runs true..La la la la la la la   La la la la la la   La la la la la la la la      La la la la la la la   La la la la la la   La la la la la la la la      Dance through the night,   From sublime to extreme..I meet you for coffee   We get together periodically and   I got a bad case I can't shake off of me   The fevered wanderin round wondering how it ought to be   You work in the system   You see possibilities and you're glistening   Eyes show the hell you're gonna give 'em   When they back off the mic for once and give it to a woman   I dream like a mad one   Brutal fantasies I catch as catch can   I'm a psychic and a laywoman   I see love and I like to make it happen   What we get from your war walk   The ticker of the nation breaking down like a bad clock   I want the pendulum to swing again   So that all your mighty mandate was just spitting in the wind   It doesn't come by the bullwhip   It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips   It's not the company of gunslingers   The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger   She is she is she is   It's fine about the old scroll Sanskrit   Gnostic gospels the da vinci code a smash hit   Aren't we dying just to read it and relate it   Too hard just to go by a blind faith   But they left out the sisters   I've been praying to a father god so long I really missed her   The goddess of benevolence   You should listen to your mama if you have a lick of sense left   Pushed under by the main press, buried under a code of dress   Relegated by the Vatican   But you can't keep a spirit down that wants to get up again   If we're a drop in the bucket   With just enough science to keep from saying fuck it   Until the last drop of sun burns its sweet light   Plenty revolutions left until we get this thing right   2006 words and music: Emily Saliers.Ooh, darling, what can I do?.Because the music do   And then it its reaching   Inside you forever preaching   Fuck you too   Your screams will whisper   Hang on you   Twisted transistor.Yeah!.Power mad, driving out of the shadows,   He never tires when he plays..I'm a make you beg for it,   Beg for it   I'll give you what you need   Only if you say please!.Tell me to run and I'll race,   If you want me to stop I'll freeze,   And if you want me gone..All I ever ever hope to be   Depends on your love for me..John: Fade!.I'm a stranger here   And I just moved into your town   I'm a stranger here   And I just moved into your town      Because I'm a stranger   Everybody's doggin' me around   Doggin' me around      Sometimes I wonder why they treat a stranger so   Yes sir, sometimes I wonder why they treat a stranger so   They all should remember that they're   They're gonna reap just what they sow   Just what they sow      Sometimes I wonder do my baby know I'm here   Sometimes I wonder do my baby know I'm here   You know that she do   My baby don't really care      Well, I'm goin' down south if I wear out 99 pair of shoes   Well, I'm goin' down south if I wear out 99 pair of shoes   You know I will be welcome, I won't have these stranger blues   These stranger blues      Well, the train stopped here cause the tracks are out of line   Well, the train stopped here cause the tracks are out of line   I'm gonna pack my bags   I'm gonna move on down that line.Five foot two, eyes of blue   But, oh, what those five foot could do   Has anyone seen my gal?.That's ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok?.She just couldn't wait, my baby just couldn't wait, no..Faith is believin', faith is for overcoming."
"Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers..In my loneliness   When you're gone and I'm all by myself   And I need your caress   I just think of you   And the thought of you holding me near   Makes my loneliness soon disappear      Though you're far away   I have only to close my eyes   And you are back to stay   I just close my eyes   And the sadness that missing you brings   Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings      Yes I love you so   And that for me is all I need to know   I will wait for you   Till the stars fall from out of the sky   But what else can I do?.Good God, if your song leaves our lips   If your work leaves our hands   Then we will be wonderers and vagabonds   They will stare and say how empty we are   How the freedom we had turned us up as dead men      Let us be cold, make us weak   Let us, because we all have ears   Let us, because we all have eyes   How they knew that this would happen   We're so run down   Good God!.Consequences dictate   Our course of action   And it doesn't matter what's right..Where have all the young girls gone?.All all together,   The whole wide world around,   I may not know their lingo,   But I can say by jingo,   No matter where you live we can shake hands..I wanna love you, yeah, yeah   Over and over again   I wanna see, see what your life, life can be   (Over and over)      Hey, hey, baby   Don't say goodnight when you know   It's time for love   Hey, hey, hey, hey   Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know   I gotta have your love      I wanna feel you   I wanna thrill you,   I want to caress you   Ooh, never let you go      Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby   (Don't say goodnight) Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know   I gotta have your love   And oh, baby   (Don't say goodnight) Don't say goodnight when you know   I gotta have your love      Some people say   That life is for the livin'   So let's live it, baby   Yeah      Most of the people say   That love is for the givin'   So let me love you, girl   Yeah      Hey, hey, hey, hey   (Don't say goodnight) Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know   It's time for love   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, baby   (Don't say goodnight) Don't say goodnight when you know   I gotta have your love      Some people say   That life is for the livin'   So let's live it, baby   Yeah      Most of the people say   That love is for the givin'   So let me love you, girl   Yeah      And hey, baby   (Don't say goodnight) Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know   I gotta have your love   And hey, baby   (Don't say goodnight) Don't you ever say goodnight, oh, when you know   I gotta have your love      And ooh-wee, baby   (Don't say goodnight) Don't ever, ever say, ever say   Don't ever, ever say   Ever, ever, ever say      Don't say goodnight.We can ride forever   Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury   Changing gear I pull you tighter to me   I'm your turbo lover   Tell me there's no other   I'm your turbo lover   Better run for cover   We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive   And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive   We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky   Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry..She been there before,she'll never give in,   She'll be gone tomorrow like the silent breeze..You just can't smile it away   It's much more than passion it's love   And I've heard some people say   They've seen love move mountains      You just can't laugh it away   It's too deep inside it's love   Not just some game you can play   For a laugh then go on your way      Let's sit and talk it over   And work it out I love you so   And can't we just talk it over   And see what we can do      You can't just pass it away   Like some silly fashion no it's love   And love comes eager to stay   It won't just leave you that way      You can't just pass it away   Like some silly fashion no it's love   And I've heard some people say   They've seen love move mountains no it's love   And I've heard some people say   They've seen love move mountains.All the tears you cried, you're dyin' inside   When will you decide to survive      Chorus (2x)   You can give up   Or you can get up   Just don't let what you need pass by   Spread your wings to the sky   Let your soul fall in love      You can fly   Fly   Fly   Fly   Fly      (4 x)   You can give up   Or you can get up   Just don't let what you need pass by   Spread your wings to the sky   Let you soul fall in love      You can fly.Was invited to a party,   Then there was a fight..My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold..I got a job in a steel mill, shucking steel like a slave..Take a deep breath   'Cause it all starts now   When you pull the fuckin' pin   The shrapnel burns   As it tears into the skin   Every wonder what it takes   To be questioning your faith   This is what it's like   When it happens every Goddamn day      Violence is our way of life      Shards of life   Like confetti in the air   The flesh storm grows   As it breeds despair   You hear screams in the distance   Fighting the resistance   Not cries of war   These are just the sounds of pain      It's all just psychotic devotion   Manipulated with no discretion   Relentless War      Killing's in style   And it's not the main event   The cameras are whores   For the daily bloodshed   Like a junkie   Hungry for a fix of anything   The media devours   And feasts upon the inhumane      Violence is our way of life      It's all too fuckin' clear   We can never coincide   So let's all drink   To genocide   All the venomous sights   Border on the arcane   In times of war   Everything is bound by pain      It's all just psychotic devotion   Manipulated with no discretion   Relentless   Warfare knows no compassion   Thrives with no evolution   Unstable minds exacerbate   Unrest in peace      There's no future   The world is dead   So save the last   Bullet for your head      Only fallen have won   Because the fallen can't run   My vision's not obscure   For war there is no cure   So here the only law   Is men killing men   For someone else's cause      It's all just psychotic devotion   Manipulated with no discretion   Relentless War.Thought I saw an eagle   But it might have been a vulture,   I never could decide..everybody, let's play!.Sleep, pretty darling,   Dot not cry   And I will sing a lullaby..Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?.[Chorus]   Grab yourself a can of pork soda   You'll be feeling just fine   Ain't nothin' quite like sittin' 'round the house   Swillin' down them Cans of swine      Ha ha ha!.Take me as I am..If you were a bluebird you'd be a sad one   I'd give you a true word   But you've already had one   If you were a bluebird,      You'd be crying   You'd be flying home   If you were a raindrop,   You'd shine like a rainbow      And if you were a train stop,   The conductor would sing low   If you were a raindrop,   You'd be falling   You'd be calling home      If you were a hotel   Honey, you'd be a grand one   But, if you hit a slow spell,   Do you think you could stand one      If you were a hotel,   Well I'd lean on your doorbell   I'd call you my home   If I was a highway,      I'd stretch alongside you   I'd help you pass by ways   That had dissatisfied you   If I was a highway,      Well I'd be stretchin'   I'd be fetchin' you home"
"Many families across the globe use computers, whether their from @LOCATION1, all the way to the deserts of @LOCATION2. However, believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise, In @CAPS21 perspective. I can agree, with there, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computer on @CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?"" that is where students can got their @CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many shops like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a catolog online, where you and effenly. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and @CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily. These are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many @CAPS16 you can play, like @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14-@CAPS15 @CAPS16) I play many of these, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17. I love these @CAPS16 because they are very amusing world. You watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via @CAPS18. @CAPS18 is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. A @CAPS18 video is ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22,"" a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored. I can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @CAPS16 called @CAPS23. With this, you can play many fun @CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science. In @CAPS21 science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motion/gravity. You can also conduct research on the web, you with many projects. I know I use the web to with almost every project I have..[Chorus]   Music make the world go round   Where it goes(where it goes)   Ya' just don't know(ya just don't know)   My heart is like a marching band   I'm a fan in the stands   Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby   Saying hey baby      So baby please don't leave me   Don't you go(don't you go)   Baby no,no,no(baby no,no,no)   My heart is like a marching band   I'm a fan in the stands   Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby   Saying hey baby      Two dope boys in the Cadillac still   'Kast, the crown on ya Cadillac Seville   I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)   Like your DJ got killed   The fire marsh,   Fire Marshall   Shut'er down,time to go!.Scenes from a night's dream, poor little Nemo!.You lively up yourself and don't be no drag   You lively up yourself, 'cause this is the other bag   Hey, lively up yourself      Lively up yourself, other bag   Can you dig it?.Here we go again (again)   Here we go again (again)   Here we go again (again)   Here we go again (again)   Here we go again (again)   Here we go again (again)   Here we go again (again)      Feeling it ramble, what can I say?.Going away, yeah...

"I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day..Maybe we can share it all forever,   But not 'til we do..Slow talkin', the line you're walkin'   Look like a viper wearin' silkin' stockings   You make 'em guess they'd be gettin' the best   Can't help but wonder if you'd pass

fundamental things apply   As time goes by   And when two lovers woo   They still say I love you   On that you can rely   No matter what the future brings   As time goes by      Moonlight and love songs   Never out of date   Hearts filled with passion   Jealousy and hate   Woman needs man   And man must have his mate   That no one can deny   It's still the same old story   A fight for love and

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, More and more people use commputers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society and I am one of theose people, that does not agree. I disagree, because is your on the computer all day you'll forget bout things. For example, you will forget to exercise, you will forget nature, you will also forget to interact with your friends and family. I promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view. People soend to much time on the computer, and they don't exercise like they should. Exerising is very important, that helps you with . Exercising helps you grow. it makes you stronger. If your on the computer all day then, you'll exercise and develop right. Another reason, I think its such a lead idea is you do not get to enjoy nature. When your on your computer you can not go on an hike in the woods. You can not go on camping trip. You can not do the thing, in the pleasant air of nature. The last reason but defenitly not the least you will forget to interact with your friends and family. That is so important because a computer could do a lot. It could teach you a lot but it canot do it you and @MONTH1 I love you. Only youre family and friends could do that. Hopfully you under and realize my point of view. People should stop doing this you forget to exercise nature and to spend time with you friends and family. All I got to now thank you for the oppurtunity to listen to my idea..It's funny how things work out..Met her on an oceanliner, called her Cocaine Carolina   She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two..Fifty for the watch (watch) a hundred for the bracelet   I'm headed to the top (top) I can damn near taste it   I represent my block (block) and give away the ones (c'mon!).Am I to believe   That a God would give His Son?.I've got faith,   I've got faith,   Faith of the heart..We're all in the back singing ""Roxanne""   Just watching life pass us by..Looks like we're riding on the same train   Looks as though there'll be more pain   There's gonna be a showdown..Yea!.Billy, the themepark shark   Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head,   Billy, the themepark shark,      He looks just like a killer, in the wild, he'd be dead..I had to say it twice   Swagger so nice..[Pre-Chorus]   Been in this state of mind   Been in this state of mind   Been in this state of mind, oh yeah      [Chorus]   Baby, you got lucky cause you're rocking with the best   And I'm greedy   Cause I'm so greedy   Cause I'm so   I ain't talking money, I'm just physically obsessed   And I'm greedy   Cause I'm so greedy   Cause I'm so greedy, ooh   You know that I'm greedy for love   You know that I'm greedy for love   Cause I'm so greedy, ooh   You know that I'm greedy for love   You know that I'm greedy for love   Cause I'm so      [Bridge]   Greedy, I'm greedy, I'm greedy, I'm greedy   I'm greedy, I'm greedy, I'm greedy, I'm greedy for love   Greedy, I'm greedy, I'm greedy, I'm greedy   I'm greedy, I'm greedy, I'm greedy, I'm greedy for love      [Chorus]   Baby, you got lucky cause you're rocking with the best   And I'm greedy   Cause I'm so greedy   Cause I'm so   I ain't talking money, I'm just physically obsessed   And I'm greedy   Cause I'm so greedy   Cause I'm so greedy, ooh   You know that I'm greedy for love   You know that I'm greedy for love   Cause I'm so greedy, ooh   You know that I'm greedy for love   You know that I'm greedy for love   (You know I'm)   Cause I'm so greedy, ooh   You know that I'm greedy for love   (Oh, don't you know I'm greedy?).Trembling, shaking..Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home..[BACK TO CHORUS].All you wanted from me, all I had to give,   Nothing matters you'll see, when in paradise you live,   The plane is diving faster, we're getting near the ground,   Nobody is screaming, no one makes a sound..[Verse 2 - D-tay]   They call me D-tays up   Get em up put the aks on,   Let em know we don't play sir,   Anybody in the way gets sprayed brah,   Anybody in the way gets sprayed brah,   Wanna play rough?.Oh, those famous last words   Oh, how they hurt me   They go down in my memory   As the saddest I've heard   Oh, those heart breakin' words   She whispered so sweetly   Like I love you, believe me   Famous last words..Til I finally died,   Which started the whole world living,   Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me..I know you   I care too   I see through   All of the pictures that you keep on the wall   All of the people that will come to the ball   But hear me calling   Won't you give me   A free ride..I tell myself,   ""Hey!.Who   Put on your heart?"
"Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and its bad for their health. People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me thats very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ingnore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your soical activitys with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exerise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you..I curse the day that your smile fades away, till then I pray      A burning candle in-between and at both ends   With all that we've learned, yet we still pretend   I just wish you could say my name again      They made the lock and broke the key,   The culprit was the mercury   The vaccine wipes your memories,   Till you forget even how to breathe   A tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceive      So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye   The setting of the sun reflecting in your eyes   Day after day after day the world will pass you by   I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie      You forget to remember it's time to say the long goodbye.When shadows beckon on dim-lit avenues   Night people hear

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 back a couple decades ago, before computers existed. What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, @PERSON2 had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children's computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""@CAPS3"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person , only through technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I @CAPS6 urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today..And Grace, my fears relieved..Woah, woah      Pussycat, pussycat, you're so thrilling   And I'm so willing to care for you   So go and powder your cute little pussycat eyes   Pussycat, pussycat, I love you, oh, yes sweet, I do      What's new pussycat?.O Little town of Bethlehem   How still we see thee lie   Above thy deep and dreamless sleep   the silent stars go by   Yet in the dark street shineth   the everlasting light   the hopes and fears of all the years   are met in thee tonight      For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above   while mortals sleep the angels keep   their watch of wandering love   O morning stars together   proclaim the holy birth   and praises sing to god our king   and peace to men on earth.It's you that I could never live without..Is that your lover?.You, the question, answer they cried..He'll get you some   You ain't got no car?.un,esperienza religiosa      E,come un,esperienza religiosa   Sentirti in ogni istante, in ogni cosa   In questa notte buia   Gi?.Do I love you, do I?.Well, there?s a method to this madness..Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire   Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire   But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire   And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire?.Chorus   In the navy, you can sail the seven seas   In the navy, you can put your mind at ease   In the navy, come on now people, make a stand   In the navy, can't you see we need a hand?.There must be something I can dream tonight,   The air is filled with the moves of you,   All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah..Wish someone would tell me when   I won't think of you again..To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication   The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,   And the circling is worth it..Hit!.How can I go on, hey girl      [Instrumental]      Hey girl, now sit yourself down..From a Jack to a King..You get around   You want me   You come around   You need me   This time around   I won't be back at all      Maybe misery is   What I need to keep my sanity   And I don't mean if things don't go my way   I'll be pleased to meet you      And maybe yesterday   Was a day that I could get away   Now today I'm stuck in sanity   And I'm pleased to meet you      Right now I think I'm sane,   But I'm really just anxious   To cross that bridge   The subconscious oasis   Where right is right   And wrong is wrong   And you weren't there   To build me up      You get around   You want me   You come around   You need me   This time around   I won't be back at all      Maybe misery   Is what I need to keep my sanity   And I don't mean if things don't go my way   I'll be pleased to meet you (pleased to meet you)      And maybe yesterday   Was a day that I could get away   Now today I'm stuck in sanity   And I've seen it all   I've seen it all   Many times before      Maybe misery   Is what I need to keep my sanity   And I don't mean if things don't go my way   I'll be pleased to meet you      And maybe yesterday was a day that I could get away   Now today I'm stuck in sanity   And I've seen it all   I've seen it all   Many times before      Maybe misery (many times before)   Is what I need to keep my sanity (many times before)   And I don't mean if things don't go my way (many times before)   I'll be pleased to meet you (many times before)      And maybe yesterday (many times before)   Was a day that I could get away (many times before)   Now today I'm stuck in sanity (many times before)   And I've seen it all   I've seen it all   Many times before.Since we've met   I... Am... Me..Sally, free and easy,   That should be her name."
"Dear @CAPS1, I beleave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on peope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that atleast @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people.

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology was grown exponetially during the last few years. The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I beleive this is not somthing to be excited about. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. The ove useage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure. Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healty, only use the computer when it's absolutely neccesary. Going on all the time can seperate you from others. This g eneration, adolecents especailly, use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family. Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can became a non-important thing. People can't pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing, even nature. Humans started out living i nthe wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting. Our connection with nature was strong. We needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People do not appreciated nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1. com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when neccesary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside..Maybe I hang around here   Little more than I should   Both know I got somewhere else to go   But I got something to tell you   That I never thought I would   But I believe you really ought to know      I love you   I honestly love you   You don't have to answer   I see it in your eyes   Maybe it was better left unsaid   This is pure and simple   And you must realize   That it's coming from my heart and not my head      I love you   I honestly love you   I'm not tryin' to make you feel uncomfortable   I'm not tryin' to make you anything at all   But this feeling doesn't come along everyday   And you shouldn't blow the chance   When you've got the chance to say   I love you (i love you)   I honestly love you      If we both were born in another place and time   This moment might be ending with a kiss   There you are with yours   And here I am with mine   So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this   I love you   I honestly love you   I honestly, love you      I love you.In the book of my life   Till the day that it's through   You know most of the pages belong to you   Every interesting chapter      Every twist, every turn   You're

the daily news      I will always need your love   It would be very hard to fill your shoes   I will always need your love   So many ways that I depend on you      I will always need your love   No one else, no one else, could love me like you   You know all of my faults   Every strength, every quirk      You can dictate a handbook on the way that I work   Many towering hurdles   You've helped

write it in the daily news   I will always need your love   It would be very hard to fill your shoes   I will always need your love      So many ways that I depend on you   I will always need your love   No one else, no one else, could love me like you   I will always need your love      Wish I could write it in the daily news   I will always need your love   It would be very hard to fill your

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a world without computers. I picture it as a better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world better. Computers @MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer having computers or no? In my opinion people would be better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers is one factor to blame with the @LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy. If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in @LOCATION2 will as well. If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 says ""if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them"" @CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue. In my opinion the citizens of @LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their. more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly when your on your computer all day you don't realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals. Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more, computer should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer. @CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least your social life could improve if people werent on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would be better off without computers. I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise, enjoy for nature, also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from. There is no need for a computer in your life, but don't speak for everyone. The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good..If she shows now, yo, there she blows now,   It just may be chunky Clementine..I know You are near      All of my days   I live for You, Lord   Establish my path   There's one thing I ask   That I may dwell in Your house forever   Lifting up Your name   Dwell in Your house forever more      That I may dwell in Your house forever   Lifting up Your name   Dwell in Your house forever more      Holy Spirit, have Your way   Sweet anointing teach our hearts   Our lives, we pray      That I may dwell in Your house forever   Lifting up Your name   Dwell in Your house forever more      That I may dwell in Your house forever   Lifting up Your name   Dwell in Your house forever more      That I may dwell in Your house forever   Lifting up Your name   Dwell in Your house forever more.It was the only card in the deck that I had left to play      And I'll say it again, I need a brand new friend   And I'll say it

noone to miss us,   On our own,   Out in the cold,      Trudging onward,   Braving a harsh winter storm,   You and I met passing by,   And now our spirits feel warm,   I don't have anyone at home,   To talk to,   And you don't have anything to do,   So I'll spend my Christmas with you,      I'll spend my Christmas,      It's Christmas,   And we are in love,   With the way that the soft snowflakes kiss us,   From far above,   The blustery breeze,      Trudging onward,   Braving a harsh winter storm,   You and I met passing by and now our spirits feel warm,      I believe,   That Jesus is truly the only way,   And I celebrate,   Christmas because it's his birthday,      I don't have anyone at home to talk to,   And you don't have anything to do,   So I'll spend my Christmas with you,      I'll spend my Christmas with you,   I'll spend my Christmas with you,   I'll spend my Christmas with you..So close, no matter how far   Couldn't be much more from the heart   Forever trusting who we are   No, nothing else matters.This song is also dedicated to all the kids living in this society   Who are being deprived of their basis rights,   The right to a peaceful home,   The right to an

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now..And then on our year planners, it's the raising of the banners,   And it's only polite manners, to kill more guys..[Chorus]   Tell me again was it love at first sight   When I walked by and you caught my eye..I'll soon be with you my love,   To give you my dawn surprise..Big Sur I've got plans for you   Me and mine are going to   Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers   (Big Sur mount)      And live in canyons covered in springtime green   Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen   And with my old guitar   I'll make up songs to sing..Of Jesus sing and Maria..Sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)   Boys!.I don't know how to say no   And after three or four,   I was on the floor,   Singing my song,   La la la   No no..Waits in her platforms for the right song to come..Yes he said that's right son!.Skies of gray are not today..I'm putting on my Sunday suit and I'm goin' downtown   But I'll be kissin' your lips before the sun goes down      Ain't that loving you baby?.Livin' high   On Central Drive (He's on Central Drive!).But burning in my heart   My memory smolders on   Of the gunners dying words on the intercom..[Chorus:]   I got a heat wave   Burning in my heart   I can't keep from crying   Tearing me apart      Sometimes she calls my name   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't explain      I feel, yeah I feel   I feel this burning flame   This high blood pressure's got a hold on me   'Cause this is the way love's supposed to be      [Chorus]      Oh yeah   Oh yeah      Oh yeah   Oh yeah      Just give me another chance   This could be a new romance      Heat wave   Heat wave   Heat wave   Heat wave.Buy a big bright green pleasure machine..Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry..(And she said)   Take me now   I'm hungry for your loving   (And she said)   Show me how   You got me working, honey   (And she said)   Right now   I'm hot just like an oven   (And she said)   So take me now   Boy you make me feel like I gotta dance      I gotta dance, gotta dance baby, I gotta dance      I feel good to you, you try to hide it   And I can tell by the way you push up close to me   Your body temperature, is arising   Something's going down as far as I can see      Just let me take the lead   All you gotta do is let your mind be free   Lets hit the floor and cause a scene   Get real wet if you know what I mean   What you say baby?.What have you got to lose   What the hell   What is you think you're gonna find?.How long will I love you   As long as there are stars above you   And longer if I can      How long will I need you   As long as the seasons need to   Follow their plan      How long will I be with you   AS long as the sea is bound to   wash upon the sand      How long will I want you   As long as you want me to   And longer by far      How long will I hold you   As long as your father told you   As long as you are      How long will I give to you   As long as I live to you   However long it you say      How long will I love you   As long as are stars above you   And longer if I may.Yeah, I've got everything, everything but you..While we get peanuts   She's livin' fat!"
"I think that people shouldnt use the computer's that much because it make's you want to be on it and on it day. Like yea you can play games on it and talk to people like other people you use of lec see I can understand that but the other people around you like that live's with you people that on the computer all day can spend time with there family and friends and to other places then going to look at them on the computer's I mean like to see other people that you see on the computer like chat or like webcam on the computer, you can maybe go see in a other state and go visited them. then being on the computer people that always on the computer should get out because there never going to do things is they are always on the computer, like when @CAPS1 on the computer @CAPS1 on it for a hour are so the I do things with family and friends, but not all the time that @CAPS1 on it, like i understand if you work on the computer at work and then finishing things at home for your work, but once in a you get to spend some time with family and friends, not @CAPS4 be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and @CAPS4 go on the computer and that how people get lazy the start getting fat because they @CAPS4 go on the it and maybe stop to eat and back on the computer, then when they get off of it they will eb all tierd and stuff not feeling like going anywere @CAPS4 to sleep or like if they had sometimes to do after they would be all lazy an not wanted to do anything at all, that why people should get out more and do thing withe there family and friends to have fun withe there like..There's a question   Ringing out a clear loud question   It's a question   Giving you one in the head, it's a question      Do you have an answer, theologian?.Before all secrets are revealed old scars must heal or wither   But it's getting very late and I can't wait anymore   Are we gonna go the whole way this time   Do you want to go the whole way this time?.What do I do now?.I'm just curious   Without all this attention   You'd die   I'd die   We'd die (Wouldn't we baby)      And if I live to be a hundred and one   I will never understand what you are   (I'm talking to you)   You're looking for sympathy from people who work to eat   And they don't really seem to mind      I said maybe your mama gave you up boy   (It's the same old same old)   I said maybe baby your daddy didn't love you enough girl      How much is enough?.Late last night, we were right   Into some exotic scene..Tie it up!.Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground   Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground   Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground   Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground!.To get it together once and forever   Just get it together, once, once and forever, ay      Say people, are you ready?.Five minutes in the closet with you..Thou and I will see him dine   When we bear the thither..Cat's eye, apple pie, what am I going to do,   The woman I loved walked out on me,   What am I going to do..Listen Mr. DJ   Won't you play me something slow   Play me the songs   For the lonely ones   Play me something   That I know      Hey Mr. DJ   I'm in a sad mood tonight   Play me something just for me and my baby   Won't you make everything alright      I'm gonna turn it way down low   Leave it on all night long   Till the morning comes   Like my lover my friend until the end   And that special someone      Hey Mr. DJ   Play me Rainbow 66   Cause I'm drifting like a ship out on the fog   And I just don't know what's coming next      Gonna turn it way down low   Leave it on all night long   Until the morning comes   For my lover my friend until the end   And that special someone      Hey Mr. DJ   Play me Rainbow 66   Cause I'm drifting like a ship out on the sea   And I just don't know what's coming next      Well, Mr. DJ   I'm in a sad mood tonight   Play me something for me and my darling   Want you to make everything   Alright      La, ta..Flash, a-ah, saviour of the universe   Flash, a-ah, he'll save everyone of us   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha   Flash, a-ah, he's a miracle   Flash, a-ah, king of the impossible      He's for everyone of us   Stand for everyone of us   He'll save with a mighty hand   Every man, every woman   Every child, with a mighty flash   Flash, a-ah   Flash, a-ah, he'll save everyone of us      Just a man   With a man's courage   He knows nothing but a man   But he can never fail   No one but the pure in heart   May find the golden grail   Oh oh, oh oh   Flash..I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with the black hair   And my head shouted down to my heart   ""you better look out below!"".You're the only God they know      What are you running from   Wasn't this enough   Aren't you satisfied?.So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun   In a glade through the trees I saw my only one   Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun   The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing..What in the world's come all over me?.I don't see me in your eyes anymore,   oh why can't I make them shine as before?.O beautiful for spacious skies,   For amber waves of grain,   For purple mountain majesties   Above the fruited plain!.Give me your love   You got it all sown up   And your beats so very   I could never get enough, baby   You got the good stuff, good stuff      [Chorus]      Cupid Boy   Cupid Boy   Cupid Boy   Cupid Boy      I could never get enough   You've got the good stuff, good stuff      [Chorus].Do you really want to know my life?"
"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 society should have computers because it teaches you things that a school or job will never teach you, and it allows you to be in contact with your friends and family that you don't see a lot. I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @CAPS1 society should have computers. First, we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before. I say this because if you wanna know about the @LOCATION1 more and the school or job doesn't teach you as much as you wanna know, then all you have to do is look up on the internet and theres a chance you gonna find it. @NUM1 people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 society because we could contact people online that we heven't spoke to. My opinion is that if you haven't to a friend or family member in a while you can talk to them online. Also, if they don't have a phone or if they do but it's long distance and you can't talk to long distance on your phone, you can tlak to them on or email each other, etc. Sample say if your phone isn't working and the only thing that's working is your computer you to it in contact with somebody. All you gotta do is talk to them online. Would you rather talk on the phone or computer. In conclusion, @CAPS1 society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people. I would like for you to aprreciate my concern on having computers in @CAPS1 society..She was a wide eyed girl   In a purple dress   She could have been good   She could have been the best   Shy little

pull somebody through it   And to this day so many say   ""God, why'd you let him do it?"""
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I don’t think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldn’t you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldn’t get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldn’t get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society..Shout out tuh mayhem..Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that   Just remember that, hey      [Chorus]   I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama, no)   I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama (I ain't your mama, hey)   I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama   When you're gon' get your act together?.[Verse 1]   Different inflection when you say my name   Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same   Is it real or am I going out of my mind?.Here I go, falling down, down, down,   My mind is a blank,   My head is spinning around and around,   As I go deep into the funnel of love,   Deep into the funnel of love,   Deep into the funnel of love..I can't dance, I can't sing   I'm just standing here selling   Oh and checking everything is in place   You never know who's looking on   A perfect body with a perfect face      Mmm Hmmm      No I can't dance, I can't talk..I don't' know why it should be so hard   Givin' up this circle dance   Worn out steps from long ago   Don't give love a chance   It's a bitter heirloom handed down   These twisted parts we play      I'm not her and you're not him   It just comes out that way   Can't go back to make things right   Though I wish I'd understood   Time has made things clearer now   We did the best we could      I'll be home soon, that's what you'd say   And a little kid believes   After a while I learned that love   Must be a thing that leaves   I tried so hard just to hold you near   Was as good as I could be      Even when I had you here   You stayed so far from me   Can't go back to make things right   Though I wish I'd understood   Time has made things clearer now      You did the best you could   Now that this has occurred to me   I just wanted you to know   I've been too faithful all my life   It's time to let you go.Girl, tell me how could I ever forget      There, you were standing there..Tv makes a star, a superstar and it makes your dream come true   Tv makes you laugh and makes you cry, do it just for you      Don't be so sad, you're not the one   There's another chance for you, keep holing on, oh yeah   Just take your time and you will see   You can win it if you want, oh just like me   You need something to live for, every single day   I'll keep my fingers crossed, you'll find your way, oh yeah      Tv makes it, tv even breaks it   Tv makes the superstar where ever you are, oh yeah   Tv makes it, tv even breaks it   Tv makes the superstar, sometimes it's so hard      Tv makes a star, makes a superstar, shows you crazy life   Tv takes you hight and takes you low, will your hope survive?.I had to say it twice   Swagger so nice..There are four Evermore,   Radio stations,   Everywhere that we go..Tortured and

"Computers can be very useful to people. They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet. If you had a friend or family member move away, computers are an easy way to contact them. Phones dont always give you that option to call from around the world. Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers. What if you want to chat with someone right next door even if theres a blizzard and the snow is four feet, computers are a simple way to contact them. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 for the @DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all? Imagine you, writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday. Typing is an easy solution that doesnt require as much work and it takes less time. Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read. Not even a library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library wont immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully? You cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport. You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 it upon google"" when they dont know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog, I never even heard of. When I got home I went on the internet and researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and its fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper..[Bleeping]   [Mr Spindel:] ""I'm gonna hang up!"".I'm all about it (brrrr!!!).Chorus:   Yes, you really need a saviour   Somehow you've known it all along   Yes, you really need a saviour   You know you've heard it for so long   Yes, You really need a saviour   Someone to come and lead you on   You need a saviour   You need a saviour   It's time      Told yourself today just for your own sake   What was lost wouldn't cost anyway   Life's a one night stand, this time you'll win   The up and down, life-long game that you play..When you tried to kiss me   I only bit your tongue..And I don't have anything to share   That I won't throw away into the air..I let go,   There's just no one that gets me like you do   You are my only,   My only one..lost   I'm l.o.s.t..So I'm gonna tell you goodbye,   Don't mind these tears there in my eyes   Cause I ain't gonna love you any more      My darlin' I just worship you,   And look what you have loved me through..(woowoo)   Hangin' out with redneck truck drivers   Instead of always givin' each other piledrivers   I see my old homey, he died in a drag   Chillin with two bitches, ""What up, Shaggs?"".I.   Ooh..For all the wisdom of a lifetime, no one can ever tell..It's all gone wrong, give me time..Well the gallery went wild, and the auctioneer half smiled,   What we don't sell we shoot or give away,   'Cause the more you pay, the more it's worth..I hear the rain..Everyone asks what you're doing with me   I know this is not what they want   They're afraid you've been blinded   But I already know how it's going to be   If anyone should ask   Say we're mated   For as long as this life lasts   We are mated   Why else would you be here right now   And you know we'll still be here tomorrow   Nobody else understands what I'm doing   Nobody else makes me act in this way   And because they can't comprehend   What we mean to each other   They won't leave you alone   So you know what to say   I hold you in my heart   'Cause we're mated   In a very special part   We are mated   Why else would I be here right now   And you know I'll still be here tomorrow   I see things far ahead, maybe light   Maybe beautiful children   I don't have words I'm thinking of   But it's way beyond what they call love.Aha, what a lovely way to burn..Go on, go on, go on, if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come   Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?.And I wanted him to teach me and I needed to believe..Oh, no!.can we take   I'll let you know when the medication wears off      I'm a religious drunk   And this is where I pray      We're a church of alcoholics   Can't bring up the congregation      Give us air to breathe through carbonation   We are at the good church and your feltching on bar stools      We're praying that the tabs will keep the holy water flowing   He keeps a communion and a long night of confessions      Coming home after noon seems to raise a lot of questions   When in Minnesota and you've got a drinking quota.No, noooo ...

"To my opinion computers have a negative effect on people I think it has a negative because it causes people to get less exercise you spend less time with your family and friends and it distracts you from things get done. First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games practicingg these they will just computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done. WIthout even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college those things include getting out around, but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends. i went over my I sat right and she didn't even look at me playing computer games. i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer. Lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them. It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because, they are absorbent in they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're budy playing game or surfing the web. i know that if I did I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because, it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people, as much, and it distract them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less those on the computer!.Cleveland rocks!.maybe you had too much too fast..Who's that falling into love, who?.She said what

"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change..the herald angels sing   ""Glory to the newborn King!"".Well I am through with suffering      Gonna make better choices I don't need no wedding ring      I can sing, I can dance      But I can't make thus feeling cease      Cause deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and         We all got our cross to bear      Our Star of David, our dreadlocked hair      And oh yeah baby, I still care      And if you need some help      You know I'll always be there         Well it's been a strange year      You've been a very bad dog      As my fire went out      You'd put on another log      But it was worth never having any peace      And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and         Repeat chorus         Some nights I thought I'd cry forever      I'd wish him away and then I'd turn into a beggar      But it was worth always scraping my knees      And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease         I wear my heart like a wrinkle on my sleeve         And I've got the aching love that only you can relieve      But I'm not afraid to go down with a sinking friend      I'm gonna live out my dreams even if they kill me in the end         Repeat chorus.I hate long goodbyes, fuck off and die   You can bury my heart with your box of lies   Cut me down to size, it's no surprise   You can stab me in the back and then cut all ties      Gimme an ""F"", gimme a ""U""   Gimme a ""CK YOU""   Read between the lines, I guess love is blind   Want me to spell it out for you?.I never thought   That anyone   Was more important than the plans   I made   But now I feel the shame   There's no one else to blame   For all the broken hearts scattered on the field of war      [Chorus:]      Sometimes I let you go   Sometimes I hurt you sooo!.Hey buddy, I want to talk to you   About (I got?).December isn't always cold   But this year she's mine and I know why   Somewhere a flower has to grow   For every flower that dies   I'm stricken with fever   But my heart is strong as steel   I'm ready to go anywhere!.You know the feeling   When adrenaline takes control   Can't beat the rush   That leaves a suicidal hold      Instinct spares no one   Destroying the human heart   The taste of blood   Can rip your soul apart      Devils that drive us   Do not discriminate   A state of mind   That becomes the ultimate end      Action reaction   Blood line is not immune   To the depth of human nature   Inside of me and you      A sociopath with empty eyes   And no soul   Paranoid psychotic heart of stone   My blood runs cold      Evils of passion   Can drive reason to extremes   Love hate and murder   Temporary insanity      On the edge of a   Demented personality   Emotional   Pain is a deadly reality      A sociopath with empty eyes   And no soul   Paranoid psychotic heart of stone   My blood runs cold      A choice is made of free will   Just like the choice to kill   Decisions to lose control   My self-destructive rationale      A choice is made, made of free will   Just like the choice, the choice to kill   In the speed of a moment   Life stands still now you're standing in my killing field      A choice is made of free will   Just like the choice to kill   In the speed of a moment   Life stands still now you're standing in my killing field.He is mighty..Should I keep hoping for love?.Demolition..Have you seen the little pieces of the people we have been?.Time is flying by us every day..Fine man, crazy man, he can't see..Well, I'm still hooked on Haggard..To be the prince of possession in the gallery of contempt   Suffering your indiscreet discretions and you ask me to relent   As you accumulate flirtations with the calculated calmness of the whore   I am the harlequin -

"Dear @CAPS1, You use a computer a lot right? Good if you @CAPS7 because @CAPS7 you beleive that experts are questioning why @CAPS5 use them a lot? Well I think people need them because its how @CAPS5 know whats going on in the world, its how @CAPS5 know how the weather is like so accidents can be avoided, and you you can flip on your @CAPS2.V., but than you have to wait for what you want to go on. So you decide @ORGANIZATION1, should @CAPS5 be outside more? Don’@CAPS2 you need to know whats going on too? Of course you @CAPS7, everyone does. I think that it is important that @CAPS5 know @CAPS4 a meteor is about to strike the world no? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets info. On whats going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? Don’@CAPS2 think so. Im @PERCENT1 sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn’@CAPS2 want to be known as the accident State. Well thats why @CAPS5 need the computer! For people to know if I will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic than @CAPS5 need to go to the internet to find out @CAPS4 and where and what time. CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says “@CAPS4 someone says ‘@CAPS5 might be getting some snow or rain’ than they usually go right to the internet ” You you can turn on your @CAPS2.V. to find out whats going on, but not all of it you will want/need to know. So you will have to wait. The internet just does it right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection) @CAPS7 you think these reasons are making a good argument? I @CAPS7. @CAPS7 you use your computer for finding out whats going on, what the weather is like, and instead of the @LOCATION2? If so I think you would aggree with me..Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!.Or maybe a frappucino?.May each petal be a memory of the happiness we knew,   Each thorn may tell a story of the heartache that I've been through,   So I'm sending you red roses although we're oceans apart,   And remember when they fade dear that you'll always have my heart..Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well..[Chorus:]   Got to have it,   Yeah I made it   I'm addicted      [Eminem - Verse 1]   This was a beat with no words at first, it's a blank painting   Exercising the mind, it's brain strength training   Starts off something like shady's an insane maniac   Yeah slim shady that's a zany name aint it   Now all you needs an image to go with the name, baby   Wife beaters and white t-shirts   Hanes mainly, it's a long shot but is it possible   There's a lane maybe,   If not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he   He wants the fame so bad he can taste it   He can see his name up in lights   Women screaming his f-cking name feinting   Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium   Joe Shmoe made it, he took his plain Jane lady   And his baby Hailey out the trailer   But he aint trailing anymore he's ahead of the race   While maintaining his innocence   Little does he know his train is derailing   And he's about to be raped by this game anally..Now or never..When you were down I always picked you up   Why didn't I recognize that everything was never fine?.Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!.What if I say I'm not like the others?.I know he's gonna love you, but I still want you back again,   'Cause baby you're part of me, it's deep inside of you..Chorus   With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,   Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,   But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,   And there's no salvation to be found..You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends      I let a song go out of my heart   Believe me, darlin', when I say   I won't know sweet music until you return some day      I let a song go out of my heart   Believe me, darlin', when I say   I won't know sweet music until you return some day.(Yea, yea..Changes come before we can grow..Baby there's no need to be naive, blindfolded..Where, grave, Thy victory?.I see a flame, I wanna get burned      [Chorus]   How can I blame you   For showin' up at the party?.What in the world did I do to deserve you   I don't understand why you treat me that way   You knew you were everything that I ever wanted   You had your own ways of makin' me pay      Then you took it just a little to far   Now I see you for what you are   I don't need the heartache anymore      Lovin' you was an endless fight   I was wrong and you were always right   But look what happened when I called your bluff   When the truth comes out   You aint' so tough - no      You turned me into an emotional prisoner   You hit me with words that cut to the bone - oh   Then you kissed me and made me believe that I needed you   And think I could never survive on my own - oh no      Never thought that I would break away   Now I see right through your power play   And I don't feel so helpless after all      Lovin' you was an endless fight   I was wrong and you were always right   But look what happened when I called your bluff   When the truth comes out   Hey, you aint' so tough      You took me too far to forgive it   That was your last mistake   That was your last mistake      Lovin' you was an endless fight   I was wrong and you were always right   But look what happened when I called your bluff   When the truth comes out   You aint' so tough   You take it all but you don't give back   You feel strong when the odds are stacked   There comes a time when enough's enough   When the truth comes out   You aint' so tough   You aint' so tough.Even when you break my toys,   You will always be my,   Little brothers,   'Cuz you're younger,   We're related, and you're boys..Make believe that he's not there?.Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?"
" I think that using computer is fine. Reason why I think you have family from far away. Instead of talking hearing voice on the phone. They can talk to each other but most of all see each other. Show cool thing you have that are new. When you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip. Computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car. You can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you. Also now you can buy food on internet and lots more. Saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money. Lots of dating sites to meet diffent people to go out and give your commets. Texting on facebook can let you save money by texting for free. Playing free online games with your friends. You can make website and you can watch movie and show online. There just a lot of thing you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside exercise but I agree with some expert. Lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. This techology people are big they don't go out more. They eat lots of food.

"Computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. Thanks to computer scientest have found cours for deseses, jobs have become easier and communication with friends or family have become afordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people on places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to phone without having to pay for anything. Is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could have them find afordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1 they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events. any costs. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. Computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up and now computers can be as big as a flat screen @CAPS1 and you can turn them on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now?.Why the sun?.And they join in the chorus of Nellie Kelly,   I love you!.I was alone and fancy free   Enjoying all my liberty      I met you, baby   Then things changed   I started acting   Oh, so strange      Do I like it, do I like it   Yes, I do      Well, every day I had a ball   I didn't have a care at all   And everything was just okay   Until you made me change my way      Do I like it, do I like it   Yes, I do      Like a schoolboy   Loves his cherry pie   You really move me   My, oh, my      You caught me, baby   I'm really hooked   No doubt about it   My goose is cooked      It won't be long before I hear   Her whisper softly in my ear   I love you, baby, yes, I do   And from now on   It's me and you      Do I like it, do I like it   Yes, I do      Like a schoolboy   Loves his cherry pie   You really move me   My, oh, my      You caught me, baby   I'm really hooked   No doubt about it   My goose is cooked      It won't be long before I hear   Her whisper softly in my ear   I love you, baby, yes, I do   And from now on   It's me and you      Do I like it, do I like it   Yes, I do.Oh, I never can say goodbye..All impenetrable youth..And if you're down looking like you're gonna drown....I said : ""I know I do""      He doesn't know....Well you're just in time to be too late I tried to but I couldn't wait   And now I've got another date so I won't be home no more   You're just in time to miss the boat so don't take off your hat and coat   Be on your way that's all she wrote cause I won't be home no more   I stood around a mouth or two and waited for your call   Now I'm too busy pitchin' woo so come around next fall   I stretched your name right off my slate and hung a sign on my front gate   You're just in time to be too late and I won't be home no more   [ guitar -

"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. From searching pictures and information for a school projects, watching videos of songs, friends, or tv shows that you love or wonna check up on. to looking at websites. Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously! ""Have you change your mind? have you listened closely?"" @CAPS3 so your life just become a whole lot easier, by using facebook, for social ability, @ORGANIZATION1 and windows programs for school, and google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer!.No other heart is truer then,   The one we call Canadian!.Cute..maybe you had too much too fast..You always thought that you were so cool   You used to say that I was a fool   And all this time you were just a tool   You couldn't see that I made the rules..Puttin on the ritz..Chorus:   Feels like rain   Feels like I'll never fall in love again   There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way   And it feels like rain today   Taking down every picture   Hanging on every wall   Broken dreams, painfull memories   Like the times I never listened   And the times I didn't try   It's gotta be the weather   'Cause you're not here with me   Chorus:   Feels like rain   Feels like I'll never fall in love again   There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way   And it feels like rain today   Regretting every minute   Since I watched you walk away   Cause it's not the same without you   And now the clouds are hiding   Every sunny day   I guess I'll stay inside again   Cause it feels like rain today   Feels like rain   Feels like we'll never fall in love again   There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way   And the clouds are hiding every sunny day   And the storm is coming so I'm here to stay   'Cause it feels like rain today   Yes, it feels like rain today.oh!.I just ate my first dead body last week,   Still got the fingernail caught in my teeth..Hidden in the mountains   Under the earth and stone   A cubic mile of perfection   A treasure no one has known      One man came upon this mother load   Built himself a thousand room chateau      He's the emperor of diamonds   Master of the prize   He's got a hold on happiness   And all that money can buy      Everyday he lives in fascination   This is not an everyday temptation      It was a diamond as big as the Ritz   What you gonna do with this, tell me   Who's gonna save you when your a slave to   The diamond as big as the Ritz      A blessing can become a curse   If you keep it to yourself   Your own exaggeration   Is not so good for your health      It's the prophecy of the unattainable dream   If you take one look behind the shine   It doesn't always gleam      Everyday he lives in fascination   This is not an everyday temptation      It way a diamond as big as the Ritz   What you gonna do with this   Who's gonna save you when your a slave to   The diamond as big as the Ritz      Coal under pressure   Sparkle of treasure   Crystalline measure   Ornamental pleasure   In the corner of your eye   Make a grown man cry   All the seeds you've sown      Greed can crumble castle walls   Greed can purchase you thrills   Power is a dangerous thing   It can maim it can kill      It's the prophecy of the unattainable dream   If you take one look behind the shine   It doesn't always gleam      It was a diamond as big as the Ritz   What you gonna do with this   Who's gonna save you when your a slave to   The diamond as big as the Ritz      It was a diamond as big as the Ritz   What you gonna do with this, tell me   Who's gonna save you when you're a slave to   The diamond as big as the Ritz.Now, the cold wind   blows out my candles..Oh, you're too afraid to touch   Too afraid you'll like it too much   The roads, the times, breaking up your mind   Can't you hear this beauty in life?.By Geof Johnson      The very best part of Halloween   Is getting more candy than you've ever seen..Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar..Yes, I'm sure it will work out alright..Ugh...

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about computers is that they benifet people. they help people when they need it, it gives people entertainment. So that is why computers benifet people. @CAPS1 first reason is that a computer can help people when they need help like for instace if you have to write a paper and you need to look something up such as reseach you can use the computer or if there is a long main cwayshion then you can look up the formula. So as you can see that is why computer benifts people @CAPS1 second resson is that it gives people entertainment, such as myspace, you twitter. And those are social networks, if you like to watch tv. or listen to music there are websites for them also. So that is why I said computers give you entertainmen too. @CAPS1 third resson is that it helps people such as if you in different contries and you can't go see them you to them through instans or web cam. Or if you are home schooled and you dnt see other kids your age that can talk to the on the computer. So as you can see that why I say you can through the computer. So as you can see that is why I say computer are very benifical be cause they give you entertainment they let you communicate and they help people so..Let's get ready for this..You've got it made, you've got real love   Something you don't find every day   Someone to trust, someone to lean on   Something I would hold onto if I were you      You've got it made, you've got no one   You don't have those strings to tie you down   You come and go free as the wind blows   I wouldn't settle down too soon if I were you      If I were you, I'd be satisfied   Oh, I'm sure the grass is greener on the other side   If I were you, I'd stay by her side (I'd be running wild)   I would never leave her   That's what I would do   If I were you      If I were you, I'd be satisfied   Oh, I'm sure the grass is greener on the other side   If I were you, would I rather be (would I rather be)   Someone just like me?.If you can't dig on Esther, you turn and leave town   'cause if you think she's bad you ought to see her sister..Mark Knopfler)      A million miles our vagabond heels   Clocked up beneath the clouds   They're counting down to show time   When we do it for real with the crowds   Air miles are owing   But they don't come for free   And they don't give you any for pain      But if it's all for nothing   All the roadrunning's   Been in vain      The rimshots come down like cannon fire   And thunder off the wall   There's a man in every corner   And each one is giving his all      This is my fife   This is my drum   So you never will hear me complain      And if it's all for nothing   All the roadrunning's   Been in vain      All the roadrunning   All the roadrunning      Well if you're inclined   To go up on the wall   It can only be fast and high   And those who don't like the danger   Soon find something different to try   When there's only a ringin' in your ears   And an echo down memory lane      But if it's all for nothing   All the roadrunning's   Been in vain      All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning   All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning      The show's packing up   I sit and watch the convoy   Leaving town   There's no pretending I'm not a fool,   For riding around and around   Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death   You showed me one time on the plane      But if it's all for nothing   All the roadrunning's   Been in vain      A million miles of vagabond sky   Clocked up above the clouds   I'm still your man for the roaming   For as long as there's roamin' allowed      There'll be a rider   And there'll be a wall   As long as the dreamer remains      And if it's all for nothing   All the roadrunning's   Been in vain      All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning   All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning   All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning   All the roadrunning, all the roadrunning.Your first patient (yeah)   Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)   Originality (ugh)   His flow is weak (another one)   And he has no style (ugh)   What'cha got for um?.Seems my destiny, Captain Fantasy   So take a minute to go down beneath the reaches of sound   You could be with me, Captain Fantasy   Captain Fantasy.So clear to see you've had all your chances with me..Tarot woman, I don't know   I don't know   I don't know   Hey, I don't know.I was folding up your letters   Unpacking winter clothes   Searching for my hat   I thought I left it by the door   So I tore around the room   Like a bird without a head   I saw your picture waving back at me   From underneath the bed   From a long, long time ago      When all I had   Was a hat full of stars   The one I'll always treasure   The one that you wore   You loved the look   But you never looked inside   You would have seen us there   You could've seen far   You should've seen the magic   In my hat full of stars      I'm trying to live in the present   But I keep tripping on the past   Finding out reality, well clarity   Comes in dribs and drabs   No we never had the time   For everything we had   So it felt like we had nothing   That's what makes this hat so sad   It was a long, long time ago      When all we had   Was a hat full of stars...

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. ""You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond. (did not finish).When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name   Yes, when I first met you babe, I didn't even know your name   I was feeling so low on the ground   Bad luck and evil women

knew true love had come to me   Yeah      Take my hand, baby, now, you hold it tight and don't let go   Take my hand, now, hold it tight and don't let go   Yes, 'cause our love is like a merry go round   And 'round forever it's gonna go.!.There are times when I feel like nothing's been achieved   Torn by indecision, it's not hard to believe it   That all of our hopes and all of our dreams

"Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming to dependant on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active. While some people @MONTH1 think were not wasting our time on the computer. I @CAPS3. I'll should only go on if it is nessesary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people dont realize is that is doesent only waste there time in waste our money too. Electricys bills are trough the roughtAlso instead og going out to meet @CAPS1 people are staying home and talking on social networking sites which make them less social. Children are not enrolling in sports which makes them losse any physical strength they would get. Also children could be getting over wait by just sitting there with no pysical activitys, @CAPS2 ideas like microsoft word is fine but going on every day for games is. Teachers, parent, and all need to show these that the computer is not the only thing, Computers can benifit us very well, by letting us have knoledge of somthing at the tip of our fingers. Computers can and will take away family and friend time. Now im not saying that computer but what am saying is that it effects everyone around you, @CAPS3 just the person thats using it. What @CAPS4 need to @CAPS3 is get together and unite. @CAPS4 need to go outside more, and exersise. @CAPS4 need to stop the computer with adults. Therfore, lets make this a better place. and get out and have a little time for going on to the computer..I don't talk like I used to talk,   He made the difference..Seems you got me feelin' like you want me to   Fade   But it's all right, how we'll be   Nothing that you want from me   Fade      And I know that I'll fall in too deep   And you'll wait till I fall asleep   Before you fade away, fade away   And I know that it won't take too long   Before you go and find something wrong   And fade away, fade away   And I know that I'll fall in too deep   And you'll wait till I fall asleep   Before you fade away, fade away      I'm heavy on my knees, yeah   I'm heavy on my knees, yeah   I'm heavy on, I'm heavy on   I'm heavy on my knees, yeah.Gasping for another breath..Hear, once again in your ear, babe!.On a carousel, on a carousel,   round and round and round and round   round and round and round and round with you..Hey you, you're a child in my head   You haven't walked yet   Your first words have yet to be said   But I swear you'll be blessed      I know you're still just a dream   your eyes might be green   Or the bluest that I've ever seen   Anyway you'll be blessed      And you, you'll be blessed   You'll have the best   I promise you that   I'll pick a star from the sky      Pull your name from a hat   I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that   You'll be blessed      I need you before I'm too old   To have and to hold   To walk with you and watch you grow   And know that you're blessed.A bright array of city lights as far as I can see   The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me   The cabarets and honky-tonks their flashing signs invite   A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights..She stands before you naked   You can see it, you can taste it   But she comes to you   Light as the breeze   You can drink or you can nurse it   It don't matter how you worship   As long as you're   Down on your knees      So I knelt there at the delta   At the alpha and the omega   At the cradle of the river   And the seas   And like a blessing come from heaven,   For something like a second,   I was healed, and my heart   Was at ease      O baby I waited   So long for your kiss   For something to happen   Oh, something like this      And you're weak and you're harmless   And you're sleeping in your harness   And the wind's going wild   In the trees   And it's not exactly prison   But you'll never be forgiven   For whatever you've done   With the keys      O baby I waited   So long for your kiss   For something to happen   Oh, something like this      It's dark and it's snowing   Oh my love I must be going   The river is starting to freeze   And I'm sick of pretending   I'm broken from bending   I've lived too long   On my knees      And she dances so graceful   And your heart's hard and hateful   And she's naked   But that's just a tease   And you turn in disgust   From your hatred and from your love   And she comes to you   Light as the breeze      O baby I waited   So long for your kiss   For something to happen   Oh, something like this      There's blood on every bracelet   You can see it, you can taste it   And it's please baby   Please baby please   And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim   But don't forget there's still a woman   Beneath this   Resplendent chemise      So I knelt there at the delta   At the alpha and omega   I knelt there   Like one who believes   And like a blessing come from heaven   For something like a second   I was cured, and my heart   Was at ease      O baby I waited   So long for your kiss   For something to happen   Oh, something like this.I've got my beer..All of my time   I'll spend in fascination..Can you bring it all back to me?.My heart

every night   Fall to the ground and I wake up   So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head   Thoughts fly back to the breakup      These four wall are closing in   Look at the fix you put me in      Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it   Could I be wrong   But since you been gone   You cast your spell so break it   Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh   Since you been gone      So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light   I read the words that you sent to me   I can take the afternoon, the night time comes around   too soon   You can't know what you mean to me      Your poison letter, your telegram   Just goes to show you don't give a damn      Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it   Could I be wrong   But since you been gone   You cast your spell so break it   Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh   Since you been gone      If you will come back   Baby, you know you'll never do wrong      Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it   Could I be wrong   But since you been gone   You cast your spell so break it   Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh   Ever since you been gone      Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it   Since you been gone   Since you been gone   I'm out of my head can't take it.Auh hah hah..Dream, dream dream dream, dream, dream dream

"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you know that eight out of ten homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. For others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. The computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a @NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, @ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw. So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curiouse about the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2, if I wanted more inofrmartion @CAPS3 head straight to the computer. You simply go to @ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty. The computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways, wether it is communication organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life. Computers don't just benifit our little town of @LOCATION1, they benifit our whole socoety in all of the amazing things they do. .Uhh, come on   Get up      On the Left, On the Left, left, right left

"@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online..He's a model citizen   Just keep believing that my friends   I'm a model citizen?.It could all be so simple   But you'd rather make it hard   Loving you is like a battle   And we both end up with scars   Tell me, who I have to be   To get some reciprocity   No one loves you more than me   And no one ever will      Is this just a silly game   That forces you to act this way?.Those who are a waste of life   Use up air that others could breathe   Human leaches all around   Looking superion is what they believe      Fake is the word you represent   Your existence on earth I resent   At the cost of others you get by   Each word that you speak is a lie      Low life   That's all you'll ever be   Lies in effect   That's what you like to see      Hiding behind material values   That help cover up your weakness   Never to change, always to look   For an easy way out of life      A pathetic excuse for a human being      Nothing to back you up, never giving second thought   Thinking you fool the world, into seeing something you are not      Fake is the word you represent   Your existence on earthj I resent   At the cost of others you get by   Each word that you speak is a lie      Low life   That's all you'll ever be   Lies in effect   That's what you like to see.Outrageous, when I'm at a party..Fuck it, yes I will,   I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real   Put it to you like      [Chorus]      Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,   Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,   That gangsta recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,   Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,   Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,   I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this iBomb,   I palm the game like its a Splading ball and take flight,   From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike   Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this goin' be a great night,   Look at all these posers bite, our swagger like a great white,   Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,   Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,   This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long,   The best that ever did it an doin' it on a new song,   U-G-K an Young Money too strong   Bound to be in the green like a crouton,   So what the fuck is you on?.Well I'm hoping, I'm dreamin', I'm prayin'   I know what you're thinkin'   See what you're seein'   Never ever let yourself go      Hold yourself down, hold yourself down   Why d'ya hold yourself down?.Hey!.Slip, you fall, I pick you up and dust you off,   You break my heart..Drip, drip, drip   Baby, when'd you get so Zen?.Ev'rybody's yearnin' for somebody else   But nobody's lonesome for me   Ev'rybody's fallin' for somebody else   But nobody's fallin' for me   Now I ain't had a kiss since I fell out of my crib   It looks to me like I been cheated out of my rib   Ev'rybody's lonesome for somebody else   No-bod-o-dy lonesome for me..They're starting to open up the sky   They're starting to reach down through   And it feels like we're living in that split-second of a car crash   And time is slowing down   And if we only had a little more time   And this time is all there is      Do you remember the time we...

"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend to much time on their computers. I belive people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death. First of all there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer to much. When they are out with their family they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a non-stop amount of time. In a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say, ""I had one child come into @CAPS3 office and he had the hardest time seeing"". He asked the kids mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, ""@CAPS3 son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses aare really expensive. I have read about children and adults deing from using the computer to much. They have fried their brain from using the computer to much. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking in homes, killing people, and high sacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you trun your computer off so that you are not temted to go back on it..Don't leave me tonight (oh baby not tonight)   Don't leave me tonight (I can't take it this time)   Don't leave me tonight (Oh no no no)      He don't love you half as much as I do,   Promise you'll stay the night, and love me too..All I hear is muthafucker's talkin' sucotash   Livin' large, tellin' me to

in that Audrey Hepburn hat   It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that   She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes   Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom   And

you so      But when ye come and all the flowers are dying   If I am dead and dead I well may be   You'll come and find the place where I am lying   And kneel and say an 'Ave' there for me      And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me   And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be   For you will bend and tell me that you love me   And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me.Fall to your knees bring on the rapture,   Blessed be the boys time can't capture..Down your throat I'm never sure if it's still you..Instrumental   I've been from Spain to Tokyo, from Africa to Ohio,   I never try to

One thing baby never make a move too soon   Yeah baby, never make your move too soon,   Well you can count on this baby, we never make a move too soon   (Too soon).Cover of Pixies song played in Texas

the divorce   And there was one thing I wanted to tell you darlin' darlin'   Before the music stops for me and you and that's what you meant to me   And even thought the divorce is final now   I wanted to sing you this one last love song      Your precious love means more to me than any love could ever be   For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue   For that's what love will do   And darlin' (I'm so surprised) oh when I first realized   That you weren't fooling me   And darlin' they say that our love won't grow   But I just want to tell them that they don't know   For as long as you're in love with me our love will grow wider depper than any sea   And of all the things all the things that I want in this whole wide world   Is just for you to say that you'll be my girl   Oooh (wanting you) I'm wanting you (I'm so blue) oh that's what live will do      I gave it a hundred and ten percent of my soul   And I tried everything I could to hold it together   But now that it's over I just wanted you to know   That anytime you have sunshine you're gonna have bad weather   Some people they can handle that and some people can't   Just for the record another chapter in my life   And you were that chapter just divorced   Maybe they should write that on my tombstone darlin'   Would that make you happy then   Your precious love means more....Well I drink, and I stink, I smoke, yeah I'm a joke   I try all night and day to get a piece of the action, a-haa   And you should know by now you're never gonna forget, a-aaa   Now I know just what you're thinkin'   It could be out 'n' you're drinkin'   So don't you knock it until you try it   It could be you in a little while   I hope I didn't ruin your day   It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood   And I dig your wife, she sure is good   It's a beautiful day in the neighboorhood.I find a reason to survive when I'm too old..Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you   You have made me what I am and I am yours   My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you   Let me hold you in my arms forever more      You have gone and made me such a fool   I'm so lost in your love   And oh, we belong together   Won't you believe in my song?.Speaking dayglow red,   Explode-o pink, purple mountain's majesty   Show me you, I'll show you me."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us regularly? Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computer allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also website such as mapquest & yellowpages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleages instantly. What one does, is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are ease for our everyday life. So, don't spent your life on the computer but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine. Stop writing on that pad, get up and type it on your computer!.Did I really want you gone?.[Jethro Tull]      In the shuffling madness   Of the locomotive breath   Runs the all time loser   Headlong to his death   And he feels the piston scraping   Steam breaking on his brow   Old Charlie stole the handle   And the train, it won't stop going   No way to slow down, oh      He sees his children jumping off   At stations one by one   His woman and his best friend   In bed and having fun   And oh, he's crawling down the corridor   On his hands and knees   Old Charlie stole the handle   And the train, it won't stop going   No way to slow down, oh   No way to slow down      He hears the silence howling   When he catches angels as they fall   And the all time winner   Has got him by the balls   Oh, and he picks up Gideon's Bible   And it's open at page one   I think God, he stole the handle   And the train, it won't stop going      No way to slow down   No way to slow down   No way to slow down   No way to slow down.And if you want some fun...take Ob-la-di-bla-da (Thank you).power surge!.Ole!.oh, and his hips   All aboard for Fun Time   (Fun!).At the beginning we all had   One mother and one father   That's where we're descending from (attention)   I don't, I don't understand why so much hate (attention)      Between races, and religions   It's mad, insane   I don't understand (amazing)   Why it has to be like that?.Come on come on,   I'm right, I'm wrong and when I'm wrong I say..Dancing like the nights are down in nashville   But I seem to know the ghosts who like to run   I got a call to go to a late night picture show   So I traded in the darkness and I'm already there   I'm already there      [Chorus]   And I'm tryin' to make some friends   So if you see that movie star and me   If you see my picture in a magazine      Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV      Well honey I'm just tryin' to make some sense   Outta' me      I left a lot of ghosts in San Francisco   And now you wanna say you see through me   But what you wanna see ain't your memories of me   So why you turn around tonight   But I'm already there   I'm already there      [Chorus]      Or if you fall asleep while you're watching TV      Well honey I'm just trying to make some sense   Los Angeles   Boston gets cold this time of year   Seems like each day just leaves me numb   I gotta get out of here   Go walking in the sun      Well if you see that movie star and me   Or if you should see my picture in a magazine   Or if you fall asleep by the bedroom TV      But honey I'm just trying to make some sense   Honey I'm just trying to make some friends   Well baby I'm not trying to make amends   For coming to Los Angeles   Oh Los Angeles      No more Boston, no more Nashville, no more Oakland   Oh baby come on out to the sea   Come on take a walk down Sunset with me      Oh we gonna get drunk, find up some skinny girls, and go street walking   In Los Angeles!.Why should I care though she gave me the air,   Why should I cry,   Heave a sigh,   And wonder why,   And wonder why?.Gone and got the blues in Paris,   Paris blues called Azure-Te,   How can I be blue in Paris?.the technicolor li-I-ight!.With the rain   Pounding on his   Back he recalls   The moment that   He cracked long   Ago in the museum   With his friends..(they love ya boy)   'cause everycity that I go I be thuggin boy   [Yukmouth]   Yeah, Yuk a international star, what I pass fo'   Just like Atlanta, bitch, get ya anything ya ask fo'   Jags off the flo'   Navigation in the dash bo'   Spreewheels keep spinnin' like a cassette when it fast fo'   Nigga back and forth like Aaliyah   Call me the overseer   One night in Australia, 2 pounds of reefer   I tote around the heata, the fo' feva   Shows in Costa Rica, I blow speakas   Stuntastic ?.Oh no it's quite appalling   Your conversation is boring as hell, oh well!.Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare..He's on top...

"Dear Newspaper, Advances in technology, while amazing, don't always have a positive effect on society. That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In @DATE1's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology is advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the @LOCATION1. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in @DATE1's world..Stay young and invincible !.Yes I've brought the apples..Never let 'em see see, that you sweat, gotta go hard..Beyond the sunset, a hand will guide me   To God the Father whom I adore   His glorious presence, His words of welcome   Will be my portion on that fair shore..[Chorus]      I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,   Gonna miss the air you breathe..You do what hasn't been done before   No one loves you more   Than me   Can't you see I want you to be mine?.Do   It if you can can can, Harmonica Man..Let the world stop turning..It's the american tradition   Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen   Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?.Lighter on the other side...

"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers. I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's to @PERSON2 who is our presiden now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing. They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it. Thank you..Just a boy and a little girl   Trying to change the whole wide world,   Isolation..My house was clean..Usher!.Angel,   I never met a girl that looks like you..She use to be my rosa amarilla   My little Mexicali tomatilla   But then one night I drank too much sangria   Woke up and found a note that said I'll see ya      (Chorus)   Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more   My baby no esta aqui no more   She left me here with nada   Broke my heart like a pinata   My baby no esta aqui no more      Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her   Please, please tell her that I need her      I used to be her number one vaquero   Her numero uno caballero   But I've had to hock my spurs and my sombrero   'Cause when she left she took all my dinero      (Repeat Chorus)      Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her   Please, please tell her that I need her      Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more   My baby no esta aqui no more   she left me here with nada   Broke my heart like a pinata   My baby no esta aqui   My baby no esta aqui   My baby no esta aqui no more.Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend      That's Right (Kanye)      [Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend   Look for me   [B.K.].Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin,   Seasons of wither holdin' me in..Just to sleep, just to sleep   Put them lighters up, up   Put them lighters up, up      My body is cold, I need your help   I'm coming down from a perfect spell   Can I take a hint of your love's device   Inhale the rum, you're just in time   Your fingertips leave me hypnotized   And when it hits my lips I am paralysed!.Senorita donkey sita, not so fleet as a mosquito,   But so sweet like my Chiquita,   You're the one for me..But I love you and I always will,   So I wonder if you want me still..Ba-dah bap, ba-dah bap,   Ba-dah bap, ba-dah ba,   Ba-dah bop, ba-dah bop..I believe in you   You know the door to my very soul   You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour   You're my saviour everytime I fall      And you may not think that I care for you   When you know down inside that I really do      And it's me you need to show   How deep is your love   I really mean to learn   'Cause we're living in a world of fools   Breaking us down, when they all should let us be   We belong to you and me.....I don't want to live without your love,   I don't want to face the night alone..Oh please, oh please forgive me, yes, I know I was wrong..Every night why do I   Shake with fright?.She is an angel in a polyester uniform..Headin' for the islands   We're ready man and packed to go   When we hit those islands   There's gonna be a big hello   Diggin' all the sunshine   It's easy not to say goodbye   Bye Bye Bye      Headin' for the islands   Heyeah, We're really flyin' high   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home      Walkin' down the beaches   Tomorrow mornin' we'll be there   Golden sandy beaches   Say, I can smell the breezy air   One more celebration   And then we're ready for goodbye   Bye, Bye,Bye      Walkin' down the beaches   Heyeah, We're really flyin' high   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home      Going back home   Going back home   Going back home   Going back home      Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home, home, home   Gotta go home.Quickly lost all feelings..I!.I hope I don't sound   As immature as I feel   But when I get wise, I'll give you a call, my friend      First chance - I blew it, I better start it all again   Second chance - Ooh, I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said   Third chance - I'm cut up, life's like a razor's edge   Fourth chance - I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge      Now I'm goin' down (I'm goin' down)   Goin' down (I'm goin' down)   Goin' down (I'm goin' down)   Ooh, down (down)      Love is coming down on me, ooh yeah   Love is burning, teaching, turning out in me   Love is coming down, down   Down, down   Down, down      I'm not a loser   But did I really win?.That's all right, Mama was."
"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!.Politicians argue sharpening their knives..Sweetheart..It happened before I knew what was going on..Melinda, she's a solid sender   That girl, she'd better surrender   Oh, Miss..Close your eyes, make a wish   This could last forever   If only you could stay with me now   So tell me what it is, that keeps us from each other now   Yeah, it's coming to get me   You're under my skin      [Chorus]   No I can't let you go   You're a part of me now   Caught by the taste of your kiss   And I don't want to know the reason why I can't stay forever like this   Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you      Take my hand, take my life   Just don't take forever   And let me feel your pain kept inside (ohh yeah)   There's gotta be a way, you and I together now   Yeah it's comin' to get me   You're under my skin      [Chorus]      It's an illusion, how can I feel this way?.(Kick it up a notch, kick it up a notch) Not gonna go with the flow..Let me holla at ya, get to know ya betta   Can we get togeha and go out sometime?.Because you can't be out there doin' low   And then right gather up yo' crew and roll..Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder   Why it should be thus all the day long   While there are others living about us   Never molested, though in the wrong..[Chorus]   Hey, little girl..And all the people of the town,      They can't get through to Johnny, they will never, ever break him down..Be what you want to be..Two bottles of loneliness   Patching the holes in her dream..I've forgotten your number   I hadn't called in a while   And I'm slowly forgetting your funny little smile   I've even stopped missing   The love that we knew   But I've never stopped dreaming of you      I've lost all the memories   The feel of your touch   And it's left my mind why I loved you so much   I've even forgotten who walked out on who   But I've never stopped dreaming of you      [Chorus]   I've never stopped seeing your face every night   I see it each time that I close my eyes   And time's heal the memories   Of the pain I went through   But I've never stopped dreaming of you      I've misplaced all the trinkets   That you told me to keep   And it's been such a long time   Since I've lost any sleep   Now I'm doing just fine   With somebody new   But I've never stopped dreaming of you      [Chorus]      No I've never stopped dreaming of you.Been a long time, had a bad sign..Let's start with something simple, like one and one ain't three   Any two plus two will never get you five..That's it man, Wo ho, That's it, you got it!.When I'm in need of a little bit of consultation, used to call on my Uncle John..I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   I don't think we could ever   I don't think we could ever be friends   Ah, ha.no it can't be happen to me..Fantine   It's all I have      Old Woman   That's not my fault      Fantine   Please make it ten      Old Woman   No more than five   My dear, we all must stay alive!"
"To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 concern, today people of all ages are useing computers. Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you @MONTH1 have needed to know. Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper. Teacher have troble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful. The near by libarry will always have extra computers students can use to write a papper. If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you @MONTH1 find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives. Some of these relatives @MONTH1 live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that home work. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information. Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there. By going on one of the search engines they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo. In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 & how it is in a @CAPS9. Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope you will look into what I said..I think it's too late..You put the keys in the car and drive..Oh, oh, oh   I'm losing you!.I have a love and it's all that I have   Right or wrong, what else can I do ?.My how lovely you are, my dear,   The ball game has gone much too far my dear,   Sing to me, do your thing to me,   I'll meet you some mornin', meet you some mornin',   In the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by..If you live with me, I'll die for you   And this compromise      I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth   And nothing but the truth is what I'll ever hear from you   ""Trust"" is a dirty word that comes only from such a liar   But ""respect"" is something I will earn....He isn't you...he isn't you...

"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?.Went out drinking late last night   I had a blast   But now the morning light has come   And kicked my ass      I've got the worst hangover ever   I'm crawling to the bathroom again   It hurts so bad that I'm never gonna drink again      And by my seventh shot   I was invincible   I would have never thought   I'd be this miserable      I've got the worst hangover ever   I'm rolling back and forth on the bed   I'm worked so bad that I'm never gonna drink again      Won't someone just kill me   And put me out of my misery   I'm making deals with God, I'll do anything   Make it stop please!.Judge not this race by empty remains   Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead?.I can see it in your eyes.... .. ..Why won't you believe in what I'm missing?.Help me find the hand,   That knows where I've been..You will always be   Home, sweet, home to me   Blue Mesa.She's got an eye on you   There's nowhere to hide   She keeps her motives still   Deep down inside      She shows no mercy, no   She plays it rough   She don't want no money   She just wants to love      Love stealer, raw dealer   Heart breaker, love taker   Yeah yeah...   She walks in the shadows      As she waits for the night   She gets what she's looking for   She knows how to fight   If you see her coming      Then you'd better know   If your love's for the taking   She'll steal the show   She just can't go round there first      Facing the joint   Then she'll move in   And get right to the point   So keep your love locked away      Don't let it show   Or the love stealer will rock you   For more than you'll know.-   Hey now, reach the sky,   there's a certain kind of look in your smile..Pay no attention to the writing on the wall   The words seem Empty cause there's nothing there at all   We let the wise men beat the Drums too soon   We were just children of the moon      No one to turn to   Nowhere to Run to even if we could   Too late to save us but try to understand   The seas were empty there was hunger in the land      We let the blind man lead the Way too long   Easy to see where we went wrong   Nothing to live for   Nothing to die for   We're Lost in the middle of a hopeless world   Lost in the Middle of a hopeless world      Children children of the moon watch the world go by   Children children of the moon are hiding from the sun and the sky   Children Children of the moon watch it all go by   Children children of the moon are Blinded by the light in their eyes      No one to turn to   Nowhere to run to even if we could   Follow the pilgrim to the Temple of the dawn   The altar's empty and the sacrifice is gone   We let the Madmen write the golden rules   We were no more than mortal fools      Nothing to live for   Nothing to die for   We're lost in the middle of a hopeless world   Lost in the Middle of a hopeless world   Children children of the moon watch the world go by   Children children of the Moon hiding from the sky.Oh, we didn't think much about it, we just lived   Taking our time, beautiful leisure   When did we start, trying to measure up   And all this time, love has been trying to tell us      Don't try so hard   God gives you grace and you can't earn it   Don't think that you're not worth it   Because you are   He gave you His love and He's not leaving   Gave you His Son so you'd believe it   You're lovely even with your scars   Don't try so hard      Don't try so hard      Don't try so hard   God gives you grace   You can't earn it   Stop thinking you're not worth it   Because you are   He gave you His love and He's not leaving   Gave you His Son so you'd believe it   You're lovely even with your scars   Lovely the way you are   So open up your lovely heart   Don't try so hard.I had to call and tell you just how I felt   You should know by now that   When you're near my heart melts   I belong to a girl you hang around with   But I must admit I've got eyes for

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your motabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone. Even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights. Many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a survey an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and about an hour with family. The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind, ask your self how useful the computer really is. Sure it's good at researching things quickly but its also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glassses and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all..You gave a new meaning to the Leaning Tower of Piza   Where is the life that late I led?.[Verse 1]   When I was young   I played for fun

the evening   When I was a boy   I would gaze at the wide open skies   And I'd dream of a someday   When I'd be a man   And live with a lady with lights in her eyes   Well, I searched for that dream   Till my heart nearly broke   Till my hopes turned to hopeless and died   Until just this morning when I suddenly woke   Looked at you sleeping there and cried      This is what I dreamed   This is what I wished for   Now all at once I see   Everything I've ever wanted   Is here with me      Yes, this is what I dreamed   Like a miracle unfolding   Holding you near me   Just like this      Every moment, every kiss   Is exactly how I pictured it would be   I swear I must be dreamin'   For this is what I dreamed, ooh      And it's everywhere around us   Every cloud in the sky   Every breeze that blows by   Can't believe I've been so blind   To this sweet bliss      Yes this is what I dreamed   And I just can't help but wonder   If under those same magic skies   You were closing your eyes   And dreaming of this moment with me   My life is wide awake now   For this is what I dreamed ooh      This is what I dreamed   This is what I dreamed.Young hunks   Cyberpunks   And sweet things   Trying hard to change your luck   Baby thugs   Bad spuds   And mean things   Living for today or maybe even yesterday   Look around   Shaky ground   Do the right thing   In this world you're just a

afraid to go to sleep   Cause tomorrow is today      People tell me life is sweeter   But I don't hear what they say   Nothing comes to change my life   So tomorrow is today      I don't care to know the hour   Cause it's passing anyway   I don't have to see tomorrow   Cause I saw it yesterday      So I listen for an answer   But the feeling seems to stay   And what's the use of always dreaming   If tomorrow is today      Still I'm waiting for the morning   But it feels so far away   And you don't need the love I'm giving   So tomorrow is today      Oh, my..love comes   Right around the corner      It may not last   But here am I   Once a caterpillar   Now a butterfly   It can seem strange   But when you reminisce   It's all about change   It's a metamorphosis      [Chorus]      You grow up

He'll never love again      And keeping to himself he plays the game   Without her love it always ends the same   While life goes on around him everywhere   He's playing solitaire      Another day, a lonely day   So much to say that goes unspoken   And through the night, his sleepless nights   His eyes are closed, his heart is broken      And solitaire's the only game in town   And every road that takes him, takes him down   And by himself it's easy to pretend   She's coming back again      And keeping to himself he plays the game   Without her love it always ends the same   While life goes on around him everywhere   He's playing solitaire      A little hope, goes up in smoke   Just how it goes, goes without saying   Solitaire   And by himself it's easy to pretend   He'll never love again   Ohhh      And keeping to himself he plays the game   Without her love it always ends the same   While life goes on around him everywhere   He's playing solitaire   Solitaire, solitaire.The child in me

"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more..Should have been a father""   But he never even made it to his twenties   What a waste   Army dreamers   Ooh, what a waste of   Army dreamers   Ooh, what a waste of all that   Army dreamers   Army dreamers   Army dreamers, oh      ""B.F.P.O."".""Bblblblblblblbl!"".We drown our doubts   In

some go down   Some go thirsty, some just drown   ""That's the law 'round here,""      Said the king of sunset town   A ragged man came shuffling through   The corridors of this white place   And as he lay his body down      I saw the scars that lined his face   And injured souls came to his bed   To hear the stories he would tell   Of butterflies and summertimes      And everyone assembled here   Remembers how it used to be   Before the twenty-seventh came   This place will never be the same      He said, ""I'm the king of sunset town."".She's got the devil in her heart   But her eyes they

all my weeds but kept the flowers   But I know it's never really over      I don't know   I could crash and burn but maybe   At the end of this road I might catch a glimpse of me   So I won't worry about my timing I wanna get it right   No comparing   Second guessing   No, not this time      Three months and I'm still breathing   Been a long road since those hands I left my tears in but I know   It's never really over, no      Wake up      Three months and I'm still standing here   Three months and I'm getting better yeah   Three months and I still am      Three months and it's still harder

to keep you pleased      [Chorus:]   But I don't care no more   About nothing you do   Now I'm goin' shoppin'   Finger, fingerpoppin' on you      I got bags under my eyes   From losin' sleep   You

world, and the wants of a woman   If I figured them all out 'twould take many years      I once had a sweetheart, the fairest of maidens   She out shined all others that I'd known by far   I had a friend, a big fella, named big Harlan Taylor   Harlan had a rubber-tired, new shiny car      [Chorus]      By the wants of a woman she fell for big Harlan   I tried, but in vain, for to take my own life   Suddenly I had lost all my will to keep livin'   She lost her desire to become my young wife      [Chorus]      I wanted revenge and waylaid for big Harlan   Then I started wonderin' what good would it do   If a rubber-tired, new shiny car's her ambition   Then she can just have it and big Harlan, too      [Chorus]      If I figured them all out.I'm working hard tryin' to pull it together..You know I need someone, help..I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms   And raced through the burning building out to the pavement."
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1! Get off that computer it is @TIME1. But mom I don’t want to im in the middle of a game. Does that conbersation sound familiar? Of course it does. Every kid likes to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer @NUM1 is not a good thing. In this matter experts are definatley @PERCENT1 right because kids and adults are spending too much time on the computer. These people can do other things like excersising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up. Every years my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dash, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to @DATE2 then my dad does another assment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excersises are bench pressing, squating, and dumbell curles. There are more challenging excersise but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that trainign and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrls to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excersise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their families insted of being on the computer @NUM1..when no one is around   Do you think how dare they will love you..Funny how people so close   Know the things to   say that can hurt the most..Honey, I want, I want my whole life   To be lived with you, babe,   That's what I want oh, was to be

bug   I guess it's hard to see a monster above you   She said she'd save her heart for me   But now it's there for all to see   And her last words to me were, ""I AAAAAGGHH!"".You know what's coming

need      He's never early never late   It takes courage and it takes faith   Trust Him you'll see he's got   All the power you need      He saves forgives and heals   He takes back what the devil steals   My debt's paid in full   And every day He does miracles      God dreams turn them into plans   Too big for human hands   Trust Him you'll see   He's got all the power you need      He's real He's real   Faith's a lot stronger than what you feel   He's real He's real   I'm believing for miracles      Trust Him you'll see   He's got all the power you need.People pushing, hustling, rushing on into the future   Windows open, closing, in a way that they just never used to   Oh there's violence lurking in the alleys   Where no one should dare go   So keep walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere      I gotta get out, somebody...that guy came at me with a gun   The city closing in      Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere   We're gonna take a little   Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere   We're gonna take a little   Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere   We're gonna take a little   Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere   We're gonna take a little      Children crying, screaming, but no one lets on that they hear them   It's getting louder, louder, surely that someone must hear them   'cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me   It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare   No matter which way-mare      Help me, i want to get out..It was so right   It was so wrong   Almost at the same time   The pain and ache   A heart can take   No one really knows   But when the memories cling and take you there   Till you no longer care   You can let go now   It's not right for me   To cling to you   Somehow I just needed time   From what was to be   It's not like me   To hold somebody down   But I was tossed high by love   Almost never came down   Only to land   Where no love is found   And I'm no longer bound   I can let go now.Still be there after you're gone."
"These have been many advancements on computer technology and there are people who are for it and there are people who are against it. In against it and ill you why. You spend less time exercising which you'll gain weight. Spend less time enjoying nature which means youre lost with anything natural, an spend less time with friends and family which probbaly prove you, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 not saying the computer is a bad thing but to much of it certaintly is. First, you spend less time exercising. you don't exrcise you gain weight, you could do most of the stuff you could of , and you risk health. This is a bad thing because your not yourself anymore and if it goes to far you can't even a move. So if this sounds scary plan your time on the computer, so it doesn't happen to you, time is so limited that we waste it on stuff in computers so think before you go on the computer maybe you can go for a jog outside. Next, you spend less time playing nature. Nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing. There are only a few hundred maybe they said of us these truly help the environment, and if you think then few hundred of thousand people is alot . @NUM1.billion people of earth. Its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die, while most of us do nothing to help. Finaly, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most important reason of all. The main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world. Your friends important them. Your family might leave you if you your life to the computer if you they you so be carfully. Your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh. have good times and cheer you up when you upset. Just don't forget that as be gone. Well, there you have it my three reasons for being against work on the computer and they all sound like a good reasons so lets recap it all shall we. First, spend less time exersing, very important. Next spend less time enjoying nature, very important. Finaly less time with friends or family the most important of all. So hoped you enjoyed my essay and you've learned something . So remember to much of good thing is bad and I'll just leave you with . .The ride's over, fair thee well   Not on my time      It isn't fair to mention, but it awes the crowd   Your fictional, plastic

with you      And it's hard for me to stay away   When my emotions so alive   So I try to live just day to day   Never knowing where love's leading us to   Is there no end, is there no end   For will our hearts join over and over again, again      Sometimes I cannot understand what is going on inside   Why you're always, always on my mind   'cause forever is such a long, long time   To awake, so may I make it clear   Love is never win or lose   It isn't something we can even choose   When true passion has slowly lit the fuse      And it's hard for me to stay away   When my emotions's so alive   So I try to live just day to day   Never knowing where love's   Leading us to   Is there no end, is there no end   For will our hearts join over and over again, again      Ok, well, what's it all about   It's allright to change your mind   But whenever you found what you must find   Just remember, I'm holding on the line   So take advice from an old friend   To the heart you must be true   While you're doing all the things you do   Know that always, I'm in love with you.Living in a fields a blessing,   With no gun, can't be done..Remember when I saw you for the first time   I never thought you'd be mine   Then we went ahead and fell in love   Heaven was a common ground   We were never coming down   The two of us we had more than enough   You and I are not the same   To you love is just a game   Things will never be the same again      So now goodbye   This time I will be gone goodbye   Stayed for way too long   Started out with trust   But it isn't just about the good times

a table out of clay   I placed my hands upon the plans   I waited for a proud display   I played around   I heard the sound of certain trouble on the way      I got bulldog skin      I took a car   I drove it far   I dug the quality of steel   I crashed my nerve   I made it swerve   I made it back - was no big deal   I tasted blood   A date with scud   And now I don't know how to feel      I got bulldog skin   (Spark from the master).You live with apes man, it's hard to be clean.You'd like to think you're groovy, it's your movie, you see through me, but it's true,   And in the end you'll

you like I do   I don't know why I just do   I don't know why I love ya like I do   I don't know why I just do   I don't know why you thrill me like you do   I don't know why but you do   You never seem to want my romancing   Ah, the only time you hold me is when we're dancing      I don't know why I love ya like I do   I don't know why I just do.Oh like a bird on the wire,   Like a drunk in a midnight choir have tried in my way to be free..Silence falls on no-mans land   To echo on uncertain footsteps   Sharp of iron quick of hand   Advancing forward to regrets   Under foot the and mortars   Slip away the codes of warnings   From the top the barking orders   Light the sky and leave that morning      CHORUS   Seek asylum from the terror   Reaching out for what its worth   Shelter from the raging anger   Raining down on bitter worlds      Those the people all whose hurting   Getting lost between the lines   Its the stuff that keeps returning   Laughing lound in victors lies   Up above on winds declaring   Soon the cold will whistle through   Push aside the warm sea air   That fills the sails that carry you      CHORUS X3   Many miles are put between oh   What once was and what will be   Sleep all night and dream sweet dreams   Step inside to history   Every whisper sings resistance   All emotions hide inside   Refugee looks to the distance   Out there somewhere lies his pride      CHORUS"

Also what if the movie sells out or is canceld, don't worry with the internet you can reschedele and buy tickets online. So that doesn't happen again. Suddenly your phone rings, its d call from your best friend saying to turn on the news, but you have to leave to pick up your kids in three minutes. Instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and , you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early.

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think that computers have a positive or negative affect on people's lives? Well if you think it is negative I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand-eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. First, computers teach good hand-eye coordination. While you use computers you are improving your hand-eye coordination. One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger, you move the mouse and click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand-eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all.

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one? Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing..It looks like the Predator   it's gettin' dissed by the editor   Looked up and hell of white for caper   It's to lynch a nigga on paper   But I'm much too black for the god damn cracker   Huh!.'Wow!.[Verse] Bless The Lord, O my soul   O my soul   Worship his holy name   Sing like never before   O my soul   I'll worship your holy name      The sun comes up   It's a new day dawning   It's time to sing your song again      Whatever may pass   And whatever lies before me   Let me by singing   When the evening comes      Bless The Lord, O my soul   O my soul   Worship his holy name   Sing like never before   O my soul   I'll worship your holy name      Your rich in love   And your slow to anger   Your name is great   And your heart is kind      For all your goodness   I will keep on singing   Ten thousand reasons   For my heart to find      Bless The Lord, O my soul   O my soul   Worship his holy name   Sing like never before   O my soul   I'll worship your holy name.You're the only one I'll ever love, uh huh   Dream lover of my dreams   I only see you when I dream my dream   I love you endlessly   I wake up nervous in a sweat   Don't ever wake me up   Don't wake me up   Dream lover you're the only one I love      It's only you who satisfies me   You mesmerize and mystify me   I'll never get this feeling from any other   And I really miss you in the morning      Dream lover you and I   Are two lovers of the night   Dream lover hope you see   You're the only one I'll ever love, uh huh   Dream lover of my dreams   I only see you when I dream my dream   I love you endlessly   I wake up nervous in a sweat   Don't ever wake me up   Don't wake me up   Dream lover you're the only one I love      How I wish that I could keep you   But I'll just see you when I see you   I wish the night would last just a little longer   ?Cause I really miss you when it's morning      After each night, the day seems long   For dream lovers who wait to rush into each other's arms   It's you that keeps me dreaming      Dream lover please be mine   I love you every night   Dream lover where are you?.Suckers are trying to step off on my tip   We got our own ideas!.Hoshekh matay yayir hayom?.Where will it end?.Yeah, sing the song, Bro'      If the sun refuse to shine,   I don't mind, I don't mind,   If the mountains fell in the sea,   Let it be, it ain't me..Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears   He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would 'pear   Junior sighed, as his hands reached out to the sky   Junior cried, the day that his best friend died   Yeah!.No I cannot believe it's you, really you      Over and over I keep on telling myself   Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up   Over and over I know it's really happening   And there's nothing that I can say   Cause nothing can change all the things that you've done to me   Nothing can make me stay      Oh, 'cause you know I cannot believe it's true   Are you really doing the things you do   No I cannot believe it's you, really you      I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you   It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through Never meant it to show   It started happening, that's all you know..I wish I knew when it melts, (I wish I knew)   I wish I knew when it happens, (I wish I knew)   I wish I knew if it happens at all, (I wish I knew)   I wish I knew what it means to me..black (?).Was it my imagination, or did I hear you say,   ""We don't have a prayer between us."".Where do we go now?.,   when the Spirit's torn from your Flesh ..Rudolph valentino, looks very much alive,   And he looks up ladies' dresses as they sadly pass him by..O' Glendora...O' Glendora...

"In my own opinion, computers are great addition to our world. Computers can help people with schoolwork, communication and entertain you in a safe way. Those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world. First of all, computers help with a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world-wide-web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can't find in books. In addition if a student forgets, losses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be @CAPS1 neat @CAPS1 possible. That is hard for some students,  typing it is neat, and everyone can do it. @CAPS1 you can see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are a great way to communicate and keep-in-touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send some thing to him, he could easily e-mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, the could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up an conference, the teacher could e-mail the parent a time and date. That is why computers are great can easy communication. Lastley, computers provide a safe, fun way or entertainment. Many companies make kid-friendly websites that  go on. For instance, my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kindergardeners who go on these websites, do better in first grade compared to those who don't computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide east communication, and provide safe educational activities, @CAPS1 you can see, computers are a great addition to our world..Well its been building up inside of me   For oh I don't know how long   I don't know why   But I keep thinking   Something's bound to go wrong      But she looks in my eyes   And makes me realize   And she says ""Don't worry baby""   Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby   Everything will turn out alright      Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby      I guess I should've kept my mouth shut   When I started to brag about my car   But I can't back down now because   I pushed the other guys too far      She makes me come alive   And makes me want to drive   When she says ""Don't worry baby""   Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby   Everything will turn out alright      Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby      She told me ""Baby, when you race today   Just take along my love with you   And if you knew how much I loved you   Baby nothing could go wrong with you""      Oh what she does to me   When she makes love to me   And she says ""Don't worry baby""   Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby   Everything will turn out alright      Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby   Don't worry baby.In a place you've forgotten   A place I've forgotten      So where is my boy?.I....

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, ect. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloose you to draw or biuld. I bet the even help young children became smarter by biulding things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad econimy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and bretheing you can find broken bones or tomors, you can biuld briges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most importen and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camra for or save a life by fing were they crased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter..(with Carole Bayer Sager)      You and me   We've traded hearts   I guess that's how   It always starts out   And then I guess it always ends      Look at us   (Now)   Sayin'   I don't think that you and me   Can just be friends   Maybe this is how the whole thing   Has to just end      And if we could   Have loved enough   (La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah, la...)   We would have handled   When it got rough   But one of us let go too soon      So here we are   (Here we are)   Now sayin'   I don't think that you and me   Can just be friends   Maybe this is how the

"I do not agree that computers benefits society. There are threes big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and arent spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people arent getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day. People would gain weight might ever get dabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten tov used to all the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk, with friends. People should al least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. So this is why I think this is bad for the societys benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart. Thank you!.Isn't it madness   He won't be mine?.I knew that I had drunk too much   I had passed my drink degree   I climbed into my rented car   I was happy as could be      Then I pulled out of the

"Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. My neibor, who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. So I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad.That is why computers have a negative effect on our society..I didn't want to see you   Not when you're at your best   And talk about the weather   I couldn't pass the test      So many things I do   So many things I say   Give you the wrong idea   So many things I do   So many things I say   Just make a fool of me      Then you turn away   Then you turn away      I couldn't help but call you   I waited almost all the week   I didn't want to hear you   Laughing aloud at me      So many things I do   So many things I say   Give you the wrong idea   So many things I do   So many things I say   Just make a fool of me      Then you turn away   Then you turn away      There's people saying that it's obvious   That I'm wasting my time on you   And people saying that it's obvious   That I've fallen in love, it's not true      So many things I do   So many things I say   Give you the wrong idea   So many things I do   So many things I say   Just make a fool of me      Then you turn away   Then you turn away.Intro:   Once upon a time in our life   We held the key to every door   And I that I desired   Was you forever more   I found love in a heart   Once broken far beyond repair   And you restored a sole   That had forgotten how to care   Everything we needed   Was at our beckon call   With you and I together   We could conquer all   When I needed badly   To be cheered up for a while   You were there   And all you had to do was simply smile   And holding things together   Was so easy for us to do   For you could turn to me for help   And I could turn to you   And jealousy was something   That never entered our hearts   For we were made for one another   No matter where we are   When things were at there darkest   I could hold you next to me   And I knew all would be okay   For you were strong and I was weak   So given every chance for me   To start my life anew   There'd be no question   I'd do it all again with you.He'll say he just wants to be friends..A cowboy with his sweetheart stood beneath a starlit sky   Tomorrow he was leaving for the lonesome prairie wide   She said ""I'll be your lovingbride when you return someday""   He handed her a broken ring and to her he did say      ""You'll find upon that ring sweetheart my name engraved in gold   And I shall keep the other half which bears your name you know."".Are you ready, Jonathan?.We've been, for years, In Variety,   But, Cholly Knickerbocker, now we're going to be      In High,

time that you need   All of the things that you've done   I'm certain that you had your fun      Go out and make it better   You can make it if you try   Try to make it better      Somebody calls in the night   Says he can make things go right   I know there'll soon come a day   Things will start falling your way      I'll try to help if I can   So don't hide your head in the sand, oh no   Why are you feeling so low   You're wondering where will you go.It's like whatever I do   Oh   Just can't get through to you   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh   I'm never gonna tell you nothin' more   Listen      Now, now she loved me, shawty I loved her   Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out   Used to care, she used to share   The love that she used to give me can't be found   I lost my way, she said she'd stay   And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost   My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold   That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us   And that was before the hurricane came, came in and stopped us   I told you to leave, but you lied to me   When you said that, ""baby no worries I promise to get us back""..For now anyway.With the eyes of a child   You must come out and see   That your world's spinning 'round   And through life you will be   A small part of a hope   Of a love that exists   In the eyes of a child you will see.I thought I had a trick or two   Up my imaginary sleeve..No, I, I know it's hard to remember   The people we used to be   It's even harder to picture   That you're not here next to me   You say it's too late to make it   But is it too late to try?.There's a golden coin,   That reflects the sun....Antwan the Swan, from the pretty fish pond   Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong   He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat   And between his legs was a sweat young lass   He threw a hundred women up against the wall   And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all   By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop   Because that's when he thought that he heard a Fop   Last night and the night before, I heard a   Fop outside, then I came in doors   Rock out!.I'm heading for the door   I can't stand this emotional violence   Leave in silence   We've been running around in circles all year   Doing this and that and getting nowhere   This'll be the last time   (I think I said that last time)   If I only had a potion,   Some magical lotion   That could stop this, I would stop this   I would set the wheels in motion   What can I say?.Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,   It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!.We've all been so proud of our blindness   No kindness to share      [Chorus]   I used to cry for the lost   Until I had to turn away..When you open it to speak,   Are you smart?...And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn,   And in a manger cold 'n' dark, Mary's little boy was born."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you dont even need a keyboard. Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. We'll computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the vireses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parcore. Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They to, might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a buisness that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more.If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us suesede is great..Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger,   Some face you'll never see no more..""A busy life keeps a body busy   If you never take the time of day   To ask yourself ""Is there something else?"".Is like I'm in love with a stranger   It's nothing familiar about your touch   And I need a way to make sense of this person I met   As a flame that burns through my heart..I once heard Captain Dan tell me a story   About this lovely girl who's name was Jane   She was vast and deep and filled with glory   Aaaahhhh   Bottom served as home for hull and anchor   She's always fit to quarrel with the wind   The great Titanic yes it's she that sank her   Aaaahhhh   Then she heard me   Say that oath that   Made everything clear   I love you   My ocean blue   I like the way your sea sees me   My darling Jane   She speaks to me at times through falling rain   Now twas time to manifest her vigor   Was she fit to quarrel with the wind?.Got my risin suspicion got my eye on you..No more under the quilt   To keep you warm..By the light of the moon   When the night holds the secrets   Of the sleepy lagoon   I'm contemplating moonlight   On the water   When I'm walking with you   On an evening in June      On an evening in June   It can get so sentimental   When I'm thinking of you   And I can't think of anything   Except being with you   When the summer is through   On an evening in June      On an evening in June   Well it lifts me up   When I'm talking to you   On an evening in June   When the flowers are in bloom   And the sky is so blue      Well there's so many things   Taking place   That it's hard to keep up with it all   Keep your eye on the ball   And to make the right call   When we're longing for fall   On this evening in June      On an evening in June   Well it lifts me up   When I'm talking to you   On an evening in June   When the flowers are in bloom   And the sky is so blue      Well there's so many things taking place   That it's hard to keep up with it all   Keep your eye on the ball   And to make the right call   When we're longing for fall   On this evening in June   By the sleepy lagoon   On an evening in June   By the light of the moon   By the sleepy lagoon   On an evening in June   On an evening in June   By the sleepy lagoon   By the light of the moon   By the sleepy lagoon   On an evening in June.If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea,   I'll sail the world to find you   If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see,   I'll be the light to guide you      Find out what we're made of   When we are called to help our friends in need      You can count on me like one two three   I'll be there   And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two   You'll be there   'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah      Whoa, whoa   Oh, oh   Yeah, yeah      If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep   I'll sing a song   Beside you   And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me   Everyday I will   Remind you      Ooh   Find out what we're made of   When we are called to help our friends in need      You can count on me like one two three   I'll be there   And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two   You'll be there   'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah      Oh, oh   Yeah, yeah      You'll always have my shoulder when you cry   I'll never let go   Never say goodbye   You know you can      You can count on me like one two three   I'll be there   And I know when I need it I can count on you like four three two   And you'll be there   'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah      Oh, oh   You can count on me 'cause I can count on you.decite, injustice!.Soon we'll reach that silver river   Soon our pilgrimage will cease   Soon our happy hearts will quiver   With the melody of peace..Severin' legs, arms, damn there goes another limb..You wanna get a hotel room with me?.Well how's your new love, how's your new love..She wanna pearl necklace..Cut the head off   Grows back hard   I am the hydra   Now you'll see your star   The time has come it is quite clear   Our antichrist   Is almost here   Cut the head off   Grows back hard   I am the hydra   Now you'll see your star   (When you are suffering, know that I've betrayed you).Did you ever call my name by mistake?.I'm sayin', it's nice to be back home   Among my friends..But you're running away with my heart, my heart..He was a stranger in london at night   And he felt alone so he followed a light   Into a bar where the music was loud   He ordered a pint and got lost in the crowd   He asked a girl if she wanted to dance   She turned up her nose and she told him ""no chance!"".Movin' light, dream machinery   Crashin' in, through my balcony -

"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise.

"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say @CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11. PC and start seeing @ORGANIZATION2 Nature! She's beautiful!.And Aubrey was her name,   And not so very ordinary girl, or name   But who's to blame   For a love that wouldn't bloom   For the hearts that never played in tune ?.You better run, homeboy,   A fact's a fact   From Nome to Rome, boy..Living my life in a slow hell   Different girl every night at the hotel   I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days   Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey   Wish I had a good girl to miss me   Oh I wonder if I'll ever change my ways      [Chorus: x 2]   I put your picture away   Sat down and cried today   I can't look at you   While I'm lying next to her   I put your picture away   Sat down and cried today   I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her      I called you last night in the hotel   Everyone knows but they won't tell   But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right   I've been waiting on you for a long time   Filling up on heartaches and cheap wine   I ain't heard from you in three damn nights      [Chorus: x 2]   I put your picture away   I wonder where you've been   I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him   I put your picture away   I wonder where you've been   I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him      I saw you yesterday with an old friend      It was the same old same how have you been      Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey      You reminded me of brighter days      I hoped you were coming home to stay   I was headed to church      I was off to drink you away      I thought about you for a long time   Can't seem to get you off my mind   I can't understand why we're living life this way      I found your picture today   I swear I'll change my ways   I just called to say I want you to come back home   I found your picture today      I swear I'll change my ways   I just called to say I want you   To come back home   I just called to say I love you   Come back home.When im..so in love with you   I could never..never ever   Love this way again say...

choose my path, hey, come on, Kath,   He's a lawyer, he ain't the one for ya   No, the moon ain't romantic, it's intimidating as hell,   And some guy's trying to sell me a watch   And so I'll meet you at the bottom of a bottle of bargain Scotch   I got me a bottle and a dream, it's so maudlin it seems,   You can name your poison, go on ahead and make some noise   I ain't sentimental, this ain't a

"The computer is a great achivement of man. It is very useful for finding information fast, and has many other capabilities. Even though computers are every useful tool in the modern world. It has negatively afect to people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Along with that they are being socialy active. The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people. It would be great if some how the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should wont to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just dont let computers control your life..I know you'll never miss it..Gazing through the window at the world outside..The air is warm   I hear the wind and the trees   I know I'm there, but I'll never be   The wind is soft tonight, the tide is low   And I know the way   (I never felt better now)      Sometimes life, it moves too slow   Slows to a crawl, and then the poetry is lost   And without speed, hope becomes certainty   And for once I'm certain   (I never felt better now)      A garden is it's own perfect world   Where everything has a place   Every leaf, every stone, every speck of dirt   But where's my place?.You see right through me   And I can't hide   I'm naked   Around you   And it feels so right      I'm naked   Oh oh yeah   Does it show?.And then the bullhorn cackles and the captain tackles,   With the problems and the ""how's"" and ""why's."".Oh!.It's a simple enough task boys   To find a living miracle   But the living ain't easy   I need a shot of medecine      Start the day, the day   My head denies I'm breathing   It likes to say   Am I here or leaving me?.I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you) I love you now..Please read my letter closely,   It's beneficial to you,   Must read in between the lines,   A message you will see..Golden rose, the color of the dream I had   Misty blue and lilac too   Golden rose, the color of the dream I had   Misty blue and lilac too   Gold and rose, gold are rose, gold and rose..The end is finally here   God have mercy!.Well, love's gotta be warm   And love's gotta be right   And this ain't no ice cube that you're with tonight   So don't you dish me out the cool love   (Give me that cool love)   It don't move me at all   (Move me at all)   And if you'd live it up, baby   Man, we'd really have a ball (baby!).Ooh look at me in a Cadillac   You can play in a convertible child   I've never been driven baby you're the first   come on baby drive me wild, ooh      Ooh look at me on the telephone   whatever you want just dial   come on baby please it's so easy   do it baby drive me wild      come on baby do it drive me wild   do it baby drive me wild      Ooh look at me on the radio   call me up and make a request   If you want anything just name it   when I'm bad baby I'm the best      Ooh look at me on the big guitar   stick me up with a smile   come on baby please it's so easy   do it baby drive me wild.How can it be real?.Look at us the picture of happiness   Not so long ago, Ah, not so very long ago   The pride of all our friends   The perfect couple were we   Is this how it will end?.What am I supposed to say?.I don't need you anymore,   I don't want you, baby, hanging round my door..Sun he giving life in his light,   Part of the system,   Friend to man, friend to the trees,   No friend to the snowman..Dear god do you want to tear your knuckles down   And hold yourself   Dear god do you want to climb of that tree   Meat in the shape of a 'T'   Dear god the paper says you were the King   In the black limousine   Dear John and all the King's men   Can't put your head together again      Before the bullets   Before the flies   Before authorities take out my eyes   The only smiling are you dolls that I made   But you are plastic and so are your brains      Dear god the sky is as blue   As a gunshot wound   Dear god if you were alive   You know we'd kill you      Before the bullets   Before the flies   Before authorities take out my eyes   The only smiling are you dolls that I made   But you are plastic and so are your brains.'Cause I am sleeping on a time bomb   And I am waiting for the light to come   You and I could get away now   Do you know      [Chorus]      I get up sometimes   Like somebody else   Am I just wasting time   For somebody else      Take a listen through the window   Another lover on the radio   Ask her if she's got an answer   Do you know?.Come on now fella, pass me down the relish."
"Have you ever had a computer? I'm sure if you was around my age you know how fun it is to explore the internet. It's a brain tht gives you information about everything. But, it’s not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer. Things like exercise, socializing and homework matter. If you don't exercise you begin to gain weight, if you don't socialize you'll be an lonely person. Homework is the most important, because it'll help you really well through life. It's fine to go on the computer time to time, but not for hours. Exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports, you should jog a couple times of day. Some people make you feel bad if your bigger than they are. For example, I knew someone who was a little big for his age, but people didn't like him and they always made fun of him. I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer. Do you have ant friends? Or did all of them leave you because you wouldn't stop surfinh the web on your computer. As a teenager you should be socializing with your friend at the movies, arcaded and parties. Not in the house on the computer. Especially with your family, because you never know if they're going shopping for you ask me that's selfishness. Every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades? Education is the most important thing you need in your life. Without it you can't be or do anthing, because you wouldn't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job how can you pay for electrity bill for your computer? Education can get anywhere, if you want it. If not you can be a homeless guy in the street holding a computer that doesn't work. Do you still think this has a positive effect on people? You should talk to parents about getting their child an computer. For example, tell the parent to put a password that only she/he knows, that way he has to ask you to sign onto it everytime we needs it. Blocks off things that you think is important for your child., especially if your child is into sex. That is why I don't think it gives people the right kind effect they might need..Lead me to an open road   And put me on the freeway..And did the countenance divine   Shine forth upon our clouded hills?.Cry like a child, though these years make me older,   With children my time is so wastefully spent,   A burden to keep, though their inner communion,   Accept like a curse an unlucky deal..(United State United State United State United State of Atlanta)   Form greater holmes to inglewood from metro to clevland av from progression rd to pry st from oakland rd to E.A..Whoa but I will not be sad   after all the fun we've had..And I'm sending it back to you.In Eldorado town   There lives a great bullfighter   His eyes are screaming blue   His hair is red as blood   And when the gate goes up   The crowd gets so excited   And he comes dancin' out   Dressed in gold lame   He kills the bull and lives another day..It did some good,   Did some harm..Can't look me in the eye   A couple thousand miles away   You took me by surprise      You left a message on the telephone   From New York City, your new home   You didn't like the neighborhood   You really hated Hollywood      [Chorus]   You said   Bye bye, baby   Bye bye, girl   Bye bye, baby   You're in another world      You said my friends are boring   You said my house is small   You like it fifty stories high   You like livin' tall      You hate the L.A. freeways   You hate the L.A. smog   You hate the west coast phonies   You like the city dogs      I'm confused but I'm not mad   Said I'm the worst you've ever had   I ain't delusional or institutional   But I'm pretty sure I ain't that bad      [Chorus]      I tried to reach you on your private line   You sure ain't calling mine   Now I'm sittin' here all alone   With a broken heart in three time zones      Bye bye, baby   (Bye bye, baby)   Bye bye, girl   (Paging your phone)      Bye bye, baby   (Please check your email)   Bye bye, girl   (Why not your beeper?).And after a while, you can work on points for style..Sometime world, pass me by again,   Carry you, carry me, away..A father's love is maybe all it takes   To not repeat those sad mistakes of men   If I ever get to Saginaw again.Often I wonder why I must journey   Over a road so rugged and steep   While there are others living in comfort   While with the lost I labour and weep..Born just to cry?.So they met on Tuesday at the town hall steps   To get an eight by ten photo and a wedding date set..Would I just be an after-thought?.There's a cockroach in my coffee   There's a needle in my arm   And I feel like New York City   Get me to the farm   Get me to the farm   Get me to the farm   Get me to the farm   Somebody get me to the farm   I got terminal uniqueness   I'm an egocentric man   I get caught up in my freakness   But I ain't no Peter Pan   Get me to the farm   Get me to the farm   Get me to the farm   Get me to the farm   Get me...

"Dear editor I agree that people do spend to much time on their computers. An if you read this you would see my reasons why. One of them will be about exercising. The two others will be about your friends and family. So read my reasons and by the end I hope I made my point. All right like I said first we will talk about what the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer. Did you know that from being on the computer all the time you lose focus on exercising anymore? Of you eating an @CAPS1 not exercising, because your worried about the computer. The weight that you put on you know just doesn't burn off by themselves. So by you not burning off that fat you just keep gaining and gaining. By the time you know it you'll be over weigh and wish you didn't spend all that time on that computer. How that I'm explaining about your of exercise. Where going to talk about your you bring on the computer all you would with your family. For example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer @CAPS1 parents would @CAPS1 they would because your lack of communication with the family. I've got my two reasons across let me get my third. Of you bing on that computer you have been adicted, but you just don't lose contact with family, but also with friends. You loving that computer so much you probably quite all your like the basketball, softball, and more teams because you thought it took to much of your computer time. In the end you would lose probably alot of frienships. @CAPS1 your boyfriend or girlfriend would dump you. So now that you read this I hope I got my point out to you, about what a computer can do to you in the end..(Keep me hangin' on)      Set me free why don't cha babe   Get out my life why don't cha babe   'Cause you don't really love me   You just keep me hangin' on      Set me free why don't cha babe   Get out my life why don't cha babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)   'Cause you don't really need me   But you keep me hangin' on      Why do you keep a comin' around playing with my heart?.Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world..ha!.How do you do that shit   How do you do that shit   How do you do that shit   How do you   How do you   How do you   How do you   How do you      You let me win,   You let me ride   You let me rock   You let me slide   And when they lookin'   You let me hide..Well, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles   And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go..So you've heard I've been flyin'   And tryin' to get into   Somebody new   And I'm off on a new love   And don't hardly ever   Think about you..Listen      I kind of noticed, from one night   From the club, your front face   It's kind of weird to me   Since you're so fine   If it's up to me your face will change      If you smiling, that should set the tone   Just be limber   If you let go, the music should groove your bones   Just remember   Sing this song with me      Ain't nobody love you like I love you   You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya   Late at night, I talk to you   You will know the difference when I touch you      People are so phony   Nosy 'cause they're lonely   Aren't you sick of the same thing?.I was an unmarried girl   I'd just turned twenty-seven   When they sent me to the sisters   For the way men looked at me   Branded as a Jezebel   I knew I was not bound for Heaven   I'd be cast in shame   Into the Magdalene laundries      Most girls come here pregnant   Some by their own fathers   Bridget got that belly   By her parish priest   We're trying to get things white as snow   All of us woe-begotten-daughters   In the streaming stains   Of the Magdalene laundries      Prostitutes and destitutes   And temptresses like me   Fallen women   Sentenced into dreamless drudgery   Why do they call this heartless place   Our Lady of Charity?.You can't cross the boundary beyond   Which she stands..Everyone here needs to know their place   Let's keep this blackbird hidden in the flue      [Chorus]   Oh oh oh Jena   Oh oh oh Jena   Oh oh oh Jena   Take your nooses down      So what becomes of boys that cannot think straight   Particularly those with paper bag skin   Yes sir, no sir, we'll wipe that smile right off your face   We've got our rules here and you must fit in      [Chorus]      Some day some way sanity will prevail   But who knows when that day might come   A shot in the dark, well it just might find its way   To the hearts of those that hold the keys to kingdom come      [Chorus: x2]      Take those nooses all down.Here comes the ocean   and the waves down by the sea   Here comes the ocean   and the waves where've they been ?.you will, you see:   In midnight gazes   I've found you far from me:   If you lead me on   Please leave me down      O Flying Flying Fish   Please flutter by my door:   Yes you can drink my lies   If first you read my eyes:   Each one is titled   ""I'm drowning back to you"":   I can't swim your waters   And you can't walk my lands:   I'm sailing all my sins   And I'm climbing all my fears   And soon now I'll fly      O I never asked to be your mountain   I never asked to fly   Remember when you came to me   And told me of his lies   You didn't understand my love   You don't know why I try   And the rain was falling on that day   And that's the reason why      Sweet lover, will you come back   And love me for a while?.Better get yourself and forget about that girl   They thought I was acting crazy not to get excited too   But all the money in the world could never take the place of you      All over the city the lights were so pretty   The holiday was filled with cheer   The stars really glistened and lovers were kissin'   It was the special part of the year   So what a perfect time it was to find someone to say ""I do""   Thought that I could still be happy even though she wasn't you   We had told the world we were going to ring the wedding bell   But when I really thought about it, I was really lying to myself.But when it comes round to you and me   I'm sure it will work out alright..Better not, much too busy   You're in a hurry, my how time does fly   In the distance the ringing of laughter   And in the midst of the laughter he cries      Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue   Wrap your presents to your darling from you   Pretty pencils to write I love you   Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue.Yes, I must have more to love than what you told me..These sensations barely interest me for another day,   I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away..(together)   Together?.I said, ""Oh no, doncha follow me no more."".Long live the king!"".The love bug done bit me,   Didn't mean for him to get me,   Woo, get up in the morning   And I'm filled with desire,   No, no, I can't stop the fire,   Love is real live wire,   Oo, it's a burning sensation,   Far beyond imagination."
"Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people not great but its good for many reasons, for now I have three reason why its good, my reasons are, search new places meet new people, when people have nothing to do, and teenagers that cant be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they dont have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they dont have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also thre are many websites of movies. My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer. teenagers are teenagers they must have technology. If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop. This is my opion on the effects computers have on people..Whoa Oh   Are you listening?.No, no, no don't murder me..Little johnny hooker, he ain't a bad looker, he ain't a bad man, he ain't..I don't even know what I'm reading!.Float with the breeze and cross seas to shores   Deserts, cactus, and tumbleweed   Irish meadows and fields of green   Glide through cities of brick and stone   Broken arrows of ancient roan   Fly with me   Come on and fly with me   Come on and fly with me   Come on and fly with me   Come on and fly with me   Won't you come fly with me?.Fill the sky with love   Fill the sky with love      I wouldn't mind but she just turned up on the doorstep   Wishful and ashen, slightly bedraggled   Last time I saw her she was howling at the moon   Roaming the forest, lupine and rabid      Whoa is she wild?.What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is   What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,   Charles de Gaulle   And Robert Louis Stevenson?).Dee-goo-pee-oo-poo   Ta-dan!.Me and Mrs. Jones, we got a thing going on   We both know that it's wrong   But it's much too strong to let it go now      We meet every day at the same cafe   Six-thirty, I know she'll be there   Holding hands, making all kinds of plans   While the jukebox plays our favorite song      Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones   We got a thing going on   We both know that it's wrong   But it's much too strong to let it go now      We gotta be extra careful   That we don't build our hopes too high   'Cause she's got her own obligations, and so do I   Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones      Well, it's time for us to be leaving   And it hurts so much, it hurts so much inside   And now she'll go her way, I'll go mine   But tomorrow we'll meet at the same place, the same time   Me and Mrs., Mrs., Mrs. Jones   (Same place)   We both know that it's wrong   (Same time)   Everyday at the same place   (Same place)   We got a thing going on, you know it's wrong   (Same time)   But it's much too wrong   (Same place)   Me and Mrs. Jones.This is my Vietnam   I'm at war   They keep on dropping bombs   And I keep score      This is my Vietnam   I'm at war   Life keeps on dropping bombs   And I keep score      This is my Vietnam   This is my Vietnam.I don't mind,   You can think it over slow,   And tell me what you find..The bells are ringing out a little tune for you.Who were you thinkin' about?.Said, I just got paid today,   Got me a pocket full of change..The difference is in the way....Suffering has served you well -   It's common but it somehow sells   So sing your little songs of hell and sell..[Chorus x 2].Run into the house!.One little Christmas tree can light up the world   So all men may see on Christmas day.... We need some..And it's beguiling."
"To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need..Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah,   Tell me, tell me, tell me, yeah..God's gift I see that's moving up there into the night   Though dark the mirror in the sky reflects us our light:   Looks like a little brother to the sun   Or mother to the stars at night   And here it is and here it comes   Here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon..What can I say,   I never wanted it this way..Well you'd better not tell I've had a good night   Me and this bird she's a bit of alright   Dancing to the sounds as the arches get searched   She is the business for a bit of old skirt   It's so dirty when it's in the right mood   Give it some brandy and some chinese food   Take her for a spin with your stereo jack   Tell her she's the best girl you've ever had   Give it some gold to put round its neck   Bet here old man puts you on the deck   But its so dirty with me -

"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today..Come sit beside me in your way..You're Slim Shady, yes you're the real shady..Girl I know I been busy didn't get to talk   But don't let your head play them games with your heart   It's been a little crazy doing what I do   But I just can't wait to get up with you      I know it's been hard,

Every second I'm away from you feels like misery   Cause I know where I really wanna be      I know it's been hard, me not being there   Baby I don't want you thinking that I really don't care   And I know that you're feeling like I'm being unfair   But your love is with me everywhere      What do you do when you love someone so much   You'd do almost anything just for one touch   Try to make an excuse just to get away   That's the way that I feel about you baby   When I leave do you know what I go through   It makes me cry every time cause I miss you   And I hope you feel the same way too   Cause all I do is think of you.Do you love me?.Enter my dream, baby   Enter my dream      Jung river won't you stop for me awhile   Hold me like a sleepy child   And take me where I'm bound to be

dark angel   Deliver us from sorrow's hold   Or from my hard heart      I can't go on living this way   And I can't go back the way I came   Shamed of this fear that I will never find   A way to heal

I've been thinking a long time, my darling   Of the sweet words you never would say   Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish   For they say you are going away      Do you think of the valley you're leaving   O how lonely and how dreary it will be   And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking   And the pain you are causing to me      [Chorus]      They will bury me where you have wandered   Near the hills where the daffodils grow   When you're gone from the Red River Valley   For I can't live without you I know      [Chorus].Only if he's cured   Will his spirits future level ever

"Dear @CAPS1 of my local news paper: @CAPS2 you believe this garbage that the so called expert are saying about computers? I sure hope you don't! They are saying that computers are health risks because to many people are on them and not exercising, well if you risk me the users should know when to stop. And well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits. Also computers are very convient, if you need information on a topic right away. So there far I think computers are not the one's at, in this perdevment. Exercising is somthing a perosn should have the ambition to do. @MONTH1 people don't have this they spend their day on the computer. they claim its not their faut. the computer is a you to play it. I read just last week that someone actolly told her press they it is not fault her over weight. Thats ! So the only person at full. for not getting the the gamer. As us family interaction goes, all up to the parents the use the parents are in control over they child and if they are that their kid doesn't spend enough time. The operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits!. If we didn't have computers at home it would be a. Kids relie on computer them quick, accurate information. With not them the parents should their child to and from the library, and the time. And lets not forget the internet easy. So in conclusion computers are the way to go they are not the cause or however luck of exrcising at fault. Its not the computers fault familys. And they are just so convenit so clearly computer are good to have!

"Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors..Everything was moving around..Or only just tonight, dear?.Beans, beans, beans..Cadillac convertible with him   Hot shot at two A. M.

"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the computeres have on people. In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs. Computure or a prime source of the data base, of @CAPS4, criminal records and so much more. With out computures how could catch the bad guy or catch the cancer before it's too late. Computure are key in many things. in the end you could go all day about the pros & cons of computures. But there so key in major aspects today, the pros out weigh the cons..Though I dream in vain   In my heart it will remain   That stardust melody   The memory of love's refrain..Can you believe me?.So

love, a time for letting go      When you're standin' tall tomorrow   Looking back at yesterday   Through the memory of your sorrow   How the dawn was so far away   You'll be far beyond the shadow   Where hearts can learn to shine   And you'll realize the endless night   Was only a moment in time      [Chorus]      The night is long, the night is cold   With nothing to believe in   Just hold on

"Dear editor, I think that computers are a good thing to have in the house. They're very helpful and entertaining. For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. ""I love facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have facebook, skype, or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. ""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com,"" says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll. I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @CAPS1 everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is one of the most important things in the average home..Strong men fainted ""Ohh!""...(I thought I heard somebody cry--   I though I heard somebody cry)   I went to see what I could find   Like flowers in the dead of night   Like shadows in the moonlight--   I though I heard somebody cry   A choir with a single voice--A picnic on a cliff   Antenna like an insect--To pick up all your thoughts   CHORUS   It isn't true   I am not the ghost   Without a soul ..All of you know that the girls of the road   Are like apples you stole in your youth..There's no comprimising   And his eyes are black as the sky   For this bad, bad world he is going to die..Hammer!.Going to make a confession   Going to hope that you listen   I'm not a story you've read about   I'm just what I am      And when you open your eyes up   In the morning you rise up   Wash yesterday from your face   And make a new plan      Oh, it's my fascination, with the anticipation      If you want to grab a hold   If you want to grab a hold   If you want to grab a hold   Let it go....We go on and on   From dawn to dawn   The years have flown   Much faster than we know   And still in love we grow      Time has placed us here   Afraid of fear   We've seen through tears   That never should have come   And still in love we grow      Like a baby dove   Our love in time it's snowy wings unfold   To soar above   I'll stay another hour, another day   My whole life   As long as I feel this way   I'll stay with you and know   As long as I feel this way   In we'll grow.She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer..Just to sleep, just to sleep   Put them lighters up, up   Put them lighters up, up      My body is cold, I need your help   I'm coming down from a perfect spell   Can I take a hint of your love's device   Inhale the rum, you're just in time   Your fingertips leave me hypnotized   And when it hits my lips I am paralysed!.How could you?.Let it fall down, let it fall down, let it all fall down..Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors!.You!.Ah, but she's wonderful,   Set in the snow..Yeah.Lover, there will be another one   to hover over you beneath the sun..It's so lonely out tonight   And the feeling just got right   For a brand new love song   Somebody done somebody wrong song      Hey, won't you play another   Somebody done somebody wrong song   And make me feel at home   While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby      So play, play for me a sad melody   So sad that it makes everybody cry   A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong   'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone      So hey, won't you play another   Somebody done somebody wrong song   And make me feel at home   While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby      So, play, play for me a sad melody   So, sad that it makes everybody cry   A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong   'Cause I don't wanna cry all alone      Hey, won't you play another   Somebody done somebody wrong song   And make me feel at home   While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby      Somebody done somebody wrong song   And make me feel at home   While I miss my baby, while I miss my baby   I miss my baby.Shine....Heading home forever more   All past grief is now gone   The gift of life to me they bequest   Mine is the sight in the blindness   As I'm treading through the path, in darkness.I'm a rabbit in your headlights   Scared of the spotlight   You don't come to visit   I'm stuck in this bed      Thin rubber gloves   She laughs when she's crying   She cries when she's laughing      Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever trully marveles at the computers in our generation today? Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someonehas? Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children. In order to help the wee-being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours! This pretty much takes up a lot of time, so families can't spend time with one another. One important problem that children and teens face are @CAPS2 oover the intenet are people known as ""child predators."" @CAPS4 people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter @CAPS4 ""child predators; would you want to see your child be hurt by @CAPS4 horrible people? Computers are the reason, a with the internet for @CAPS4 accurances. Children and teens need to be protected from this major threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and thier lives. First, they don't allow people to be active and go outside. .Baby can you see,   How much you mean to me...   Can you see that I would die for you   Or are you just blind too?.Here we stand   Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two   Sleepless nights   Losing ground   I'm reaching for you, you, you

"Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing..Hate on me Hater, now or later,   Cause I'm gonna do me, you'll be mad baby..So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool   They just found your father in the swimming pool   And you guess you won't be going back to school   Anymore..Arsonists burnin people and they dogs up while they sleepin   Peepin toms peepin and poisonous gas leakin   Hurricanes blowin cities down every other weekend on the...

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to @CAPS2.com and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in @LOCATION1 then all this @CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'@CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'@CAPS3 do none of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people..Yes, no more next time..And even if it's not, you know I couldn't stop,   You make my heart go pow..My love, my heart   Oh bruised and broken, all alone when we're apart   I die inside,   Oh this room is like a battlefield of love tonight   I know I should be stronger but I lose all control   Fighting with myself tryna hide what you don't know      But I get weak   I'm giving it all away   I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but   All the rules get broken in your eyes   I give it all up to you   And everything that's been keeping me together   Brings me to my knees   I get weak      One look, one touch   Oh I'm helplessly pretending you don't mean that much   It gets so hard   The waiting here forever with this shattered heart   Lying to myself tryna act like I don't care, no   The way it's killing me every time that you're not there      Cause I get weak   I'm giving it all away   I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but   All the rules get broken in your eyes   I give it all up to you   And everything that's been keeping me together   Brings me to my knees   I get weak      I get weak   And all the walls I've been building up   Just crack and then break when you're around   I get weak   And nothing I do to fight it matters now      I get weak   I'm giving it all away   I know it's not wise to leave myself so opened but   All the rules get broken in your eyes   I give it all up to you   And everything that's been keeping me together   Brings me to my knees      I get weak (oh)   I get weak (oh)   I get weak (oh)      All the rules get broken in your eyes   I give it all up to you   And everything that's been keeping me together   Brings me to my knees.Tell me, can this be real?.Yeah, can you shine the light?.Hyde, Hyde..But the saddest thing is to see a woman weep..Oh no, Oh no   I can't believe that it's true   Oh no, Oh no   I can't believe that we're through   You tell me it's over and done   You say that you had all your fun   But I can't believe you'll be gone   As soon as I hang up the phone..Who knew?.Squeeze away each haunting fear,   And say the words I long to hear..By Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart   You know my girl just called me up   And she woke me from my sleep   You should have heard the things she said   You know she hurt my feelings deep..Hmm, and I know it looks like I've gone crazy..Oh yeah      I hug the air   When reality hits me   I wish some one was there      (Chorus)   These nights are sleepless,   These nights are cold,   Wish I could have somebody   Somebody to hold      Don't care if it's for one night,   I'll make do,   I just want somebody   Somebody to hold.Are there rustlers on the border or a band of Navajo?.Oh, who said I'd lied because I never?.All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard..Hey baby, I ain't askin' much of you   No no no no no no no no   Baby, I ain't askin' much of you   Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do      Don't be a stingy little mama   You're 'bout to starve me half to death   Now you can spare a kiss or two   And still have plenty left      Oh no no baby   I ain't askin' much of you   Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do   That's right      You're just a natural born beehive   Filled with honey to the top   But I ain't greedy baby   All I want is all you got      Oh no no   Baby, I ain't askin' much of you   Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do   That's right      I got a wishbone in my pocket   I got a rabbit foot around my wrist   I'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring   If you give me just a one sweet kiss      Oh no no no no no no no no   Baby, I ain't askin' much of you   Just a big a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do   Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do   Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do.Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast   And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost   And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign   ""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 ""   In the days of old, in the days of gold   How oft' times I repine for the days of old   When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49..People change, she goes away,   And you're left with nothing..CHORUS      I've seen you give me looks that I've read about in books,   And I finally had to make you play your hand..This should be nothin' to a love like what we got."
"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, ""@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends..I'm a bullet and I'm headed   Straight for you heart (yeah)   It's gonna leave a mark!.(just born to be your baby..You're my favorite girl   Are you?.I found a love, hidden in a backstreet   I found a love, baby   I found a love, hidden in a backstreet   Hidden away from the world, baby... ..

"Dear, @CAPS1-@ORGANIZATION1 Computers... they are sometimes bad and sometimes good they're like people. Computers are helpful on finding information, making your work less difficult. But at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family. Computers have so much information that the news paper in the future will no longer be known. Newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch. Because of computers instead of getting info of what happen yesterday in what area you live with the computer you can find out what intersting things happen yesterday in the whole world. But thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project. About as an example cells and with that computer it will help a lot more than you think no need to write all slopy just type of cell's were you can find in the internet, print done it just makes life way easier than just writing drawing finding info of cells in book that waste good time to go outside and play with friends and family. Computer like I said are sometimes bad like people and it also like a drug. Because look at computers when people go on website like, myspace, twitter, facebook, communicating website or game website, theres whay to much to name. Its a drug cause you to stay on it day to night you'll get stuck to it and can't get enough of it and some people won't stop and it hurts there family, friend and especially health, like drugs they cause all the same thing. I think I proved my point of why computers are sometimes bad and sometimes good like people..[Chorus:]   Somebody remind me where I am   That's right I'm at home, Yeah I'm right where I belong   Girl

adttitude adjustment   Oh It'll work every time      Well I've got this big 'ol brother-in-law   And me and him just never did get along   Because he wants to make sure   I'm treating his sister right   He got drunk one night   And started beating me up   And I went and got a tire tool   Out of my truck   And laid him out as cold as a block of ice      It was an attitude adjustment   And it will work every time   An attitude adjustment   I made him see the light   And he says I'm his kind of man   And he comes around with his hat in his hand   It was an attitude adjustment   I cured all his family pride      Now my girlfriend slapped me in the face   I said darlin that was you're first mistake   Then she went wild and her eyes turned red   She started breaking everything   And sceaming loud   And kickin me and cussin me out   And I gave her a little adjustment   On the top of the head      It was an attitude adjustment   Now she loves on me all the time   Just an attitude adjustment   She got a whole new frame of mind   She don't nag   And I don't beg   And we get along and like I said   Just an attitude adjustment   Oh everythings just fine   Well almost      She called the cops

"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society. I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today over use that power. You know what I mean @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts. Or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. People like the @CAPS4 do not spend much time with family members, or friends, or even just outside. They do not get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, physically or socially. Some people are working all day, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so that they rarely spend time with those they love. But if you are hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @MONTH1 just not spend enough time with family and friends. Using a computer isn't exactly a social thing. One person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. You @MONTH1 say ""@CAPS5, but there are also online social networks."" @CAPS5, but how often do you even see those people in real life? Computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. That certainly does not benefit society. A major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors. So you cannot be online chatting, or playing a game, or checking your email, outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. Sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors? Computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not well. That is the reason why pine tree's don't have outlets (although now you never know what they'll do next). Another side effect - that goes allong with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise. Once again, it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. When you live as a computer vegetable, your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be. Another reason computers could lower your quality of life. Now, really, if you use the computer sparingly, and only when you needed to, or when it is nessecary you would really have none at these ""side effects."" But face it, the ruth is, computers can be addicting. Wether it's waiting for a friend to come online or your trying to get to level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"", they can get you hooked. The idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers, but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting-springly. So, now you know, computers when used to much, at obsesive amounts, are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting. As long as you use them correctly, they are a very, very valuable tool to be used, but over used, can be problem causing, and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends, getting exercise and even spending time outdoors. I know you certainly will agree..Loose talk costs lives   People like to play   We're basically the same   We never lie   Loose talk costs lives      Don't look at me as if you don't remember me at

"I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. Therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. For example me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. If we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. Plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. My where you add up and subtract and divide. It's alot less words if you use a computer..What's the word?.Ooh, my little hungry one, hungry one   Open up a package of my bologna   Ooh, I think the toast is done, the toast is done   Top it with a little of my bologna      Never gonna stop, eat it up   Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up   But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo   M-m-m-my bologna      Spreadin' on the mustard now, show me how   Spread it on a litle of this bologna   Hopin' that we don't run out, don't run out   If we do I'm sure that I'll miss bologna      Never gonna stop, eat it up   Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up   But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo   M-m-m-my bologna   M-m-m-my bologna      (belch)      Goin' to the market now, market now   I'm the city's biggest bologna buyer   Walkin' down the shopping isles, shopping isles   Filling up my basket with Oscar Meyer      Never gonna stop, eat it up   Such a tasty snack I always eat too much, then throw up   But I'll soon be back for my, my, my, yi, yi, woo   M-m-m-m-m-m-m-my, my, my, yi, yi, woo   M-m-m-my bologna   M-m-m-my bologna   M-m-m-my bologna   M-m-m-my bologna.Show me some mercy..And I don't want to be a old man anymore   It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor   Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night   It's time I got back to the good life   It's time I got back, it's time I got back   'N I don't even know how I got off the track   It's time I got back, it's time I got back   'N I don't even know how I got off the track   I wanna go back, I wanna go back!.Solid brass statuary guards the door   Used to come as one, now it comes as four..Exiles running from each other   We are exiles, living undercover   Looking for another day to make it all work out   Exiles standing in the shadows   We are exiles, weary of the battles   Looking for another day to make it all work out      You sit there and I sit here   Looking at you used to be like looking in a mirror   But now it's dark, no light reflects   It never ends like one expects      I don't know where we went wrong   If I knew that I'd never had to write this song   But here we stand so far apart   Separate pieces of a broken heart      We live like exiles running from each other   We are exiles, living undercover   Looking for another day to make it all work out   Exiles standing in the shadows   We are exiles, weary of the battles   Looking for another day to make it all work out      You said you need time to think   But I just couldn't go on living on the brink   So now we take this frozen stance   In hopes that we'll find one more chance      Different wants and different needs   Moving through our changes at such different speeds   I don't know why and I don't know when   But somewhere we'll find love again      Exiles running from each other   We are exiles, living undercover   Looking for another day to make it all work out      Exiles running from each other   We are exiles, living undercover   Looking for another day to make it all work out   Exiles standing in the shadows   We are exiles looking for another day to make it all work out.Cause I am the captain of this ship,   Curious hands and fingertips..Oww!.forced injection..They're just holding your hand..I should know cause I've seen it before   I think I gotta let her go, she only loves in stereo!.How am I gonna tell you how I need you?.And a church is burning   The flames rise higher   Like hands that are praying a-glow in the sky   Like hands that are praying the fire is saying   ""You can burn down our churches but I shall be free."".Everybody got a harp..Come back, baby..Bless the roof and chimneys tall,   Let thy peace lie overall ..(Can you hear me now?).Yes, I breathed your love   And filled my heart in vain 'cause like rain   It slipped away, just like rain it swept away..When memories do call, I just, I just can't live without her   But tryin' all the time is so hard to bear..Tell me so that I understand      I just need some time   Gather all my thoughts   To make up for the love I just lost   You've been so good to me, given me everything   Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me      I woke up this morning with the hurting that I would never ever wish upon   Even my worst enemy   Who is she, what the hell do you people want?.The jungle near Manaus   The Amazonas full of piranhas   The birds of paradise   Disappear into the green desert   For years and years   We are hungry and desperate   For the only thing worth living   The excess   We end our Great Mission   Exhausted and sad   And there is no hope left   When suddenly   In a cloud of golden smog   The father of excess   Jumps out of the water of   The Amazonas full of piranhas   And screams to the lost souls      What are you doing at the Amazonas   Leave Manaus full of piranhas [burp!]"
"Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers..More honest words than these I?ll never find   With all my heart, my strength, my soul, my mind   I love You, I love

"Dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are good to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in other places or with your family or friends or meet with people from other country and you can become frinds. They are also good because they help to develop cordination on your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. First of all I think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other county or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. You can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls. Secondly the computers are helpful because they help you cordinate your hand and your eye. This helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; You will be able to finish it on time. From your point of view you can actually se were I'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. The hand cordination can help you develop mentally sight. Thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy thing like a clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online. In conclusion I think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to cordinate body parts don't you agree with me?.Louie, Louie, me gotta go..Lying thoughts tell me I'm lost not found..Yeah, I said yeah   I remember the first time   That I ever seen her face   I was standing by the drug store   Tryin' to save the human race      Took a raincheck on a blind date   To get her prescription filled   We had a short talk and a long walk   Through the lazy cottonfield      It was hot   She was cool and sultry   We made love   I was broke and lonely      She's wonderful, so beautiful   So delectable, she's mine   She's desirable, so lovable   And it's criminal, almost illegal      Well we woke up in a barnyard   When I heard a farmer shout   ""Get away, boy, from my daughter!"".Your qualities are true girl, ooh girl..Reaching out for the hand   Reaching out for the hand that smacked   Reaching out for that hand to hold   Reaching out for the Star   Reaching out for the Star that explodes   Reaching out for Mama..I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me..No one wants to hear about it now   Chocolate Rain!.[Interlude]   Thank you..Oh when we're teetering   On the edge of the collapse,   Nothing can keep us down..Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone..When there's no more looking back   And you feel you've loved in vain   You try and hide your sorrow   Now you're alone again   So you block out your emotion   Laugh it off and carry on   Sayin' why do i have to feel this way   Was loving you so wrong      If i could only turn around   One more time for old time's sake   I'd pick up all the pieces   From the mistakes i made   Did i give myself completely   Or did i hang on for too long   Ah, but what's the use of me talking this way   Now that you're gone      No looking back, it's over now   All over now   I tell myself i'm glad   It's over now   All over now   It's over now      But if i ever love again   Oh, i won't be played a fool   I'll put in my performance   This time i'll know the moves   It's not that i'm feeling bitter   I've no bitterness to show   And all i'm really trying to say   Is that i wish i'd never let you go.Make our lives turn out this way,   If they knew,   That we have got nothing to lose..I am not such a clever one   About the latest fads   I admit I was never one   Adored by local lads      Not that I ever try to be a saint   I'm the type that they classify as quaint      I'm old fashioned   I love the moonlight   I love the old fashioned things      The sound of rain   Upon a window pane   The starry song that April sings      This year's fancies   Are passing fancies   But sighing sighs holding hands   These my heart understands      I know I'm old fashioned   But I don't mind it   That's how I want to be   As long as you agree   To stay old fashioned with me      I'm old fashioned   But I don't mind it   That's how I want to be   As long as you agree   To stay old fashioned with me      Oh won't you stay old fashioned with me   Oh please stay old fashioned with me.But here come the people in grey,   To take me away..I can't be ooh what you want from me..I want some slow love   The kind that lasts forever   The kind of love that will be there in the morning   I want some slow love   The kind that leaves me never   The kind of love that lasts a long long time   Now don't mistake my coolness for a cold heart   I want you more than you should know   It's just these days I'm not inclined to move so fast   Why don't you stay a while say a hundred years or so   And make some slow love   The kind that lasts forever   The kind of love that will be there in the morning   I want some slow love   The kind that leaves me never   The kind of love that lasts a long long time   I'm not inclined to live a lifetime in one night   Although I long to touch I yearn for much, much more   A slow love   The kind that lasts forever   The kind of love that will be there in the morning   I want some slow love   The kind that leaves me never   The kind of love I thought I'd never find   The kind of love that lasts a long time.I'm hoping that I don't run out of breath, breath, yeah..God knows you're lonely souls   God knows you're lonely souls   God knows you're lonely souls   Yeah, yeah      I believe there's a time and a place   To let your mind drift and get out of this place   I believe there's a day and a place   That we will go to, and I know you want to share..Sp00l   Turn another turn!.Anything for you      Would you rob a shop?.You little shit you're in it now,   I hope they throw away the key."
"To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously needed in society. They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. Our teacher also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research. For example, last week in social students I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to @ORGANIZATION1- on the and sound a storage of information on the @NUM1 for my project on wehter capital punishment is and unusual. I found from this database that not onlt is it all lawed for that reason but the @LOCATION1 got from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which is instanly to carry the newest. most recent information I would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact. It would mre costly taken over two houses just to find the same information that five minutes using a computer. The internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method. As well as for research, school use computers to type papers. This moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check. Also, using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers. E-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are just @NUM2 of the commnly used websites on computers they make talking to friends and family easier and faster then ever. Last @DATE1 my friend on a business trip the was for @NUM3 weeks she missed him a lot @CAPS4 mom let @CAPS4 she was able to would have a telephone call. It consoled @CAPS4 for the @NUM4 days wasn't able to see @CAPS4 while still being amazing quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before. It is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them we don't need to worry about learning in life. Also in the closer future computer will be used in high school and college for helping paper researching and morw it will be faster and easier for us it we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventualy if can read the benefits are counters. As you can see, computers and the internet can any benefits iur society school can use them for many projects and learning People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face to face finally, it can help run the future.

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 editor, I have recently seen on the channel @NUM1 news that you want to know about the. Computers have on people. In the past, everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 agree computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination. Dr. @DR1 expert in relationship to humans said, ""People without computers cant do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination. The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. when you can't look up and learn about places, you are not about them. You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friend ships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you. .my breath away from me   How can I make her stay   My butterfly, fly away with me-e-e yeah   My heart was beating faster   She started to come near   Spread her wings around me   And cast out all my fears   My butterfly, fly away with me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e yeah   (Instrumental bridge and jam)   Now the bright light of her eyes show   She never was leavin?.Do not enter, conservative type..[Chorus]   Cos we're Tudors,   Britain's biggest feuders,   And just like barracudas,   We kill with methods foul..My mind is so unkind, my mind is so unkind..Hello!.All these crazy women,   One more crazy night..The style of your beautiful face   Drives me crazy..Fucking money, they on my penis?!.Not too long ago when she was mine   I thought we would be together 'til the end of time   That's the way it goes when you're in love   Since she's gone there's no one else I'm thinking of   [Chorus:]   I need her to stay with me   Lay me down and pray for me   Now I know just where I stand   Heaven help this lonely man      There will never be anyone else   Never be another one to take her place   Might as well give up, I can't go on   Never find another one to fill this empty space      Chorus      When she came to me she opened my eyes   Suddenly life was worth living   Now it's over for me I realize   Nothing's the same since she's gone   And I can't go on      Repeat.Peacemaker die   Peacemaker die   Peacemaker die   I don't know why?.(shoo-bop, shoo-bop, my baby)   (shoo-bop, shoo-bop)      Hello, stranger   (ooh) It seems so good to see you back again   How long has it been?.Comes to the cow   Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'.You better watch out   You better not cry   You better not pout   I'm telling you why      Santa Claus is comin' to town   Santa Claus is comin' to town   Santa Claus is comin' to town      He's making a list   He's checking it twice   He's gonna find out   Who's naughty or nice      Santa Claus is comin' to town   Santa Claus is comin' to town   Santa Claus is comin' to town      He sees you when you're sleeping   He knows when you're awake   He knows if you've been bad or good   So be good for goodness sake      So you better watch out   You better not cry   You better not pout   I'm telling you why      Santa Claus is comin' to town   Santa Claus is comin' to town   Santa Claus is comin' to town      The kids in girl and boyland   Will have a jubilee   They're gonna build a toyland   All around the Christmas tree      So you better watch out   You better not cry   You better not pout   I'm telling you why      Santa Claus (is comin' to town)   Santa Claus (is comin' to town)   Santa Claus is comin'   Santa Claus is comin'   Santa Claus is comin'   To town.Listening, learning and yearning to   Run, river, run..Erase them all and reclaim my place..It's time, it's time, it's time, let's go!.Is there anyone out there?.Suit your life, maybe so   In the White House-I know   All Over Berlin (they've been doing it for years)   And in Manhattan!.Dahmer is Dead   Dahmer is Dead   Bloody broomstick..Tore me all to pieces cut me half in two..She's always a lady   Just like a lady should be!"
"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom @PERSON1 was a size six in the waist. @PERSON1 would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. @PERSON1 quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (computer game) and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. @PERSON1 is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad @PERSON4. When @PERSON4 gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, @PERSON3 became a member of @CAPS4 @CAPS2, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when @PERSON3 was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, @CAPS7 take my suggestion seriously and bann computers..Just divorced was written   On the window of the car   It looked like a tombstone   Parked beside the local bar   Once he'd drove it crazy   Now he's driven it too far   Just divorced was written   On the window of the car      Someone wrote in soap   It's over right across the hood   On the door it said good riddance   Boy, I feel good   On the fender were the words   I won't be home tonight   And the jukebox in the bar played   If you're gonna do me wrong do it right   Laughed so hard I thought now   There's a guy who's got some spunk   What a sense of humor   It said goodbye on the trunk   Tin cans tied with paper streamers   Pointing to the bar   Just divorced was written   On the window of the car   Just divorced was written....Take it away!.Whoa-oh, Friday's child   Ya' cannot stop..Intro   Let me hear you Shout!!.I'll build my mold up, rest inside      Ink spills on paper, paper spells my blood..Bubbling up to the surface   Are you getting a breath of fresh air?.There is something I wanted to tell you,   It's so funny you'll kill yourself laughing   But then I, I look around,   And I remember that I am alone,   Alone..Run away, I can't stay..Silly boy boy (boy boy)   Acting acting silly boy?.- We'll get high   What will we touch there?.Don't take her for granted,   She had a hard time   Don't misunderstand her   Or play with her mind   Treat her so gently,   It will pay you in time   You've gotta know   She's the sensitive kind      Tell her you love her each and every night   You will discover she will treat you right   If you believe, I know you will find   There ain't nothin' like the sensitive kind      She gets so lonely waitin' for you   You are the only thing to help her through   Don't take her for granted   She has a hard time   You got to know she's the sensitive kind   You got to know she's the sensitive kind.It's twisted, it's true but I love the sick   mother..So when the sun goes down   An' those nights grow colder,   I will be there   Looking over your shoulder..I need Thy prescence every passing hour   What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power   Who like Thy Self my guide and stay can be   Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me..Candelabra's lighted   Satan has been sighted   Never has there been an evening like....Try to remember when life was so tender   When dreams were kept beside your pillow..And ooh if you're leaving..I'll try to rock and roll all night,   If there's some dough to be made   I wanna rock and roll all night,   But I get drowsy by eight..[Chorus]   Outrageous, when I move my body..I said, I couldn't tell you   I've lost mine      Words, words, words, have you heard   A bird in hand is much better than,   Any number free to wander   Fly away...stay   You pay for what you get   You pay for what you get      Everybody asks me how she's doing   Is she really all she says...

Everybody asks me how she's doing   Since she went away   I said I couldn't tell you   I'm OK I'm OK I'm OK (How are you?).As I breathe life into you   In a while my flower   Somewhere in a desert haze   I know one day you'll amaze me      An act of balancing, imagining the moment I can be   Looking deep into your eyes   For now a mystery   Or not at all   For who knows which way the wind is gonna blow   I'm waiting for your gentle whisper      Distant child, my flower   Are you blowing in the breeze?"
"Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs @NUM1 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer @NUM2 its bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go me go on the computer, but she @CAPS1 makes me go outside and run around @CAPS1 people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger chilld the wrong ideas. For example I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad peole post videos and the little children could see then and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time and with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad..Still searching for that boy who had the faith to move a mountain..Some like it hot, I like it red!.Will be there after you're gone..Try to understand..Goodbye Norma Jean   Though I never knew you at all   You had the grace to hold yourself   While those around you crawled   They crawled out of the woodwork   And they whispered into your brain   They set you on the treadmill   And they made you change your name      And it seems to me you lived your life   Like a candle in the wind   Never knowing who to cling to   When the rain set in   And I would have liked to have known you   But I was just a kid   Your candle burned out long before   Your legend ever did      Loneliness was tough   The toughest role you ever played   Hollywood created a superstar   And pain was the price you paid   Even when you died   Oh the press still hounded you   All the papers had to say   Was that Marilyn was found in the nude      And it seems to me you lived your life   Like a candle in the wind   Never knowing who to cling to   When the rain set in   And I would have liked to have known you   But I was just a kid   Your candle burned out long before   Your legend ever did      Goodbye Norma Jean   Though I never knew you at all   You had the grace to hold yourself   While those around you crawled   Goodbye Norma Jean   From the young man in the twenty second row   Who sees you as something more than sexual   More than just our Marilyn Monroe      And it seems to me you lived your life   Like a candle in the wind   Never knowing who to cling to   When the rain set in   And I would have liked to have known you   But I was just a kid   Your candle burned out long before   Your legend ever did   Your candle burned out long before   Your legend ever did.You could tell me a lot..I'm gonna give you more   Than you ever dreamed possible..I'm alive, I'm alive         I'm alive - and the dawn breaks across the sky   I'm alive - and the sun rises up so high   Lost in another world (far away), never another word (till today)   But what can I say?.Some say that hell is heaven..[Outro]   Just like fire, burning out the way,   If I can light the world up for just one day (one day!.I won't feel like like I'm on the outside of a circle.When love gets old it grows cold   And then true love will fade away   And then true love will fade away   And then true love will fade away   True love fades away   True love fades away   True love fades   True love fades   True love fades away..How many times have I seen you running   Just one step ahead of the past?.[Alan Jackson:]   I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill   [Clint Black:]   And I know a spot right over the hill   There's soda pop and the dancin's free   So if you want to have fun come a- long with me..I finally found some employment, feeding pigs on a farm,   I wasn't treated to kindly, I had to sleep in the barn,   I had to eat with the swine,   The bread I ate was like stone,   It didn't take too much time until, I was dreaming of home..Can't you see   When you do the things you do   If I can't conceal   The thrill that I'm feeling,   Don't blame me..Why should I hate you?.When I drink my potion my character changes,   My whole mind and body rearranges,   This strange transformation takes place in me,   Instead of myself everybody can see...

"New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers is a benefit to society. Most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them. No matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eys off the screen. Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isnt' all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicans put together. If you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plety of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing whats going on. Do you like to stay organizes I personally, think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people need the computer to do their job and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working humans is a larger amount. So, thing about it, if computers weren't made, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would not have, jobs, or they would have to keep everything down on paper which @MONTH1 be a catastrophe. After a while, you @MONTH1 want to back everything up by copying all of your photos, files, music ect. to a @CAPS4 so you dont loose everything if your computer shuts down.

This is a perfect way for communication and business. My final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and you really wanted to see them, then you can go on your computer and see the news and learn new things and see what bad things have happened. Also if you live some where that isn't your home town, then you can go online and see what is going on at your hometown and visit for any special occassions.

Computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries. If you have a computer, then that is great.

"Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves. This is why I think that comperters aren't positive in society..   As I look at the morning sky   Today the wind is blowing hard   See that bird has flown too high   Pretty soon it will be tired   I spent a day all by myself   A rich man without his wealth   Sometimes I get it wrong   But I'm not the only one      The afternoon was very clear   The sun was beating down on me   I got thirsty for a beer   That I had to go to sea   The sea was very rough   It made me feel sick   But I like that kind of stuff   It beats arithmetic      I don't want the world to change   I like the way it is   Just give me one more wish   I can't get enough of this   When it gets to be alive   And not just still survive   To hit and not to miss   I can't get enough of this      The early evening mist   Looked beautiful to me   Was sweeter than a kiss   I wish you all could see   I'm a long long way from home   But this photograph of you   Even though it's monochrome   Tells me what I should do   So I got up on my feet   And I knew it would be alright   For my clothes were looking beat   In the middle of the night      I don't want the world to change   I like the way it is   Just give me one more wish   I can't get enough of this   When it gets to be alive   And not just still survive   To hit and not to miss   I can't get enough of this      I don't want the world to change   I like the way it is   Just give me one more wish   I can't get enough of this   When it gets to be alive   And not just still survive   To hit and not to miss   I can't get enough of this      I can't get enough of this   I can't get enough of this   I can't get enough of this   I can't get enough of this   I can't get enough of this   I can't get enough of this   I can't get enough of this   I can't get enough of this.Nothing in this world is for real   Except you are

"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work. Overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer. But, some times it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1. Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line. Also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @CAPS1. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @CAPS3 be bullyed at their safe place, their home. Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise. A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said ""every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers."" @CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. Lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students. Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend to much time all the computer. I was waching discovery chanel and it said that @CAPS3 most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework. The computer made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!.No time to lose, please don't be tardy,   Tomorrow night at the Swing Cats' Hall..Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen   I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches   A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy   Do not go to Feingold's, though   The pickles are rubber   And I will not be harmin' yah   I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it   I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah   Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada   Daddy from Africa   Both of best worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya'   Challah!.Cold hard fact gonna put it in ya back yeah!.Can you feel your heart?.On stranger waves, the lows and highs,   Our vision touched the sky,      Immortalists with points to prove,   I put my trust in you..I've been tryin' for a long, long time   But no matter what I do   When I turn to leave, my heart stays behind   'Cause I can't get over you      I keep movin' on, runnin' hard and fast   But everywhere that I run to   I'm just standin' still, living in the past   'Cause I can't get over you      If memories were like the leaves that fall   The wind would have carried them from my mind   The seasons pass, but they never change   A broken heart can't keep time      I've watched as colors faded in the sun   The colors of my love stay true   I've been letting go now, I'm not holdin' on   I just can't get over you   I just can't get over you.And next we      Were moving on   And he was with me   Yeah, with me   And we were moving on      And singin' that   Same old song   Yeah, with me      Singin'   I love rock 'n' roll   So put another dime   In the jukebox      Baby   I love rock 'n' roll   So come and   So come on take the time   And dance with me      Ow   I love rock 'n' roll yeah   'Cause it soothes   My soul yeah      I love rock 'n' roll   Yeah, yeah, yeah      I said, ""Can I take you home   Where we can be alone?"".Give you my lovin'   Seven days a week   I'll be your honey   If you'll be sweet   I know I'm the only one for you   I know that you think this is not true      Man says it's rainin'   Rainin' outside   I'll be out there in a little while   'Cause you see   Rain reminds me of you   And everything has turned to you      See you in places   I'm following you   You'll be upstairs   And I'll be there too   Everywhere you go   I will follow   I know it won't be the same tomorrow      People give me warnings   Stay away from you   They say you'll hurt me   I don't think that's true   Discomfort arouses when I speak of you   As if you've been sayin' something bad   About me      When I see you   I want to kiss you   But I know that ain't right   So I ask if I can hold you   Oh babe I need you so bad   Oh babe I only want to make you   Glad.Hold me tight...What a long, long time..Each heart is a pilgrim,   Each one wants to know   The reason why the winds die   And where the stories go..Yeah we used to sing...

"Dear @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I understand you think computers don’t have an effect on people. Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. It also helps you with your work. Never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decition that you want to make..Get the need   Get it..I've got every feeling we felt when touched..I solve my problems and I see the light   We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right   There ain't no danger we can go to far   We start believing now that we can be what we are      Grease is the word      They think our love is just a growing pain   Why don't they understand, It's just a crying shame   Their lips are lying only real is real   We stop the fight right now, we got to be what feel   Grease is the word   It's got groove it's got meaning   Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion   Grease is the way we are feeling      We take the pressure and we throw away   Conventionality belongs to yesterday   There is a chance that we can make it so far   We start believing now but we can be who we are      Grease is the word   It's got groove it's got meaning   Grease is the time, is the place is the motion   Grease is the way we are feeling      This is the life of illusion   Wrapped up in trouble, laced with confusion   What are we doing here?.There is no better time, I'm talking here and now, I'm talking here and now   Let's go!.You see before you a truly broken man..You been good to me baby   Better than I been to myself, hey!.I'm happy to say I had better to do   What about China?.But we're already one   Already one   Now only time can come between us   'Cause we're already one   Our little son won't let us forget..I've looked at love that way   Now that's just another show we've been laughing when you go      If you care don't let them know don't give yourself away   I've looked at love from both sides now from give and take and still somehow   It's love's illusion I recall I really don't know love at all      Tears and fears and feeling proud say I love you right out loud   Dreams and schemes and circus crowds I'd look at life that way   Now old friends are acting strange..Got a little story   I think you should know..And why does the cheatin' go on?.Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve      Maybe I'm crazy to suppose, I'd ever be the one you chose   Out of a thousand invitations you'll receive   Oh, but in case I stand one little chance   Here comes the jackpot question in advance   What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?.Our story?s so old, again has been told   On the past let's close the door   And smile, don't regret but live and forget   There's no use to try anymore.I got to keep moving, I got to keep moving   Blues falling down like hail, blues falling down like hail   Mmm, blues falling down like hail, blues falling down like hail   And the day keeps on remindin' me, there's a hellhound on my trail   Hellhound on my trail, hellhound on my trail   If today was Christmas eve, if today was Christmas eve   And tomorrow was Christmas day   If today was Christmas eve and tomorrow was Christmas day   All I would need is my little sweet rider   Just to pass the time away, to pass the time away   You sprinkled hot foot powder, mmm, around my door   All around my door   You sprinkled hot foot powder, all around your daddy's door   It keeps me with ramblin' mind rider   Every old place I go, every old place I go   I can tell the wind is risin', the leaves tremblin' on the tree   Tremblin' on the tree   I can tell the wind is risin', leaves tremblin' on the tree   All I need is my little sweet woman   And to keep my company, hey, hey, hey, hey, my company.Pretty one, has no one told you,   I love you..Are tender and sweet   This song as my lead,   I know the voice, I know the touch,   Lover of my soul..We shall fight in France   We shall fight over the seas and oceans..Pick up your things you're a star.Flesh wound, flesh wound   With medication it will fade   Should I assume that someone hears me when I pray   Full of hate   Don't you love how I pray?.Who defeats my fiercest foes?.Oh, William, William it was really nothing   William, William"
"I think that computers have a good effect on people. When people are on the computer they are not on for very long. I also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new technology. Computers are positive and they can help you when you are stuck or need to look something up. To me computers are positive. When people go on the computer ther are not on for @NUM1 hours straight. Sure they might be on @NUM1 hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school, meals and activities. Some people need computers for their @CAPS1. News @CAPS2 companies need computers for editing and printing out the papaer. They also put the news on there website. What would most people do without a computer? Computers are positive because of the new technology! The new technology is helping people interact over the. if you have a long distance friend or family member, there are how many ways to talk to them. You could use @CAPS3, skype, oovoo, @CAPS4 or even email. When I go on the computer I dont just sit and watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or @CAPS7 online. I interact with my friends @PERCENT1 of us population between the ages @NUM3 have a @CAPS3. @PERCENT2 have skype or oovoo and talk to people that are too far away to visit. Computers are positive because they can help you with school that you don't know just go on the internet and look it up if you need to translate @CAPS8 to @CAPS9 just go on the computer and translate it. @PERCENT3 of people learned a dictionary there own using the internet. If there is a word you want to know and isn't i the dictionary look it up and it will be online. Computers have a positive effect on people. Nobody spends so much time on the computer that they can't go outside or hang out with there friends. People actually need the computer for their @CAPS1 the new technology that is coming out is letting people interact with people across the world. They are positve to have for school work, definitions and even translation. Computers are not negative and they dont take away what you should do in life..[Chorus].(I don't love you...)

"My is people should go only on the computer if they really have to do something such as type a reports, check your e-mail etc. Whats the point of going on the computers if all your going to do is play games that gets boring to me. I go on the computer to to my friends and check email and stuff and then i go outside to play. You should only be on the computer for @NUM1 minutes a day then go get some exercise. If you stay on the computer all day you will smell, get fat, get lazy, and no one wents these things. These are the things you should have. You can play basketball, go on a bike ride, with some friends, go swimming, I do this type of stuff every day and I am in good shape because of it. I stay healthy and fit I dont sit on the computer all day on a sunny day. You become more if you go more it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids. When I get home every day I do my homework then I go outside and play, then later I go on the computer for @NUM1 minutes then @CAPS1 done and I go to bed and the same thing the next day.

"Have you ever gone on the computer? Have you ever sat there on the computer for a long time? I am writing you because I am concerned with the health of the town. @CAPS5 people have computers and go on them daily. It @MONTH1 be fun, but it could also but your health. Computers can be addicting and cause us to play for hours. @CAPS5 people @CAPS4 not exercise at all anymore. Most are too busy on thier computer. You should have at least @NUM1 minutes of exercise each @CAPS4. ""@CAPS1 kids sholud have anywhere from @NUM2 min of exercise on average per day. A lot of kids are now playing video games on the computers for that time instead of exercising,"" says @CAPS2. sereno. @CAPS5 kids don't go outside enough either. Did you know you should have a minimum of @NUM3 min in sunlight each day? You get most of your vitamins. the sun. When was the last time you took a bike, went camping, or went to the beach? All are very fun things to @CAPS4 that you could be missing out on learning of the computer. I know I absolutly love going to the beach. Hearing the waves, & laughing @CAPS3 ocean waters, and feeling it cool as the is just heaven. If I was on the computers all the I would be able to enjoy. My most thing @CAPS4 you like having fun or going out to your family? I @CAPS5 computer dont to are the same as being with the person. Can you imagine never actually seeing or hearing the person you're talking to? Thats now it is with @CAPS6. @PERCENT1 of communication on the billions of people who have @CAPS7't you rather talk to the person on the phone or talk face to face? I feel people should spend time exercising, going outdoors, and spending time with friends and family. Remember @NUM1 minutes of exercise, @NUM3 minutes in the sun each day to stay really healthy.

there inside you   Always, in all ways   I'll be there beside you   For always, in all ways.Don't wait up, don't wait up!.Cast my boat out to the ocean   And set it sails to the wind   Gentle breeze blowing into my heart   I'm alive in this gentle world   A life carefree   A life carefree   And in this love that you give me   You have to share the joy and mystery   The wonder of your smile   And the power of your words   That changes me   That changes me   Sometimes I could fly   When your heart it touches mine   Deep into the blue   Where my soul is lost   And all because of you   Gave my heart to another love   Crashing waves of pain came over me   In my distress you came and rescued me   Still the storm talked away   Of life carefree   Of life carefree   Sometimes I could fly   When your heart it touches mine   Deep into the blue   Where my soul is lost   And all because of you   When I found myself far away from you   That's when I hear your voice   Reminding me, calling me, lifting me   Out into the blue   Out into the blue   Sometimes I could fly   When you heart it touches mine   Deep into the blue   Where my soul is lost   And all because of you.There we sit on a line, wasting fortunes at a time, and pray..these same people who deplore th   El of current popular songs and yet will sit around enthralled singing jimmy crack corn and I don't care or green grow the rushes, oh!.Twenty four hours a day?.And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me   Afraid of comin' in last..The beautiful lull,   The dangerous tug   We get to feel small   From high up above   And after a glimpse   Over the top   The rest of the world   Becomes a gift shop      The pendulum swings   For the horse like a man   Out over the rim   Is ice cream to him   The beautiful lull,   The dangerous tug   We get to feel small   But not out of place at all      We're forced to bed   But we're free to dream   All us human extras,   All us herded beings   And after a glimpse   Over the top   The rest of the world   Becomes a gift shop      I don't know what to believe,   Sometimes I even forget   And if it's a lie,   Terrorists made me say it   The beautiful lull,   The dangerous tug   We get to feel small   From high up above      From high up above.There is no life no life without its hunger   Each restless heart beats so imperfectly   But when you come and I am filled with wonder   Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity      You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains   You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas   And I am strong, when I am on your shoulders   You raise me up, to more than I can be   You raise me up, to more than I can be.Javert   I have known the thief for ages   Tracked him down through thick and thin   And to make the matter certain   There's the brand upon his skin   He will bend, he will break   This time there is no mistake..Well, I don't know   Who do you love?.Old records never die..On a rainy day      Just let a smile be your umbrella   On a rainy, rainy day   And if your sweetie cries, just tell her   That a smile will always pay      Whenever skies are gray   Don't you worry or fret   A smile will bring the sunshine   And you'll never get wet      So, let a smile be your umbrella   On a rainy, rainy day      Just let a smile be your umbrella   On a rainy, rainy day   And if your sweetie cries, just tell her   That a smile will always pay      Whenever skies are gray   Don't worry or fret   A smile will bring the sunshine   And you'll never get wet      So, let a smile be your umbrella   On a rainy, rainy day      Just let a smile be your umbrella   On a rainy, rainy day   On a rainy, rainy day   On a rainy, rainy day.She stood on the tracks   Waving her arms   Leading me to that third rail SHOCK   Quick as a wink   She changed her mind..Strange, how you stopped loving me!.Yea, the light on your portrait and the light in your face   And you'll be looking for another pretty place   Baby, this side of the street..Don't stop 'til I start to squeal....kiss the future."
"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention! They allow you to do so many different things. They have alot of positive effects on people. Computers deal with all sorts of things, from hand-eye cordination, learning about faraway places and people, to talking online with anyone. Come on in to the wonderful world of computers. Computers have a super positive effect on people. They help teach hand eye cordination. You can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse. You can see where it's going just by looking at the screen. Doing this helps everyday skills like playing sports. If you can use your eyes and your hands at a you can hit a baseball or even. Computers teach hand eye cordination by being able to do two things at. Would it be amazing if you could just find a recipe go to? Well, you You could simple A computer helps people different things. It's also easy different culture, people, and places. Let's say you @CAPS2 and you. A computer gives you any learn something. Computers and almost everyday.

Further sites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6 or @CAPS7 where you have you own page post your own opinions. You also have friends page to see how you are doing. These sites give people a chance to find with old friends. Webcam is becoming a huge sensation! Sites like or skype let you see and talk to the other person. They allow you to talk to people that you @MONTH1 and feel that they are there with you. Computers benefit people all over the world. but that doesnt. Computers help people physically by being able to learn new things, and with being able to computers arent taking over are only helping them..Dip, dip, dip low..She was just a country girl   Didn't

"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in would floor. Surely, computers allow you @CAPS2 my cousin on the computer and @CAPS3 important to note that, on computers you can play games that can help you with your school-work. You can go on sites that you on your @CAPS4. Show you how your body works for @CAPS5, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are not boring. This a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didnt. The time is now! Just think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because no matter what, people will always have time for that..The child is father to the man   I guess my fate is sealed..Ride beside..Day tripper, day tripper, day tripper..The sun is sleeping quietly   Once upon a century   Wistful oceans calm and red   Ardent caresses laid to rest      For my dreams I hold my life   For wishes I behold my night   The truth at the end of time   Losing faith makes a crime      I wish for this night-time   to last for a lifetime   The darkness around me   Shores of a solar sea   Oh how I wish to go down with the sun   Sleeping   Weeping   With you      Sorrow has a human heart   From my god it will depart   I'd sail before a thousand moons   Never finding where to go      Two hundred twenty-two days of light   Will be desired by a night   A moment for the poet's play   Until there's nothing left to say      I wish for this night-time      I wish for this night-time.goes another kanga   On the bonnet of the van..And I move up from the country,   Oh I never could have stayed..Why don't you rock my soul?.(Lee) We're only mocking about..Left New Hyde Park   to hold my own in New York Town   Groped in the dark   Until I faced a place where scallywags are found   Sharks and yo-yos everywhere   I think you can take it from there   Now there's a horse in town   I scream: Honey it's just a clown   Yes there's a horse in town   Saddle up and ride, ride, ride   Can you reveal   The day you came, the day you'll go   This way I feel   The time is moving much too slow   And it passes by your chair   If you laugh at my despair   [Chorus]   [Solo]   The shoes of my friend   They stamp the nail into the ground   Let's not pretend   We know we've all had fearsome style   Following my frozen trail   Moving to the inside rail   [Chorus].I said it looks like everybody in this whole round world   Are all down on me..This is my life      Whatever happened is over now for you..(for-)      [Chorus].It was one of those nights, one of those nights when   you feel the world stop turnin', you were standing   There, there was music in the air..I am the beat of your pulse   The computer word made flesh   We are one you and I   We are versions of the same   When you can see what I feel   Don't turn your back on me   Or you might find that your dreams   Are only program cards      Your mind is open for me   Open for intake of all propaganda   Your Eyes see now what to see   My eyes see only the programs you give me      I'll teach you to laugh and to cry   They're really the same you'll see   All of the why's in your life   Are under my control   Feed me more lines   I will try to tell you all I can   Before the light you must know what lies   Behind my screams      I can't tell you all I know   Am I the son that you've always been wanting   There's more to me than what shows   Are you my father   The one that was promised      Hush now, I'll give all you need to know   and pre-live your dreams for you   You're a good boy      Freedom belongs only to those   Without video screens   For eyes and mouth      You have no voice   To be heard my son   No one can hear when you're   Screaming in Digital      I'm not your slave   You can't control my emotions   No Father, please let me keep learning      Can't you see I'm human   Can't you tell      I'm not your slave   Oh Father no   Please don't keep me from dreaming   Oh can't someone hear.I'll be waiting,   I'll be waiting,   I'll be waiting for you..Melting in the sunbeams   from my maker's eyes..But I will not hesitate to euthanize if the grass becomes greener on the other side..We're all looking good out here!.Changes, visible changes   Sky looking so forlorn   It looks like the world's been born   On one more rainy day      Trying to see the sunlight   My heart's crying out loud   I try to see through the clouds   On one more rainy day      One more rainy day   Once again my mind is gray   This is what a rainy day can do   One more rainy day   One more rainy day      Sun starts shining on through   New day a day with you   It's strange what sun can do   On one more rainy day      One more rainy day   Once again my mind is gray   This is what a rainy day can do   One more rainy day   One more rainy day.I can only pray   Take my sun away, away..I finally found somebody."
"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has made great improvements in the past years. Computers have now found a home in all most every buisness and home in @LOCATION1! Everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not.. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined and peole should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning? Name the fatest country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? The answer to all @ORGANIZATION1 those questions is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies done by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. @ORGANIZATION1 those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are over weight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function and helps burn off unnessecary calories. People most definately need to get off the computer and exercise more. They might even like it. Spending time with your family can be great fun, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school,"" @CAPS4 @PERSON2 beyond. So what's stopping them?, Computers. Kids now find many internet sites online online more interesting than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn @ORGANIZATION1 the computers, bring out the board games and keep @CAPS5 families together! ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have,"" @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS6 wasting money on? You guessed it; computers. The average bill per month is @MONEY2. In a whole year your paying @MONEY1 for something you don't need! Computers also waste space. Along with needing a place to house your monitor, you have to find room to cram a printer, the hardrive AND all those wires. Who can find enough room?! I certainly can't. Although technology, namely computers, can be a wonderful thing, we need to look at the downside. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart and the economy collapses, all because @ORGANIZATION1 computers.

"Dear @CAPS1, I belive that computers benefits the people of today. The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had recived information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to comunicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remeber my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the . Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2-obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and excersising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they myt entertain themselves indeers. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privleges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormouse benifits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students whith school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside. I hope that this letter had convinced you of the benefits of computers..bullshit!.Oh ho   No other love will I share 'cause none, none could compare   After loving you..I'll give it a try,   Cause I'm

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone..I can take it, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you..A come on, baby,   Let me see how you work..[Chrous:]   Take me to your heart,   Never let me go..Ho, please!.I stopped by the church that I used to go inside but even that door was locked..Do you know   Does it show   When I'm low   And then again, when I feel your love from far away, I think of yesterday   I see a family we know how to smile   There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along   There comes a time when we will walk that mile   Stand up, turn around, beat it out   You gotta sound, Joe   Swing low and now I know   It's hard to let a brother go, Joe   Stand up, turn around, beat it out   You gotta sound, Joe   Swing low and now I know   It's hard to let a brother go, Joe.J's'rai la pour toi..Am I about knowledge or about brains?.Some people laugh when they need to cry,   and they never know why..What do you want from me,   what is it you expect   I have spoken my mind from deep inside my soul   Behind the eyes is a place on one will be able to touch   Containing thoughts that cannot be taken away or replaced   You want what is not yours, Jealousy   You want what you cannot have, Jealousy   Spiteful harsh words, it comes as no real surprise..Yeah I got the shakes,   I've got the hippy, hippy shake..And people seem to notice every time I do smile..Ooooo-hoooh..It's too late to pry away..Well you prove it to me and I'll prove it to you      Now every night you go out looking for true love's satisfaction   But in the morning you end up settling for just lights, camera, action      And another cameo role with some bit player you're befriending   You're gonna go broken-hearted looking for that happy ending   Well girl you're gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold   Cryin' alone in the theater as the credits roll      You say I'll be like those other guys   Who filled your head with pretty lies   And dreams that can never come true   Well baby you be true to me   And I'll be true to you.Hey, hey, so I guess I'm doin' fine..Sleepy time, and I lie,   With my love by my side,   And she's breathing low..Back the fuck away from it and leave it where it lies   How many stabbings can it take before it dies   I got the message like a bullet to the head   No wishful thinking now to help bring back the dead      I never noticed as you turned into a ghost   You couldn't help me when I needed you the most   You made your choice, you would not change your course   I got a lesson how to flog a dying horse      On Easter I got a chocolate rabbit   Biggest one I ever had   You never know 'till you've bitten off their head   If they're hollow and the chocolate's bad.Baby when the night starts slipping   When the night starts slipping   When the night starts slipping away   Boy you got my heartbeat skipping   When you touch me even though   The time is ticking away   Just tell me it's not over   And we'll never reach the end   But when the night starts slipping away,   Save the day      De de de de de de day   De de de de de de day   De de de de de de day   Save the day   De de de de de de day   De de de de de de day   De de de de de de day   Save the day      Yeah we're still wide awake   Got me losing my mind, my mind   No, it's never too late,   Put your lips on mine   In the burning sunlight, I   I can't believe that my body is still moving   It makes me feel like we're doing something right..I am just a lousy bum   Searching for the unknown crumb   The crumb the crumb   Something or someone to come      Come along illuminate my lust   Combust   Confucius might have been confused   And Buddha might have blown a fuse   I ooze the muse      Meet me at the coffee shop   We can dance like Iggy Pop   Another go in the parking lot   Frewak the cheek on your hot spot      Back and forth my body's jerking   Will to thrill will not stop working   Work and work   I'll take you on a honeymoon   Jumping on a bed in a hotel room   The room the groom      Meet me at the coffee shop   We can dance   Like Iggy Pop   Another go in the parking lot   Frewak the cheek on your hot spot.The pain has gone."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers do benefit society because computers can do alot of things like teach you. Computers are very helpful now, mostly every thing gets done on it. The computer teaches good eye cordination, how to focus, and show you stuff you don't know about. Without an computer you really can't get any thing done or reddy. A computer can be helpful for lots of things like job aplications of taxe's, or at a grocry store register, typeing and being on the computer is exercising but not for your body. When your on a computer exercise your hand's and your brains. With out computers you really cant do any thing. Mostly everything you do in life have to deal with some type of computer. I think that the people that said they shouldnt be on the computer is wrong because they can interact with there family that's far away thats also on the. You can enjoy nature by just takeing a look old you don't have to walkt out. Thats why I think computers are positive and helpful..Are.!.You and me baby, well we got no friends   Except for you and me baby   This is journey's end   And I try to hang on to all those precious

"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefits the society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and it teaches people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world throughout everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the @LOCATION1 has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school I know that from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study in a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer know that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That's because with all the and websites it will teach us hand-eye coordination with I'm just having fun. Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy to use it. That's ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, than nothing does. As I have shown, computers deffinitly do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because it gives people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand-eye coordination. In conclusion, computers have a strong effect on people today..See what I'm talking bout sweet heart   You ain't even gotta have John Madden   You ain't gotta have Dick Vitale,   You ain't gotta Lee Carsole   You ain't gotta have Stuart Scott,   You ain't gotta have Linda Cohn   Know what I'm talking bout,   You ain't gotta have the staff of E-S-P-N   You ain't gotta have ABC staff just to talk sports baby   Cause I got game sweetheart   Just fuck with the boy and I'll get you a jersey   What you want me to put on the back   Daddy's little that's right,   See what I'm talking bout   I can't give you the game   But I can show the game   And you can see what you see   And peek how you peek and get what you get   Know what I'm talking bout   Weezy.You've called me, I will follow,   Your will for me I'm sure..Never dreamed   That a home could be   Dark and cold,   I was told,   Every day in my childhood   Even when we grow old   Home should be where the heart is   Never were words so true   My heart's far far, away   Home is too..Take it nice and easy..Rock on!.Ready for count-down: 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 -

"Click click, another information page opens up on your handy @LOCATION4 these trusty, smart, and easy to use divices are always a object to have. Although, people are now starting that these handy desktops are bad for your well-being oposing that people strongly think that we dont get enough exercise or outdoor activitys in. Well computers are such a great entertainment system also, have a vast information supplie, and even allow socialization with friends/ family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 payers are no match for the internet and it's great wide spread entertainment system. The computer has all of the faimly fun movies, itunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse. The internet is the obvious best reason for a faimly movie night. One of the greatest pro about the internet is the vividsorce of information. Google, wikipedia, or even dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the @DATE1. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun I would rather learn about a sunny beach of @CAPS2 or the great landscape of @LOCATION1. If your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the @CAPS3 is a sure easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in @LOCATION2 or germany. The answer is simple, skype, fiacebook, myspace and more are all available on your handy @CAPS3. Many sites have a no fee polocy so they cant charge them money for social living with friends. As a personal experience I could now talk to my cousins wqho live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 due to the great interaction site of facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that thier even there. Obviously internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends. I'm people will open thier eyes see the great uses of the computer..Ahh yeah..Nothing could be finer   Than to be in Carolina in the morning   No one could be sweeter than my sweetie   When I meet her in the morning   Where the morning glories twine around the door   Whispering pretty stories, I long to hear once more   Strolling with my girlie   Where the dew is pearly early in the morning   Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each little buttercup at dawning   If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day   I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say   Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning   Where the morning glories twine around the door   Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more   Strolling with my girlie   Where the dew is pearly early in the morning   Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each little buttercup at dawning   If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day   I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say   Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning.[Kelly]   No more midnight rides with you   No more secret rendezvous   I'm gonna miss all the things we'll never do   I just can't believe you left me here alone   How in this world can I make it on my own      [Kalan]   Remember I love you, I won't be far away   Baby, close your eyes and think of yesterday   And we'll be there together   Love will turn back the hands of time   Whoa oh turn back   Whoa oh turn back the hands of time      [Kelly]   Whoa oh baby don't you know it's hard to let you go      [Kalan]   Save all your dreams and keep me in your heart      [Kelly]   It hurts to say goodbye no matter how I try      [Kalan]   Love will survive even though we have to part      [Spoken]      Stephanie please don't cry..Tempo sees Ed not feeling his best..You are one in a million   You are one in a million   You are oh love my love   You are everything for me   You are one in a million   You are one in a million   You caught me with your charms   When you held me in your arms      Oh lonely life, I hear your heartbeat   Deep in the night   I need you so   Know that I can't let you go   Dim all the lights and let me hold you so tight   The night is yours and mine   You're looking fine   Just tonight      Just like a child   You're sometimes weak, sometimes you're wild   You understand, sometimes I feel like a man   Stay here tonight   And let me hold you so tight   You are the one for me   You are my dreams, my reality.There's a smile on the faces I see   Since I found you   There's a laugh in the eye, where a tear used to be   Since I found you   There's a sound of a Memphis section playing on my radio   And it sings of the reasons why I love you so   Since I found you      There's a groove that's so smooth   I can hardly tell who's in the studio   And the girls on the street   Sing out of tune so sweet   I just have to go, it's all I need to know   Since I found you, I ain't never going to give you up   Since I found you, you keep me looking up   You keep me looking up   You keep me looking up   Turn it up.Uh, uh, uh   Oh babe what you do to me,   I can't help myself.Yeah, we're a boy band..You see right through me   And I can't hide   I'm naked   Around you   And it feels so right      I'm trying to remember   Why I was afraid   To be myself and let the   Covers fall away   I guess I never had someone like you   To help me, to help me fit   In my skin      I never felt like this before   I'm naked   Around you   Does it show?.On the blood of all our   Fathers -

"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community..Where's her nerve?.Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne, carved in jade..Get with this   I'll take you, boy   I'll make you, yeah      My fingertips   Against your lips   I'll move my hips      Come with me tonight   Alright, alright   I don't really wanna be pushy   But you got me feeling lovely tonight, tonight   I don't really wanna be pushy   But you got me feeling lovely tonight, tonight      You are my conscious   Forsake you, I won't   You are my conscious   Forsake you, I won't, I won't   You are my promise   Don't break me apart, ever, ever   I don't wanna be alone   So come with me tonight      Tongight, come with me, yeah      Undressing me   With your eyes and   Butterflies come and      Don't hesitate   Just do your thing   Baby, don't be lame      Come with me tonight   Alright, alright   I don't really wanna be pushy   But you got me feeling lovely tonight, tonight   I don't really wanna be pushy   But you got me feeling lovely tonight, tonight      You are my conscious   Forsake you, I won't, I won't   You are my promise   Don't break me apart, ever, ever   I don't wanna be alone   So come with me tonight.His mother had the frailty   You despise   And the looks   You love to drive to suicide   Not one wet eye around   Her lonely little grave   Said, ""He was out of line girl   You were not to blame."".Bet you can't guess how much I paid   That's a shame   Fuck these simple hoes tryna swerve in my lane      [Post-Hook]   Do it for the niggas   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Do it, do it, do it, do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Do it for the niggas   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Girl I ain't gon' do it   Nah I ain't gon' do it      [Bridge]   He said, ""Arch your back""   I ain't gon' do it   He said, ""Kiss my neck""   I ain't gon' do it   Talk dirty in my ear   I ain't gon' do it   Do it, do it, do it, do it   He said, ""Arch your back""   I ain't gon' do it   He said, ""Kiss my neck""   I ain't gon' do it   Talk dirty in my ear   I ain't gon' do it   I'ma need some fresh air, bitch      [Hook]   Gold in my champagne   Your shit blank, boy your shit lame   Probably just like your dick game   So I don't need to know your name   Don't you see these on my feet?.Lets pick up the pace..In the town they were going down   Tora!.Here we go now   Do it with the fever   Yeah, come on      Ain't no stoppin' us now   We're on the move   (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah)   Ain't no stoppin' us now   We've got the groove   (Spice Girls, check it out)      There've been so many things that have held us down   But now it looks like things are finally comin' around, yeah   I know we've got a long, long way to go, yeah   And were we'll end up, I don't know      But we won't let nothin' hold us back   We're gonna get ourselves together, ha   We're gon' polish up our act, yeah   And if you've ever been held down before   I know that you refuse to be held down any more, yeah-yeah      Don't you let nothin', nothin'   (Nothin' stand in your way, and all ago)   I want why'all to listen, listen   (That's right, to every word I say, every word I say about it)      Ain't no stoppin' us now (that's right)   We're on the move (you said it, we've got the groove)   Ain't no stoppin' us now   We've got the groove (ooh-oh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh)   Ain't no stoppin' us now   We're on the move (we've got the groove)   Ain't no stoppin' us now   We've got the groove (yeah, look let me tell you this)      I know you know someone who's got a negative vibe (who?).Dost ask who that may be?.Oh Klingel.....

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1's small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more conected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as uch as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one..You tell me that you're sad and lost your way   You tell me that your tears are here to stay   But I know you're only hiding   And I just wanna see you      You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain   And I can see your head is held in shame,   But I just wanna see you smile again   See you smile again      But don't burn out   Even if you scream and shout   It'll come back to you   And I'll be here for you      Oh I will carry you over   Fire and water for your love   And I will hold you closer   Hope your heart is strong enough   When the night is coming down on you   We will find a way through the dark      I wish that I could take you to the stars   I'd never let you fall and break your heart   And if you wanna cry or fall apart   I'll be there to hold you      You tell me that you hurt, it's all in vain   But I can see your heart can love again   And I remember you laughing   So let's just laugh again      But don't burn out   Even if you scream and shout   It'll come back to you, back to you      Oh I will carry you over   Fire and water for your love   And I will hold you closer   Hope your heart is strong enough   When the night is coming down on you   We will find a way through the dark      And you don't need   You don't need to worry   And you will see it's easy to be loved   I know you wanna be loved      Oh I will carry you over   Fire and water for your love      Oh I will carry you over   Fire and water for your love   And I will hold you closer   Hope your heart is strong enough   When the night is coming down on you   We will find a way through the dark      Oh I will carry you over   Fire and water for your love   And I will hold you closer   Hope your heart is strong enough   When the night is coming down   We will find a way through the dark.Chorus      So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight..[Hook]   Do you see, what I see   All I do, is want to be   Somebody, can you feel what I feel   I try my best, to keep it real   And pay dues   [Z-Ro]   Extra extra read all about it, I'm going crazy   Ro raging with motherfuckers smoking, going eighty   Miles per hour, pass up the city gel on my collar   Trying to locate and half of it, that will give a nigga some power   Not saying that I'm weak, bullets gon hang when I speak   I bust a brain if I reach, and get that thang off my seat   I'm in love with selling, that's why I ain't winning that much   Gas money looking funny, wheels ain't spinning that much   But I'ma make it the way of the other, cause I can't stop   People trying to trick me of my mission, but I can't drop   Cause I can't fall, run up I'ma keep bumping my lead   Before the game over I know, I'ma be dumping my lead   Because I'm nervous by nature, the slightest move will get you shot   I've been known to help niggas make it, to they burial plot   Not my lifestyle, I love the way the feddy stack   Record labels stealing Z-Ro, to CEO gon get it back   [Hook]   [Z-Ro]   Sometimes, I feel like doing myself   Sixty percent of my body is drank, I ruin myself   But I'm addicted, eyes fucked leaning and look inflicted   With my facing revelations, tripping on what it predicted   Cause it's happening, when the trumpet blow   Ain't gon be no mo' laughing and, it's to the left or the right   I hope I get to go to heaven, I hear heaven is tight   Plus they tell me that hell is hot, and they won't give you no ice   I need a cool wrist, most of these bitches be the devil trying to fool me   Taking my kindness for weakness, and trying to use me   Bitch fuck your hair and your nails, you bout to lose me   I sleep with my uzi, cause she ain't gon steal from me if I nod off   The only place I don't let her go, is in God house   I'm a gangsta fa sho, you better believe me   I bet I'll be on that doja, every time you see me   [Hook]   [Z-Ro]   I done made up my mind   Hustle all alone, I'm trying to get up some mo' shine   Every time I turn around, someone bringing me down   Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds   And now they thinking I'm a crazy   Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby, I want my mama   Cause I'm having bad dreams, and I die in em all   Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all   I live the thug life, heartless and hopeless   Laying low ducking the law, with long you lusting and acting douches   I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10   Until my out of town connect, put out your chest and took my ends   Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I take   Fears get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face   Feel me, I done lost my mind, but it's all gravy baby   I get tipped for knocking bustas off daily   [Hook -

"Due to an on going debattle about weither or not computers benefit society I am writing to you to inform you of my opinion on this mater. I believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back. I believe this because. First of all, computer bring about online communication. Also computers advance and enhance learning, had to mention that computers advance emloyment. As I mentioned, computers bring about online communications. Now after reading this there must be one side running thru your head define this well online communication, include social networkinjg sites litre facebook and twitter and not to forget my space. This also includes email and blogs and some chat sites. Okay enough of that But how do these things inventions iprove our lives. These inventions allow long distance communication bringing people ""closer together."" @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And thru facebook, my mother can speak with him any time she wishes and over from their relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 be very nessary @CAPS1 same. Also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication. Besides, I mentioned learinig. Computers can improve learning in a variety of ways. Computers improve learning because they speed the flow of information to the students can go to such places and a school websites to findout more on a particular occuring at the school. @CAPS1 example, I go on my school's website to retreve nightly homewrok assignments and read the next day's daily annocments. Teachers might post helpfel hints on homework and @MONTH1 a detailed explanation of the assignment. Also computers can improve learning by assiting with research projects @CAPS1 example a couple of weeks ago my health class was information car our illegal drug project. So with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it..Said yea jerk gonna put it in ya put it in ya!.Put the radio on,   Put the radio on, (Yes, yes)   I don't wanna know I'm wrong,   I don't wanna know I'm wrong..The world won't get no better   If we just let it be   The world won't get no better   We gotta change it yeah,   Just you and me..Glory!.Born and raised in the U.S.A   By the way of New Orleans where the Killas stay, OK   Uh alright, yeah   Born and raised in the U.S.A   Where the governments watching what you do and say   Ay well alright, yea      Well I'm a tell you this story bout a nigga wit' glory   Ya I come from piss poor and now I live in six stories houses   Now hows this   Listening to my own voice in my black Rolls Royce   Get the girls of my choice to take off their shorts and blouses   Ha ha take off my trousers, ya   Ya don't know nothing bout this!.Call me the dead body man (You can sell 'em to me!).It's not as if I'm not totally aware   That you want my hands right here and my mouth right there   Girl, don't play shy, show me how bold you can be   Open your mouth and tell me where you want me      [Chorus]      Tell me what you want   Oh, you want that?.Oh so sad a requiem..It's showtime   Hey, Patrick - hit the lights   There's something in the air   There's magic in the night   Now here's the band, they really play   I'll count the first one in   I don't know where it's gone   Well all know where it's been      [Chorus]      The last man standing   Step right up, he's the real thing   The last chance of a lifetime   Come see, hear, feel, the real thing..Eighteen!.But just in Africa,   It's long before the global surge..Coo coo cachou ca coo..Lord, Lord, Lord, sittin' down by my window,   Baby, lookin' out at the rain..And now is the time to decide   On a way to escape from the cavern   The old silver chains on the wall   Are now also trapping their souls   Airin my princess I can not endure all my pain   But I swear to you on my proud name...   You'll open the mystical gate!.[Verse:]   I snook out the front door into winter and the world outside   I stepped out the door to New York City, my hair was barely dry   I could not remember where I was going, so I went back inside   Nothin' happened in the elevator, nothing happening on the stairs   Nothing ever happenin' when I am sleeping and I cannot stay there   How'd you find a party when you're in your room?.I understand that you feel upset   What do you say that you forgive and forget?.You make me feel like I'm just givin' free love away      I can send flowers tomorrow   But it doesn't mean a thing   If your heart rejects the message from mine   It's a waste of time      Baby love knows I love you   Baby love knows the truth   Baby love knows the feeling that is in here   Resting in my heart   From the very start   I loved you   Resting in my heart   From the very start   I loved you      Yeah, I look at you and know I never loved anyone more   You make me feel like a child in a candy store   What can I do to prove   That you're a dream come true   And in this dream there's a pulse from my heart to you   I can send daisies daily   But it never will penetrate   If your heart if rejects the best from mine   It's a waste of time      Baby love knows I love you (I really do)   Baby love knows the truth   Baby love knows the feeling that is in here   Resting in my heart   From the very start   I loved you (I really do, babe)   Resting in my heart   From the very start   I loved you      Baby I'm lookin for cupid   Can I tie him in a ball and chain   To see if he can say to you   The words that make you feel my love is real, oh      Baby love knows I love you   (That's right you know I love you, baby girl)   Baby love knows the truth   (Hey gotta know the truth, you know I love you)   Baby love knows the feeling that is in here   Resting in my heart   (In my heart)   From the very start   I loved you   (Yeah, that's right)   Resting in my heart   From the very start   I loved you, yeah.I hope there's someone out there who could tell me   Why the man I love wanna leave me in so much pain..Where those winning women that's really willin to take it off!.You're going to get what you deserve..Run just as fast as I can,   To the middle of nowhere,   To the middle of my frustrated fears."
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 thingk that computers are helping our society, but I disagree. People who are sitting on the computer are not getting exercise or seeing beautiful nature. Do you want to get fat sitting next to a metal box? People are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important. People in your life. Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer. All of the cool, fit people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of the cool people and go outside and have yourself a ban looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals. You can do both of those with your friends and family while sitting on your computer you don't see them as much @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends and I bet you are one of them. Friends and family can also help you get through hard times without them whi knows wgere you would be in life. So do yourself a favor get off the computer, and go visit some really great people. Its now or neve to get off that computer or your family and friends are going to leave you and you are going to get fat on top of that. Do you want to be that person? You are also going to miss out on the beauty of nature. So go, go, go, have yourself some fun..Baby baby baby baby he's a screamin' the truth   America America is killing its youth..Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?.Can she sing a pretty song,   Billy Boy, Billy Boy?.He no longer thinks anything that moves   And everything he sees is something to kill and eat   what's troubling Gus?.?.I know that someday we'll find a way..Liza's had enough of men   She says, she won't get burned again   She says, they don't know how to fuck   Her last boyfriend, the shmuck   Shared with her a nice disease   Kept her passive, on her knees   'Til one day she took his car   And drove it to the city      Liza had put down a few   When she met this girl named Lou   Who convinced her to go home with her   She said ""My name's Louise   Now will you take your clothes off please?.Let the good times roll..We got to take this country back   Yeah, when we all gather up in Heaven   How we gonna face the man in black?.Do you deal in black money?.Those days of love are gone      Our time is through      Still I burn on and on      All of my life      Only for you         From now      Until forever      And ever my darling      Forever      You will always be the only one      You will always be the only one         As long as I shall live      I'll hold you dear      And I will reminisce      Of our love all through the years         From now      Until forever      And ever my darling      Forever      You will always be the only one      You will always be the only one         If you should ever need me      Unfailingly, I will return to your arms      And unburden your heart      And if you should remember      That we belong together      Never be ashamed      Call my name      Tell me I'm the one you treasure         Forever      And ever, my darling      Forever      You will always be the only one      You will always be the only one      You will always be the only one         Forever      You will always be the only one      Forever      You will always be the only one      Forever      You will always be the only one      Forever      You will always be the only one      Forever      You will always be the only one....W-What the fuck was that?.Boom, the homie came up and was like   ""Nigga say that shit in my motherfuckin' face""   Popped him dead in his motherfuckin' mouth nigga   Niggaz be talkin' all this

switches and get your frame fucked up   You gotta (say it to my face), I'm right here with a 12-gauge   You talkin' to a man that plan on dyin' of old age   Until that day, I crush everything in my way   And give a fuck about what y'all say      [Chorus]      Too much of anything makes you a addict   Wantin' contact with another man makes you a faggot   Patience is virtue, don't make me hurt you   I came full circle, about-face reversal   Salute the general, make yourself presentable   Analytical, every move made political   (Say it to my face) and wake up in a hospital   Huh, gutter never

"I would agree because computers do help people with other things like vacations sights, jobs, presents and shoping. So many uses for the computer. But creators of the computer are worried that people are spending to much time on the computer. Mainly its about conserners and users, most of those people complain that their having no time with their family and friends. You never know if the users are looking up vacation trips for both friends and familys. The things that conserners dont get is that the computer can teach you alot of things, history, mathmatics, science experiments and many more. Computers are also used in schools to help students with their work, even teachers use the computer for grades. It is true about people not going outside geting some fresh air or even taking a walk in the park. They cant keep themselfs on the computer for like @NUM1 hours, its just crazy. So i would go with both sides. Its just better to enjoy life then just look up things that you dont really need to. You should only need to go on like paying bills, and furneture for your house. Thats why the computer was invented..But the saddest thing I've ever seen,   Is a tear from a woman's eye..Final bow   In a disused music hall   Of laughter and mime   The airwave police   Were the only   Admirers to admire      Sliding sideways in a rusty old Ford   The drivers broke down and   A young girl screams   Walking through rock dreams   Tall stories   Mobile T.V..Six sets smoked on Saturdays   At Barnaby's on State   Countless California calls   We could not stand the wait   We played the pier on Venice beach   The crowd called out for more   Zappa and the Mothers next   We finished with a roar   Jimi was so kind to us   Had us on the tour   We got some education   Like we never got before   Around the world in twenty days   We played most every night   Jet-lag, girls, strange languages   Everyone began to fight   Lowdown at the Caribou   All rumours aside   Was we could never get together   Not unless we tried   Summer with the Beach Boys   We got sand all in our shoes   Made some special music   Everybody sang the blues.My words are lazy   My thoughts are hazy   But this is one thing I'm sure of   Everybody needs a best friend   I'm happy I'm yours      You got a double   Who brings you trouble   And though you're better without me   Everybody needs a best friend   I'm happy I'm yours      A fool could see decidedly   That you're a ten and I'm a three   A royal brie is what you need   So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me      Oh you got a... Full of dreadful   And yet lest that someone adores you   Everybody needs a best friend   I'm happy I'm yours      A fool could see decidedly   That you're a ten and I'm a three   A royal brie is what you need   So how did you come to be stuck with a bummer like me.All invisible from where we stand,   The connections come to pass   And though too strange to comprehend,   They affect us nonetheless,

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a world where the uneployment rate rises sinificgently, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just discapeared. I think computers are more benefical to society then some people relize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an acountend. Computer games and @CAPS2 help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teen how to become sucessful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now acess grades in a heartbeat. My computer helps me..Another main line ride   Oh no!.I hear every word they say   They tell me to stay away   They say I'm better off without you, baby   You've caused me nothing but pain

picked the morning paper off the floor   It was full of other people's little wars   Wouldn't they like their peace   Don't we get bored   And we call for the three great stimulants   Of the exhausted ones   Artifice, brutality and innocence   Artifice and innocence      No tanks have ever rumbled through these streets   and the drone of planes at night has never frightened me   I keep the hours and the company that I please   And we call for the three great stimulants   Of the exhausted ones   Artifice, brutality and innocence   Artifice and innocence      Oh and deep in the night   Our appetites find us   Release us and bind us   Deep in the night   While madmen sit up building bombs   And making laws and bars   They'd like to slam free choice behind us      I saw a little lawyer on the tube   He said, ""It's so easy now, anyone can sue."".Things are falling down on me   Heavy things I could not see   When I finally came around   Something small would pin me down   When I tried to step aside   I moved to where they hoped I'd be      Vanessa calls me on the phone   Reminding me I'm not alone   I fuss and quake and cavitate   I try to speak and turn to stone      Telly reaches through my vest   To do the thing that she does best   She probes and tears my ventricles   Steals my one remaining breath      Things are falling down on me   Heavy things I could not see   When I finally came around   Something small would pin me down   When I tried to step aside   I moved to where they hoped I'd be      Stumbling as I fall from grace   She needs my vision to replace   Her ailing sight throughout the night   Leaving two holes in my face      Mary was a friend I'd say   'Till one summer day   She borrowed everything I owned   And then simply ran away      Things are falling down on me   Heavy things I could not see   When I finally came around   Something small would pin me down   When I tried to step inside   I moved to where they hoped I'd be.I'll be your mirror   Reflect what you are, in case you don't know   I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset   The light on your door to show that you're home      When you think the night has seen your mind   That inside you're twisted and unkind   Let me stand to show that you are blind   Please put down your hands   'Cause I see you      I find it hard to believe you don't know   The beauty that you are   But if you don't let me be your eyes   A hand in your darkness, so you won't be afraid      When you think the night has seen your mind   That inside you're twisted and unkind   Let me stand to show that you are blind   Please put down your hands   'Cause I see you      I'll be your mirror.Time has washed away   And now I may wonder   How did it all slip by   Cause I always thought   We had forever   Future calls to me   To take me away from things   I don't want to leave behind   Like I'm slipping away   I can't hold on      Find that path alone   Crossroads lead me away   But that's not what worries me   I just want to know what's home      Through it all   My mind still wanders   To the one who touched my soul   Though her road leads away   She's still my   True love   I could believe      Will is not enough when all those   Lost days stand in the way   But she was   My hopes and dreams my   Whole world   I could believe      I still want to know   Who can see for me   Crossroads tell me      Now you'll have to trade   Your past away   And find another day   So is change a friend or an enemy      Through what comes to pass   I'll find my way   I've seen it all before   But is the best you can be   The best thing to be   Some people say   You're just wasting time   But that's not what worries me   I just want to know what's home.Genevieve, why did you

"Dear @CAPS1, The computers that are being used, do have a positive effect on people. For example, there's better communication with friends and family, you get instant news on any topic, and you get advanced education. Imagine if no important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries the person no contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a facebook, or other interacting werbsites, you know what's going on in your friends life all the time without having the to by reaching them all the to see how they are doing. Every adult watching the news at night before they go to bed to see what has @CAPS2, what if you went to bed early. How would you know what happened? That's when you would go online and check what you missed, you could've missed out on what happened in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, or missed out on the wars to the @LOCATION1, or even tragedies that happened right near you. Not only will you have better communication and the news at the top of your fingers, but you will also have advanced education.

sun dance to your drum   And now it's pandemonium!.Is there someway out of here?"
"The reason why I think computers are good is because people like to do their work, or children likes the games on the computers. The second reasons is that adults likes to do their jobs online. Finally people who have computers are probably happy because computers is a good thing to have because you can do everything on it. My opinion is that computers are good for people because you can do everything like play game, go on myspace, facebook, twiter and alot of other websites..Goin' home, my baby   Goin' home, my baby

"Dear Local Newspaper, I am awair that more people use computers everyday. I think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them. Computers gives information about the latest and most recient things that happen in other towns contries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn'@CAPS1 see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn'@CAPS1 find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldnt want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you correct with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That @MONTH1 not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friend close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people @MONTH1 dislike them but they have good reasons why. More family time can be but I think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising. Well my time is up here. Hope you liked what I said here and you'll have a passion for computers..She's quite a mediator   A smoother operator you will never see   Said see you later   You know one day I disobeyed her openly

"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would wont computors because it benifits our society. It helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on. For example if you wanted to no about it's sports, you can just type in name. Also a computer can help you with your education. If you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. It is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. It is also a good way to communicate with you friends. For example, facebook, @CAPS3, twitter, and email one all good sources of communication. Also it is good for if you have a xbox or a @NUM1 you need a computer you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. It's good to have computors in school. Is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. It is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it. I hope these one all good reason to have computer in our society, and it will benifit us in a number a differnt ways.In Hava-vana every Cubana shakes her bandana to the La Conga..So on this gray and melancholy day, I'll move to a Manhattan hotel..[Hook].Your than is jigg-a-lin' and causin' a stir..When a man is running from his boss   Who holds a gun that fires cost   And people die from being old   Or left alone because they're cold   And bombs are dropped on fighting cats   And children's dreams are run with rats   If you complain you disappear   Just like the lesbians and queers   No one can love without the grace   Of some unseen and distant face   And you get beaten up by blacks   Who though they worked still got the sack   And when your soul tells you to hide   Your very right to die's denied   And in the battle on the streets   You fight computers and receipts   And when a man is trying to change   It only causes further pain   You realize that all along   Something in us going wrong...

"More people tend to use computer's more than going outside enjoying the weather, and I think people should less time on the computer and more time interacting with whom ever. People spend most of their time talking to people on any websites/playing online games. I think that it's a bad habit, people of all ages spend their time doing that when they can do something fun, but chose not to. Parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous. There has been many people who have been hired. Raped in websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many other dangerous websites. In be more I would say that children and adults talk to strangers and think they know that personso well, meet them some place and get killed or anything because many people lie they age. And who know that person can be a fiftey year old woman or man. Say their a teen and end up finding you That is why parents should not be let their children be on period of time and should be on. While you reading this I hope you understand why it's rong and take my suggestion under and help us young kids to (thank you).Choose a side   And, here's your gun      Brought up   Knowing right from

"Over @PERCENT1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 owns at least one computer in their house. Computers benefit society because they help the earth, and are a fast way to spread important information. Also you can talk with friends and family on computers. We have been told that some people think were spending too much time on the computer. Yes, but we need these machines to survive. News @CAPS1 took a pull and said ""more than half of @LOCATION1 schools are now using computers to put homework on to save paper"". @CAPS3 we start useing computers to do things that we ushelly use paper for we would be saving millions of trees. For example you can send an email insted of snail mail, the mail would go faster and save paper! People who care about the earth make websites on the computer to inform people how to @CAPS2 just to see each otherthey could mail and talk all they want. Also @CAPS3 you like to use cellphone alot the waves kill apoximately @NUM1 bees a year. @CAPS3 you chatted with your freinds it would save bees lives. The first snow day we my parents forgot to check the schools website and I was out in snow @CAPS3 we didn't computers this would happen to every little students an snow @NUM2 @CAPS3 there was a storm and you. I'v went out the is another place you can check' to get the weather and keep your family safe. @CAPS3 there was a hurricane and the power like birthdays and weddings your computer has a calendar on it that tells you wherever you write something on it. @ORGANIZATION1 citizens spend over @MONEY1 a year on phone bills. You can talk to freinds and family on the computer and save thousands. When parents don't have phones they rely on computers to comunicate with people.

"Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or whatever you talk to your friends are. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be much interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but thats not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there, but then what would be the fun of that. For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, dont you feel great when your going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful I am thankful to god of giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, georgus. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else or even riding your @CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision but beacuse of the computer they got that wich really stinks. Now as you can you see computers really can change your life. So that's your discision.

"Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with..My breaking heart and i agree   That you and i could never ever be   So with my best, my very best, i set you free!.[Chorus].You're already falling the one that it's calling is you..He needs a mile of masking tape if he wants   To keep his ship in shape,   Someday to escape what his heart remembers,   Yes, what his heart remembers..I'm an Oddity..Caught in the crossfire..The keys to death and hell   The ailing kingdom doomed to fail   The bonds of sin and heart will break   The pilgrims course will take      Quelling the devils might   And ready for eternal fight   Aching limbs and fainting soul   Holy battles take their toll      Liberty and hope divine   Changing the water into wine   So to you we bid farewell   Kingdom of heaven to hell      [Chorus:]   Spirit holy life eternal   Raise me up take me home   Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset   Onward journey begun      To courage find and gracious will   Deliver good from ill   Clean the water clean our guilt   With us do what you will      Then will my judge appear   Bear no false angel that I hear   For only then I will confess   To my eternal hell      Now give us our holy sign   Changing the water into wine   So to you we bid farewell   Kingdom of heaven to hell      [Chorus]      Now give us our holy sign   Changing the water into wine   So to you we bid farewell   Kingdom of heaven to hell      [Chorus].fly high over the see   There's a little girl who's waiting for me   Love her till my dying day   And when I die you'll hear me say   I love that girl for eternity   But I gotta get the first plane home   I gotta get the first plane home   Got to wing wing[?].(Lea)   I've been thinking   It seems we're going nowhere   You don't share my feelings   It doesn't seem fair   I guess there's nothing   Much more I can do   I know I've got to try   And make it without you   I don't love you anymore   Can't you see, it's just no good   I've gotta walk out that door   There's nothing left to say   I've gotta go my way   Try and understand   (Ariel)   We've had bad times   But that's no reason to go   I can't live without you   I need you, don't you know   That I still love you   Don't, don't do this to me   You know I won't make it alone   Can't you see   (L) I don't love you anymore   (A) Don't do this to me   (L) Can't you see it's just no good   I've gotta walk out that door   (A) That's no reason to go   (L) There's nothing left to say   (A) I can't live without you   (L) I 've gotta go my way   (A) Oh no...

"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 that humanity has, has it's up and down's and it's positives and negatives. the something with technology. It has it's ups's and downs but because of it our society grows increasingly advanced. It gives us the oppertunity to grow more sophisticated to set our goals beyond reach.

"Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it..Not me   Turned to the max, no sleep   Smoked a hundred joints to the face give a fuck what a bitch nigga say      E'rything about me ('bout me)   E'rything about me ('bout me)   E'rything about me, E'rything about me

that's all you get for today   It's easy, so easy, to tell you it's gon' be okay   When I don't walk shoes, haven't been through what you been through   Instead I push you away   Sunday everyone looks like you   But if our lives are cold inside tell me what's the use      If I say I love Jesus, but you can't see my Jesus   My words are empty, if they can't see Jesus in me   No more excuses, I give myself away   Because I may be the only Jesus they see      Too busy, forgive me, I've got problems of my own   It's easier to say your help is on the way   But I was your help all along   We're

"When people think about computers the first thing they think of is games. Thats not all they are good for. For most people they are very usefull. Computers are great for @ORGANIZATION1. At @ORGANIZATION1 they help with homework and projects. When we are assigned a project we need to do research on a topic and the fastest and easier way is by computer. The students at @ORGANIZATION2, especially @NUM1 graded, are able to type up easys because it's faster and alot easier. If we are at home and we forgot our homework we could look it up online. This can be really helpful and convient to students and teachers. Sometimes it's not @ORGANIZATION1 but its finding things. Technology and computers have came a long way. Now we can look up directions to places we dont or cant find. People can also finding names, numbers, or address useing websites like yellow pages can be a relieable resource for that. Say your going for vaction and your try to find somewhere to stay it could be tough but there are websites you can go on were if you want something fast or mabye a nice hotel for a low price you can find it. The computer can be very fan and intersting when you go places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and you want to show picture of the great time you had so you can post them online. Say you havent talked to and old friend in a while, you can look for them on @CAPS3 or another website and start talking agian you can also play games and connect with friends or play games with friends while online. Weather its @ORGANIZATION1, finding things, or connecting with frends the computer has what ever you need. Maybe it will at one point get damged but they have people who can fix it. Plus if you think about it computers have very reliable resourses that are more updated then books..Get high motherfuckers   Ready to Die motherfuckers   Hah!!.Things get bad, times get tough   Everybody knows   You gotta be a little stronger   Just to have the things you need   Everybody knows   If you try a little harder   You're gonna live a whole lot longer      Had enough of burnin' up the midnight hour   Going out and stayin' far too long      [Chorus:]   You got to believe in something   When you believe in something   These are the best of times   You got to have faith in someone   When you have faith in someone   These are the best of times      Don't give up, can't give in   Never lose a minute   It's a long hard road back from nowhere   Love is not what you take out   It's what you put back in it   Take you chance, there's no doubt   Everything will all work out      See my way, I know where I'm goin'   I know I'd never think that I'd ever give up   I want it all as soon as I can   Right where I am      Chorus.It's coming from so far away   It's hard to say for sure   Whether what I hear is music or the wind   Through an open door   There's a fire high in the empty sky   Where the sound meets the shore   There's a long distance loneliness   Rolling out over the desert floor      And the years that I spent lost in the mystery   Fall away leaving only the sound of the drum   Like a part of me   It speaks to the heart of me   Forget what life used to be   You are what you choose to be   It's whatever it is you see   That life will become      Whatever it is you might think you have   You have nothing to lose   Through every dead and living thing   Time runs like a fuse   And the fuse is burning   And the earth is turning      Though the years give way to uncertainty   And the fear of living for nothing strangles the will   There's a part of me   That speaks to the heart of me   Though sometimes it's hard to see   It's never far from me   Alive in eternity   That nothing can kill      Oh Lord   Are there really people starving still?.People livin' like they ain't got no mamas..And he said I thank the Lord that I took Him   at His word..I

the conversation:   Judge and jury in my head   It's coloring everything   All we did and said   And still I head that sharp tongue talking   Talking tangled words   I can sense the danger   Just listen to the wind      I want you close I want you near   I can't help but listen   But I don't want to hear   Hear that voice again      I want to be with you   I want to be clear   But each time I

"Computers can affect people in many ways. Most people use computers too much and it can affect their health and the peole around them. People need to get out side and get more active. America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time. Familys are constantly having problems about family members who never have time to talk and funch holes in walls for losing a video game. Dr. @PERSON1 or ""The studies of the human mind"" says ""I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people."" That goes to show it can cause problems in familys everywhere because of a video game! So please make sure you try to spend time with your family. So that shows that the computer can be fun, but also dangerous..Let's go see dad   Same time in the same spot   Corner of the same old parking lot   Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad   We

"Hi my name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing to the local news paper to say that computers are good for people and helps alot like how to get one place two another, how to learn about black history or famous people that did something to the world, and how to find out the news and weather from home or at work, how to keep your besnness going without computers their jobs would be hopless, and like of your family or you tyring to make it in life and the only way to get in contact would be the computers there are computers every where even doctors use them at a hospital to keep people alive to see what wrong with them and where they came from, and one more jobs need computers to, to see if the person is capable for the job so they might look for background information with out it even you would not have a good job so hee are some resons why computers are important. One of them is we need computers for so that we can get around, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers.

"Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion I support the advances in technology. Advances in technology helps us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is because computers/phones can help us get information on things we need to get information on. We need to know what is going on around us, all the time. We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives. We need to know the weather/traffic conditions if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co-worker sent you anything important that you need to know about. The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online. We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer. Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy, even though we can't see them in person. I, for one, knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online. Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong. The last reason why I support advances in technology is because computers can help us with our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. Computers can help our reading skills because if we don't have time to go to the bookstore to get a book, we can read the book online for free. It can help our hand-eye coordination because it can help our fingers move faster and help us do things faster. I stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends / family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills..Good God, if your song leaves our lips   If your work leaves our hands   Then we will be wonderers and vagabonds   They will stare and say how empty we are   How the freedom we had turned us up as dead men      Let us be cold, make us weak   Let us, because we all have ears   Let us, because we all have eyes   How they knew that this would happen   We're so run down   Good God!.Fightin', killin',   Wine and women gonna put me to my grave..One more time   Let's remember how good it felt   One more time   Remember what we meant   One more time   Can't help wondering where it went   One more time   Just one more time      I wonder if you finished   Workin' on that book   Maybe I could come 'round sometime   'n take a look   A friend of mine told me   That you've changed your hair   They say you're really different now   I remember how you were   I've still got your picture   I'm sure you know   We had something special   Where did it go?.You better be good tonight      You better watch out   You better not cry   You better not pout   I'm telling you why   Santa Claus is coming to town.Wake up, mow the weed   You'd be nothing without me   Take my life if you have the heart to die      You bastards tainted my tool   Raped my words, played me a fool   Gather your precious glitter and leave me be   The Great Ones are all dead   And I'm tired, too      I truly hate you all!.There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away   With a warm heart, whose better days are o'er   Though her voice should be merry, It's sighing all the day   Oh, hard times, come again no more..[Chorus]      There is another side to this pure land,   A side of blood and guilt and pain   A side of enemy and friend   And sorrow at the hearth side stain..At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes..I'm a believer,   I couldn't leave her if I tried,      [Verse 2:]      I thought love was more or less a given thing,   Seems the more you give,   The less I got,   Whats the use in trying, (Baddabudumbadum)   All you get is pain, (Baddabudumbadum)   When I needed sunshine I got rain,      [Chorus:].Boy, Boy, Crazy Boy   Stay Loose, Boy   Breeze It   Buzz It   Easy Does It   Turn Off The Juice, Boy      Just Play It Cool, Boy   Real Cool.The numbing dreams never end the swallow's wings still amongst   The idle wind   My colored world turns to grayscale   Recollecting the memories eyes covered hazel   Contradiction of thy thoughts standing calm love not lost   Searching till I find my princess whose passionate eyes cut right through me   For what is life if love only exists in thy thoughts?.[Verse 1]   We're leaving together   But still it's farewell   And maybe we'll come back   To earth, who can tell?.So I journeyed to her crib   And I let myself inside   That chick was slouched down on the couch   I think her brain was fried      Couldn't figure it out   She wouldn't even look at me   Then I saw her eyes, she was hypnotized   Cold glued to her TV      ""Hey, what's your problem baby doll   Let's have a little fling""   She said, ""Hey you fool, now just be cool   I'm watchin' that Gilligan's Isle thing""      Isle thing   Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing      Watchin' all night   Musta, been a marathon   I was bummin', those shows kept comin'   Here's what was goin' on      These castaways were stranded   On this island out at sea   One of them called Gilligan   So let's name him after m      He'd mess up every rescue   Man, that first mate was illin'   If I was one of those castaways   I think I'd probably kill 'I'm      Just about that time   Telephone began to ring   She said, ""Just let it, my machine'll get   We're watchin' the Gilligan's Isle thing      Isle thing   She loves that Gilligan's Isle thing   Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing   Please, baby, baby, please      I like the professor   He always saves their butts   He could build a nuclear reactor   From a couple of coconuts      She said, ""That guy's a genius""   I shook my head and laughed   I said, ""If he's so fly, they tell me why   He couldn't build a lousy raft""      And while we're on the subject   I'll tell you one thing for sure   Those homeboys brought an awful lot   For just a three hour tour      Then her mom came in the room   It was kind of embarrassing   She said, ""Hey you two, I was once like you   And I loved that Gilligan's Isle thing""      Isle thing   She'd watch that Gilligan's Isle thing   Please, baby, baby, please      Skipper's in a hammock   He's looking kinda fat   He'd throw a fit and then he'd hit   Old Gilligan with his hat      Mrs. Hal had it goin' on   But Mr. Hal was meaner   Ginger and Mary Anne could've used   Some funky cold medina (?).Come along let's park (let's park)   Can't you see what's going on

blow   Every now and then, I think of you      Every now and then when a girl walks by   And holds her head like you held yours high   Every now and then, I think of you      And once in awhile when the sun sets right   And the full moon glides like a diamond in the night   Every now and then, I think of you      And I remember you and I   In a soft golden light   Nothing like here and tonight   I won't hear about anyone's life but our own   And all that I have is hope   Baby you never know      Every now and then when a friend says, ""Hi""   And asks about us I just want to die   Every now and then, I think of you      I want to say everything's just fine   But only a fool could believe that line   Still every now and then, I think of you.Ooh!.One like the earth and the sky!!.(In your

"Dear local news, @CAPS2 more and more people use computers people ask if computers actually benifit society. In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, acess to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society here in why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite @CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like @CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the @CAPS1 were @CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather. Instead or local news imidiatly acess it on you @CAPS4 you can acess encyclopedia and distionarys like at the websites @CAPS5 provide an easy imidiats fools for daily uses. One least example towards the of computers Their are many websites that you can. One of @CAPS5 websites is called , @CAPS6 lets you upload picture of pople or family events for people in you @MONTH1 video chat with people over a and see the other persons face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends but with websites like @CAPS6 it is actually adding time. In conclution, @CAPS5 reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society, They provide entertainment, easy acess to and have many websites for social interactions, @CAPS7 society would be alot harder and this is why I think computers benifit society. .Because I had rhythm, music, love,   The sun, the stars and the moon above,   Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea..Well my pad is

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 have many debated on whether computers are good or bad. @CAPS6, I believe that computers aren't as good as many people think. Ever since computers were invented people haven't been exercising. Also less kids are reading. Lastly computers are taking away family time. When was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport? If you haven't it's probably because they are inside with their eyes glued to a computer screen. Exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit. More kids are becoming over weight everyday. Computer are just another reason why. I had a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer. She became very lazy. She never wanted to exercise or doing anything active. Little by little she started gaining weight. This is happening all around the world and it need to @CAPS4! What's your reading level? @CAPS3 are students in @NUM1 grade with a @NUM2 grade reading level. Part of the reason is because they rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book. Schools now do program called @CAPS5 @NUM3. This program is designed to help students improve their reading levels. I believe that if students would turn off the computers long enough and @CAPS5 we wouldn't need this program. My mom makes sure I @CAPS5 for at least @NUM4 mins everyday. Every student do the same. I remember a saying ""family time is golden time"" @CAPS6, now a days no one spends time with their family. Once again computers have played a part in this too. It's not just kids who have droped family time for computer time. It's adults too. I think the last time I spent some time with my family was about @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit. After that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens. In conclusion, the computers.Mama, mama move up, party move back   Shuffle to the left, wobble to the right   Now it's plain to see you're a heading for me   But it's a natural fact, huh, I like that

"Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' schoolworks. Finally, you are able to talk with other people on-line. These are just a few points why computers are very importent, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind becasue you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convinient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in-laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, now-a-days they even have on-line tutors and on-line colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With videochat, chatrooms, facebook and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even on-line dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after mu uncle divoriced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those on-line dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way. In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic inevntion because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home. recieve help with your schoolwork, and talk with other people on-line. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1.

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I rencently started researching the effects that computers have on people an have found some shocking facts. I do not belive computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future. My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fine, and thosands of creatures. With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities. Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead you can just @CAPS2 or email them and @CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person! In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers! Thank you for your time and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter. .'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty   When she's shining in the port   And the harbor clings to the jetty   For protection and support   Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play   You're all washed up when Poseidon has his day..How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea?.Take me out of the straits, I'm in   Come and stay here by my side   Somebody I can rely on   I broke the law, I've been set free   Give me something to decide upon   Come and show yourself to me   Is there someone sewing seams?.Yet in the dark streets shineth,   The everlasting light,   The hopes and fears of all the years,   Are met in thee tonight..I'm only the underline of the Word..[Chorus]   Star   You're a star   Yeah be careful   What   You're wishing for   All your dreams   Coming true   Star yes you are   You're now bigger   Than Venus and Mars   You can run   But you can't hide      So   You're gonna make it   Chance   You're gonna take it   Tinseltown   Is calling your name   Penny in your pocket   Walking like a prophet   Fortune teller   Claiming your fame      Arriving in style   On the   Red carpet mile   To the left   To the right   Step aside   As you wave   To the crowd   A voice   Cries out loud   Look at you   You're the new   Overnight sensation      [Chorus]      Love and hate   Related   Privacy invaded   A paparazzi   Public domain   Dirty little secret   Guess   She couldn't keep it   At least you made it   On the front page      A tabloid be told   All that glitters   Ain't gold   Not a muse   Drug abuse suicide   As you're left   All alone   After   Selling your soul   In the aisle, smile   Ready   For your close up      [Chorus]      Stars in your eyes   Got   Your piece of the pie   In the sky   Don't look down   As you hang on      [Chorus]      Stars in your eyes   Got   Your piece of the pie   In the sky   Don't look down   As you're hanging on      Hanging on   For your life   For you're better off   Dead then alive   Then they love you   Forever.Woh yeah!!.Just ask the girl that I knew somewhere..What do you mean we don't communicate?.Stand up and fight..We shall live again, we shall live again..Every little things a lesson,   Number one, hold the sun..And you see me fly away without you..The ride with you was worth the fall my friend   Loving you makes life worth living      Didn't we almost have it all   The night we held on till the morning   You know you'll never love that way again   Didn't we almost have it all.Fear of death the dark inside   Have become your only children   They're in front of you, watching you   Lost screams unholy dreams unrest      I laugh at your god as he's passing through   Slicing at your throat to warm my skin   Never thought it'd come to this   Fuck I've gone wrong no rest      Your children still call   Can't you hear them screaming out your name?.Is there really just,   One chance   At a true love   If a heart breaks,   Does it break forever?.Light and bright and right somehow..Keep an eye on summer this year   Keep an eye on summer   Keep an eye on      We said goodbye last September   Your words I still can hear   Keep an eye on summer this ahh haaa ahhhh (summer)   (keep an eye on)   Those things I say in my letters   You'll find them most sincere   Keep an eye on summer this year-ear-ear      Soon we'll be graduating   And we'll be so far apart   And though you could be dating   I'm waiting and waiting      And as we look at the future   Though it be through a tear   Keep an eye on summer this (year)ahh haaa ahhhh   (keep an eye on summer)   (keep an eye on)   Ahhh haaaa ahhhh   (keep an eye on summer)   (keep an eye on)   Ahhh haaaa ahhhh   (keep an eye on summer)   (keep an eye on)   Ahhh haaaa ahhhh.Little Boy kneels at the foot of the bed,   Droops on the little hands little gold head..You only want revenge   It's been said   I'd be dead   If looks could kill      Where'd you go   With that threadbare crowd   Still in tow?.The captain waits above the celebration   Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid   Whose ebony face is beyond communication."

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am aware that many people are stateing that people spend too much time on computers and not getting enuff exercise well I have that their are a lot of people useing computers and they are gettiing enuff use. Im going to explane why within the most few paragraphs. First I would like to start off by saying its good that people are into computers and working with them because that books their learning activities and they learn new thinngs and it will help them be sucessfull in life, people play games, cross word puzzles, riddles, and many more. Same use the internet for ingredence, car parts, ect. Next, useing computers is very helpful to the human race because it will effect students school, parents/guardians/teens. It will effect and lots of schools are useing computers now and exspecialy students to do their. It effects parents, beca use it will sucess them in life and help them find jobs, with their jobs. Finally their getting enuff exercise because their going to bed, their eating, they go to school, work, or do something for the day that involves walking. Nobody just sits home and does nothing those days. Theirs always something to do or a place to go. Well I hope you think about what I told you and take it into consideration. Thank you for your time, and just remember your job is done on computer too..I'm not a rat to be spat on locked up in this room   Those bars that look towards the sun at night look towards the moon   Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love   Make me wish that I had wings take me high above      And I looked high and saw the empty sky   If I could only, I could only fly   I'd drift with them in endless space   But no man flies from this place      At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars   The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far   If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above   I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love      Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck   Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet   That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land   By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man      And I looked high and saw the empty sky   If I could only, I could only fly   I'd drift with them in endless space   But no man flies from this place      Just send up my love ain't seen nothing but tears   Now I've got myself in this room for years   I don't see no one, I never see anyone.I think it was his eye..You're the biggest fake..I hoarsely cry   Oh...

"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society..All the colours of the world should be   Lovin' each other wholeheartedly   Yes, it's all right   Take my message to your brother   And tell him twice      Spread the word and try to teach the man   Who's hating his brother   When hate won't do, ooh   'Cause we're all the same, yes   The blood inside of me is inside of you      Now, tell me   Can you feel it?.Oh, oh, oh   Sitting here with nothin' to do   Sitting here thinkin' only of you   But you'll never get out of there   She'll never get out of there..My heart ain't in it, but I'll hold the door..I skimmed across black water, without once submerging   Onto the banks of an urban morning   That hungers the first light, much much more   Than mountains ever do      And she like a ghost beside me goes down with the ease   of a dolphin   And emerges unlearned, unshamed, unharmed   For she is the perfect creature, natural in every   feature   And I am the geek with the alchemists stone      For all of you who must discover, for all who seek to   understand   For having left the path of others, you find a very   special hand      And it is a holy thing, and it is a precious time   And it is the only way      Forget-me-nots among the snow, it's always been and so   it goes   To ponder his death and his life eternally      For all of you who must discover   for all who seek to understand   For having left the path of others, you find a very   special hand      And it is a holy thing, and it is a precious time   And it is the only way   Forget-me-nots among the snow, it's always been and so   it goes   To ponder his death and his life eternally      One bright blue rose outlives all those   Two thousand years and still it goes   To ponder his death and his life eternally.Touch my mouth with your hands...

"Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!.Mister blue sky please tell us why   You had to hide away for so long, so long   Where did we go wrong?.I just wanna walk you home..They'll have a big glass of alcohol      'Cause I'm an actress through and through   And to my bones   And if I make it to the top I won't be overthrown   I'm an actress ah, yeah, yeah.I made a mistake, yes, I did, yes, I did   Made a mistake, yes, I did, yes, I did   Now I'm so far from her, but it was me and my fate   Who lost because of my mistake      My trusting her has gone much too late   I've sent away the girl I love   I said, I've sent away the girl I love   She well gone, people crying      Said, my bold heart been dying   Who is it who made that mistake?.I never can say goodbye..There's no place for me without you      Never let me go   I'd be so lost if you went away   There'd be a thousand hours in a day without you   I know      Because of one caress my world was overturned   at the very start   All my bridges burned by my flaming heart   You'd never leave me would you?.You should know by now   This much is true   My love is here for you      Time, nothing but time   To make up your mind   I'll give you all that you need   I want you to know   I'll never let go   'Til you come back to me      Even though you're far away   I'm right beside you day by day      Chorus:   Don't you know my love is here?.And girl you might as well just say what you're already thinking   Cause we on the same page   Take me to ecstasy and far beyond   Show me how you're hella fun, baby [?].Just put another record on.Am I still not worth that much?.Come back and give me a chance to explain   Your baby will never cry again..I heard someone call your name   Underneath my willow   I saw something tucked in shame   Underneath your pillow      Well I tried so hard, baby   But I just can't see   What a woman like you   Is doing with me      So tell me who I see   When I look into your eyes   Is that you, baby   Or just a brilliant disguise?.Gonna have a good time tonight..I can't want it anymore      Something has changed within me   Something is not the same   I'm through with playing by   The rules of someone else's game   Too late for second-guessing   Too late to go back to sleep   It's time to trust my instincts   Close my eyes   And leap      It's time to try defying gravity   I think I'll try defying gravity   And you can't pull me down      Can't I make you understand   You're having delusions of grandeur?.Making friends for the world to see   Let the people know you got what you need   With a friend at hand you will see the light   If your friends are there, then everything's all right      It seems to me a crime that we should age   These fragile times should never slip us by   A time you never can or shall erase   As friends together watch their childhood fly.She's nice if you ask her twice..Softly, softly in the night   Why, you can guess the rest...

"Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to..Oh oh oh   Whatcha gonna tell your father?.Harry Braff..Bungalow   Bungalow   By the sea      Bungalow   In the sea air   Climbing rose   Time to spare      Luxury accommodation traps the sun   So we're working every hour that God made   So we can fly away   Saving it all up for you      Bungalow      Bungalow   Silver shore line   In the gorse   You can be mine      Standing prime position for the town   Working for this vision through our lives   So we can fly away   Saving it all up for you      Bungalow   Bungalow   You wait and see.Neil is so mellow and laid back..Want you like I've never wanted anyone,   Got a face like God and a bod' like John..Well, I wish I was on some   Australian mountain range..Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue..You can take a taco to Katama too..I need love, love   Oh, ease my mind   And I need to find time   Someone to call mine      My mama said, ""You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait""   She said, ""Love don't come easy   But it's a game of give and take""      You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait   Just trust in a good time   No matter how long it takes      How many heartaches must I stand   Before I find the love to let me live again   Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on   When I feel my strength, oh, it's almost gone      I remember mama said, ""You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait""   She said, ""Love don't come easy   It's a game of give and take""      How long must I wait   How much more must I take   Before loneliness   Will cause my heart, heart to break      No, I can't bear to live my life alone   I grow impatient for a love to call my own   But when I feel that I, I can't go on   Well, these precious words keep me hanging on      I remember mama said, ""You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait""   She said, ""Love don't come easy   Well, it's a game of give and take""      You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait   Just trust in a good time   No matter how long it takes, now break      Now love, love don't come easy   But I keep on waiting   Anticipating for that soft voice   To talk to me at night   For some tender arms   Hold me tight   I keep waiting   Oh, till that day   But it ain't easy   (Love don't come easy)   No, you know it ain't easy      My mama said, ""You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait""   She said, ""Love don't come easy   But it's a game of give and take""      You can't hurry love   No, you'll just have to wait   She said, ""Love don't come easy   It's a game of give and take"".Mud slide slim and the blue horizon   Oh, mud slide, i'm dependent on you   I don't know but i've been told   There's a time from time to time   I can't eat, i can't sleep   But i just might move my feet   'cause there's nothing like   The sound of sweet soul music   To change a young lady's mind   And there's nothing like a   Walk on down by the bayou   To leave the world behind   Mud slide i'm depending upon you   Mister mud slide slim and the blue horizon      I've been letting the time go by   Letting the time go by   Yes, i'm letting the time go by   Letting the time go by      I'm gonna cash in my hand and   Pick up on a piece of land   And build myself a cabin back in the woods   Lord, it's there i'm gonna stay   Until there comes a day   When this old world starts to changing for the good   Now the reason i'm smiling is over on a island   On a hillside in the woods where i belong   I want to thank jimmy, jimmy, john, nick and laurie   The no jets construction for setting   Me down a homestead on the farm      Mud slide, i'm depending upon you   Mister mud slide slim and the blue horizon.Do you know who I am   Do you understand?.Baby, you wouldn't understand if I told you..We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle   Yo motherfucking hoes   He fucked the fleas off a bitch   He shacked the ticks off his dick   And in the booty, he buries his motherfucking bone   And if there's any left over   He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home      Damn, that Tanqueray is talking to a nigga   I ain't bullshitting, one of y'all niggas gotta get it   Man I got ta piss   Breath test?.In fact it couldn't be nice   A nice Jewish girl and a bottle of cider   Seven days later I was a man of the world   .......And when even the mem'ries have all faded away,   these days go on and on..It's our mistakes, take heed the Sabbath Stones      What life that takes what future did we earn?.I wasn't there to clean the cuts   I want the one who got caught in the ruts   I was just thinking maybe if you got no plans   I....Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red   She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead..This thing we got -

"@PERCENT1 of all people in the @LOCATION3 have computers. This number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer. It help us communicate better get imformation quicker and entertain us. Computer have a very positive effect on us. With the invention of the computer, more and more people can communicate quicker and eaisier. For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, @CAPS1 you have relatives who live across the country, you could use webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world. You can learn alot more about other countries culture and other cities way of life. Finally, @CAPS1 a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, the relationship just gets better. The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet you can findout how tall a maple tree is or , how to lose weight. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities nature walks and new and exciting excersises. When students need information on a school project, they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it. When the computer came, people could plaly games, watch @CAPS2.V. and movies, and do business. @CAPS1 you missed you favorite @CAPS2.V. Show you can go online and watch them. @CAPS1 you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, e-mail comes into place, and you mail will never be slow. And finally, you can play many, many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination. With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. Theres information quicker, communication better, and entertainment better. All of the search were in a very good world..Let It Snow!.Well it looks like it's another Skynyrd Family Christmas time   Seems like it was just New Years day   Started out in old L.A.

guess I must have gone astray   'Cause I'm drinking here and wishing for to die   I've got my wife, the other women   And the whiskey killing me   The first two make it so that I see red   The third one makes it so that I can't see   If I had half a brain left after my debauchery   I'd give up the other women and the W-I-F-E   It's just like my little sister told me   (Dear old momma)   In the end, you reap what you sow   I've been sowing seeds from Mexico to Tennessee   And I'm reaping now an awful lot of woe   I've got my wife, the other women   And the whiskey killing me   The first two make it so that I see red   The third one makes it so that I can't see   If I had half a brain left after my debauchery   I'd give up the other women and the W-I-F-E   I'd give up the other women and

to buy   To keep her warm from the oncoming storm      Well I found them in the northwest corner of the attic in a box   Labeled tinsel and lights   Didn't know what I was I looking for   Maybe just a blanket or artifacts   Eisenhower sent him to war   He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart   And when he hit shore   Must have been a target for the gunman      There were stars in the sky   There were bunkers on the hill and there were caskets to fill   Where he will lie   Shrouded in the red white and blue with the stripes      There were stars in the sky   There were houses on the hill   And there were bottles of pills that were easy to buy   To keep her warm from the oncoming storm.I hold you, I touch you   Make you my woman   I'll give you my love   With sweet

tomorrow, there'll be no tomorrow   The beginning of sorrow, beginning of sorrow   There will be no tomorrow.[Verse 1]   Driving quick past [?].Some of them are deadly."
"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you want people to be so memorized by a computer that they miss out in the world around them? @CAPS1 you want the kids in @LOCATION1 to spend hours each day on the computers playing games while they could be outside getting fresh air? The question then is, @CAPS1 computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is bad effect. People constantly use the computers teach them bad habbits and can search inappropriate things. IF people are always playing games the computers then when @CAPS1 they go out for a jag. The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in @LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""@CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, you know it you've wasted the wrote day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really and you don't to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get air. As you can computer can mesmorised a lot so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on bad habbits. For example, kids are always. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people dont use the. Too much and get too used writing like that. Then, kids @MONTH1 start doing that on writing in school and most even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to. learn your. Lastly is very easy for people, even to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words ad pictures and no one would ever know. people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to no easy to inappiopriate things. So go and limit the time you on computer..Is this all real?.Is there anyone home?.Looking around here you'd think   Sure, she's got everything      I've got gadgets and gizmos a plenty   I've got who's, it's, and what's it's galore   You want a Thing-A-Mabobs?.Sometimes I'm in the mood, Lord, I had my overflowin' fill   Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna make out my final will   Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna head for the walkin' hill   But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said   Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you..You'll never see a sign hanging on the wall   Sayin 'Smoking and drinking will be thy downfall'..They've got, they've got, so many very things to say about me   I'm telling you: lie   They, and they, and they will have so many things   They'll have so many things to say about you... to say about you   'cause they don't know me, know me   They don't know me, oh they don't know me, oh they don't know me   Oh they don't know me well   They, they, they, they, they, they, they don't know my Father   'cause if they did, if they did... hey ey... theeey... heh...I'm gonna show it   Yes I'm gonna make it mine   It's mine   Yes I will make it all mine.As a coma steals my name   Coma..Left New York this morning early   Traveling south so wide and high   Sailing through the wide blue yonder   It's that air mail special on the fly      Listen to the motors humming   She is streaking through the sky   Like a bird that's flying homeward   It's that air mail special on the fly      Over plains and high dark mountains   Over rivers deep and wide   Carrying mail to California   It's that air mail special on the fly      Watch her circle for the landing   Hear her moan and cough and sigh   Now she's coming down the runway   It's that air mail special on the fly.And He shall reign forever and ever   More....I lost some hours thinking of it   I need the strength to go and get what I want   I lost a lifetime thinking of it   An' lost an era daydreaming like I do      You can lose some hours thinking of it   You need the strength to go and get what I want   You can lose a lifetime thinking of it   And lose an era daydreaming like I do.It seems easier for us   If I don't show all of myself..No the heart never forgets..She don't care, 'bout education,   Money is, her motivation,   He don't live, but love and passion,   When he can buy, his satisfaction..Okay..Lingerin' taste of toothpaste   Made the milk go down a bit funny..Let's get it on!.I want to give you happiness   Just like the sun gives to the day   I'd like to make you mine, yeah   I'm gonna make you mine   Just like a blinding dream   Yeah, you're gonna be with me..Your axe belongs to a dying nation,   They don't know that we own you..Lindana: I'm not Veronica or Allison or Donna!.I think I'll go it alone, you should've shown me if you cared   Lies will turn a heart into stone, few would have known me if they dared      'Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began   The house on the cape, the place on the sand   I'd take it all back if it'd just make you understand      Girl how I've tried to forget you, now it would take more than I could buy   Sure I could lie to myself too, but that won't work seeing that I've tried      'Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began   I'd live in a shack eating out of a can   I'd take it all back if it'd just make you understand      Now that I'm feeling assured, you'd better watch your every move   Stop, think about every word, it's looking like you're going to lose      'Cause I'm takin' it back where it all began   The house on the cape, the place on the sand   I'd take it all back if it'd just make you understand      You should've shown me if you cared"
"Yes, I believe that computers benefits society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn and lastly compoters are apart of todays technology. First of all, computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have. Computers have helped todays life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didnt know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likley you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where its located or anything else abot it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say your going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the adress and the internet will give you directions. Even if you dont know when your favorite to show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefits society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well, because one of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about christmas i found her on facebook and now we talk and catch up because we havent seen each other in years, @CAPS2 alone tak to her. Another reason why is that if someones mon or dad is away at war or oversea's then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, skype, yahoo instant messenger, with the webcam or the telephone just @CAPS2 alone just typing back and fourth. You could also just use it for a job buisness to talk to your co-worker or one of your workers on webcam to see things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technollogy has come a long way. For example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use. Today you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font and much more. Another reason why is with iphones or i touches now you dont have to be at home you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to. To find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza but technollogy has come a long way. So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didnt knew before and finally computers have changed a lot and they are apart of our technology. .Jingle bells, jingle bells,   Jingle all the way!.What I have to say can't wait, all I need is a day,      [Bridge]   So let's runaway for the day,   And I'll

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I @CAPS3't you agree that computers benefit society? I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial. Thank you for your time..The debt is all yours   Now I'm going away   I got a feeling someday you'll repay..I've seen the lonely side of living   I never want to go back there again   The sad old me is dyin'   Tonight there is no denyin'      I ain't mama's little girl no more   And baby, you're the first to know   I ain't mama's little girl no more   I took a little time to grow   It's gonna be worth waiting   The anticipating   I'm not mama's little baby no more      I ain't mama's little girl no more   And baby, you're the first, the first to know   I ain't mama's little girl no more   I took a little time, a time to grow   It's gonna be worth the waiting   The anticipating   I'm not mama's little baby no more, no more      I ain't mama's little girl no more   And baby, you're the first, the first to know   I said I ain't mama's little girl no, no more   I took a little time, a time to grow   It's gonna be worth the waiting   The anticipating   I'm not mama's little baby no more, no more.Yeah!.Almighty blues   I've never felt so lonely, since I lost my one and only      I can't go the distance   I can't close the door   Feel alone in a crowd   I can't take no more      [Chorus]      Don't need a reason   To be in your game   With a loser's luck   It's nothin' but a cryin' shame      [Chorus].All the cattle are standing like statues,   All the cattel are standing like statues,   They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by..Sing out..You can find someone   And live your life   Put an old memory out of your mind   But the heart never forgets..The old man had shown the way then..Work it out, take that thing d-down to the floor now!.You didn't think about anyone else   You didn't think about any of us   When you left that place   You didn't wanna go anywhere else   Nothing could satisfy you to you left   So you went away   Where you go?.Mother please forgive them   For they know not what they do   Looking back in history's books   It seems it's nothing new   Oh!.Oh, if I could only make time stand still for a moment   Capture a memory live it one more time, would I believe   That I would really change a thing   A second chance to get it right   I think the end is close at hand   I had a vision I don't understand   Don't you see, I was made for you and you for me   Close your eyes, are you ready for a big surprise      Oh, hold the clock say the words to make it stop now   Slam bam thank you maam   Wasn't it a pleasant life we shared, who really cares   Why pretend you don't remember   Wipe it clean and start it again   Hope to see you in the summer..How bad do you want it?.Oh, girl,   Where'd you get   Those shoes?.You're dancing in quicksand..When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome,   [Bette:] she wore the dress and I stayed home..Nous irons jouer dans l'isle   Sur le bord de l'eau dans l'isle..Give me a reason to get out alive      Give me a reason cause' I got nothing to gain   So what are we doing now?.If I wasn't a songbird   How could I call you?.Mr. Popeil!.But I've been sober three years now   'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey      Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl   The way she adored that string of pearls   I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl   Married his high school love."
"As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has a extremely positive effect on people. Computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer are; teach hand-eye coordination. give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last hit not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explaine more about what a positve effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just ga off and playing video games on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. when you use the computer there os so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a in your socical or history about the country or and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand-eye coordination. First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skills, you should try to look at the computer screan. and not be working down at you finger keys. Not only is that not helping you hand-eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truely is unbelievable. Are you one of those people who's parents don't you get a phone because use of how much it costs without even the cost of texting? Well if you are, the computer help you out with that problem aswell!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use @CAPS1 to instant your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The comp. is so hanndy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w/ hand-eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the comp is a in every household..Nigga nigga nigga, can't you see   Somehow your words incarcerate me   Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee   Lock me up in my prime, Muhammad Ali   Get

"Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have an bad effect on people. I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up. I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adult to. That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effects is just helpful ness..'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby      Uh, check it out, nine-fo' shit for dat ass   Puff Daddy, Biggie Smalls, Junior M.A.F.I.A, represent baby, baby!.Lord, do I dare?.No no, no no, oh, yeah,   I gotta go, yeah,   I've gotta go,   I, I, I, I've gotta go, outside,   In the rain..She's gonna know it in a matter of time..that I need you   Honest I do, need you every moment   In your eyes, I read such strange things   But your lips deny they're true   Will your answer really change things   Making me blue?.[Chorus]   Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue..I guess that our being together..In the 'land of the free'   Dance!.You bought me dime packs,   Felt like we were famous..Take the jib sail down boys take the jib sail down   Turn this ship around boys before we run aground   The fish aren't bitin' today boys fish aren't bitin' today   I'm gonna lay on my bunk and get drunk as a sunk cause the fish aren't bitin' today      There's six foot waves and my stomach craves some good old Antiguan Rum   I took some away for a rainy day and the rain she is startin' to come now   Take the jib sail down boys....Livin' hard and looking older than her years   Miss Little Big Town   Trying to hold a job down   Doing what she could to choke her fears      But she was strong   And she would survive   A spark of hope had kept her dream alive   And she cried....Why this joy when you touch my cheek?.Got me tired again      Hey   Drive two miles an hour down a mountain trail   Don't go any faster, gonna lose my way   Can't go any faster, gonna lose my way   Right on the mountain, snow today      Heeeeeeeey   Heeeeeeeey   Again we play      Giddyup giddyup away   Giddyup giddyup away      Gonna be late if we don't find our way   Hurry, yeah   Oh hustle   Oh hustle   Ohhh away...

woman every day a different town   If I'm not accused of speeding I'm accused of coming down   With a legal dose of something that you heard was going round   And you wondered why I lost my sense of humor   Every song another record every day just like a clock   Knowing well I've had to take it till I make it to the top   With the devil right behind me and my heart about to stop   Then you wondered why I lost my sense of humor   Twenty years I was in prison more than that I was alone   Some lily-white reporter thinks it's time that I was stoned   Without sin he wrote the story and it chilled me to the bone   Then he wondered why I lost my sense of humor   I shaved my beard and cut my hair off it don't matter anyhow   It was truth that told the answers to the questions up till now   Crucify him someone shouted from the safety of the crowd   Then they wondered why I lost my sense of humor   Hey take them crosses from my doorstep there's no reason to my rhyme   Everybody knows somebody will take care of me in time   I made friends of all you stand for but the blind can't lead the blind   Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of humor   Just be glad I haven't lost my sense of

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive effect on people. Spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so important that have throuhout school teaching us how to type. we also use hand-eye coordination is loaded and. You have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the. Computers are helpful in many ways. Have you ever about what looks like or what would be found on it? With a computer you can. Comuputers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get pictures some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who lies there. Yes, you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life easier. Computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. They give you the oppurtunity to talk with people online whether the world the street. In order to do this you need a web. They are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. Its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country. Its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spanding to much time an computer and not on exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. All of these things should be. All you have to do is manage your time. Or not all day on the computer. If you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created.

"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee.

"Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to eachother. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along. His buisiness transfered @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh-air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vaction. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vaction because they don't know about the country or place..Baby don't go, don't go, not now..Stealing a moment from Mr. Time   He rocks in his chair like a shiny dime   But it's all for show, all for show..Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do?.While I was down in W.D.C..And now the air is clear, my dear and you're still here and so   A certain surprise, give you my sweet certain surprise   Silence has never been my thing   I'm one of those, I love to shout and sing about my love   Sweet flying dove, there's no one above, sweet certain surprise      Soft and certain, tell the moon?.Give me love like her,   'Cause lately I've been waking up alone,   Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt,   Told you I'd let them go,   And that I'll fight my corner,   Maybe tonight I'll call ya,   After my blood turns into alcohol,   No, I just wanna hold ya..[Chorus]      Would you let me know your plans tonight?.Extra!.(What a girl)   Fat girls   (Yum)   (What a girl) Woo   Fat girls, Oooouhhh      OoooOh!.I'm ready, hey   Boy come and get me   Don't be scared   Show me what you do   Don't you know a girl   Like a boy who moves.I pray that it's still alive      You can't stop yourself   Don't want to feel   Don't want to see what you've become   You can't walk away   From who you are   Never give in      Where is the edge   Of your darkest emotions?.A shoulder to cry on, get high or die on maybe?.(with N Sync)      You'll never know, what you've done for me   What your faith in me, has done for my soul   You'll never know the gift you've given me   I'll carry it with me, yeah yeah      Through the days ahead I'll think of days before   You made me hope for something better   And made me reach for something more      You taught me to run   You taught me to fly   Helped me to free the me inside   Helped me hear the music of my heart   Helped me hear the music of my heart   You opened my eyes   You opened the door   To something I've never known before   And your love, is the music of my heart   (music of my heart)      You were the one, always on my side   (always on my side)   Always standing by   (always standing by)   Seeing me through   You were the song that always made me sing   (made me sing)   I'm singing this for you   Everywhere I go, I'll think of where I've been   And all of ones who knew me better then any One ever will again      You taught me to run   You taught me to fly   Helped to free the me inside   Helped me hear the music of my heart   Helped me hear the music of my heart   You opened my eyes you opened the door   To something I've never known before   And your love, is the music of my heart      What you've taught me   Only your love could ever teach me   You got through when no one could reach me before   'Cause you always saw in me   All the best that I could be   It was you who set me free      You taught me to run   You taught me to fly   Helped me to free the me inside   Helped me hear the music of my heart   Helped me hear the music of my heart      You taught me to run   You taught me to fly   Helped me to free the me inside   (me inside) Helped me hear the music of my heart   (music of my heart)   Helped me hear the music of my heart   You opened my eyes   You opened the door   To something I've never known before   And your love, is the music of my heart      Music of my heart   Music of my heart   Is the music of my heart.And, when the bell rang for lunch..Care not for the men who wonder   Straw that broke your back, you're under   Cast all them aside who care   Empty eyes and dead end stare      Pre-chorus:   Don't you know that none are blind   To the lie, and you think I don't find..   what you hide?.Does it get any better?.Living eyes when out in the rain will fall..If I should understand just why I need you by me   Then I would know the reasons for the songs of morning   'Cause if I wanted you yesterday   And if in the night we shared our hearts   Whatever it is that you done to me   Between you and me, can't be undone...

"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living..Aa aa   Raat barasaat ki, pahali mulaaqaat ki   Yaad rakho balamaa- 3   Yaad rakho balama, jo ruuthne ki baat thi      Buund buund barase, dil mera tarase   Pahali pahali baar piya, nikali huun gharase- 2   Chori chori aake sainyyaa- 2   Main ne mulaaqaat ki   Raat barasaat ki      Bijali ne roka, paani ne toka   Chali aayi sochake jo hoga so hogaa- 2   Tere liye thand sahi- 2   Bhigi bhigi raat mein   Raat barasaat ki.Roll me, baby, roll your big, brown eyes..We're truly making love..I know I'm artificial   But don't put the blame on me   I was reared with appliances   In a consumer society      When I put on my make-up   The pretty little mask not me   That's the way a girl should be   In a consumer society      My existence is elusive   The kind that is supported   By mechanical resources      My existence is elusive   The kind that is supported   By mechanical resources      I want to be Instamatic   I want to be a frozen pea   I wanna be dehydrated   In a consumer society      In a consumer society   In a consumer society.And by the way before you go   I'd like to say   I love you so   If it's goodbye maybe for good   I will not cry   Maybe I should   And I   I love you so   Oh how this year has slipped away   We shed no tears   So why today   And all this time has made me feel   Love is no crime   And love is real   And I   Ooh!.You must go your way,   And I must go mine..Or when you thought you were wrong..It must have been love but it's over now..Goin' back to school   Savin' up my tuition   Gonna rewrite all the rules   On the old blackboard..A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade   Laying everybody low with a love song that he made   He finds a streetlight and he steps out of the shade   And says something like, ?You and me babe, how about it??.See'mon and slide over..Ignore the writing on the wall,   You should read between the lies..The loving another name   The truth is nobody can love you like I can   It's a damn shame   We can't even get along   We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?.With me, with me   Why don't you go there with me?.Diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit diddit didda..That's the first time in my life I felt like the opposite sex..Blow into this paperbag,   Go home, stop grinning at everyone..If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me   Ain't that the truth?, I'm bulletproof off the roof   I got a mic and a fix, that'll jack you for your tooth   I'm out for rep, but how long will it last?.Hhhh!.She has six swans singing in her sauna   So she can't hear what's going on   No she can't hear what's going on   In the outside world   In the outside world   In the outside   Bad black and white men   Standing in their pigpen   Selling guns to simpletons   To shoot 'em in the abdomen   And she's not interested in that   And she's not interested in that   She has six swans singing in her sauna   Outside - world - outside      She has eleven lions laughing at her lakeside   So she can't hear what's going on   No she can't hear what's going on   In the outside world   In the outside world   In the outside   Bad brown and yellow men   Splitting on their fellow men   Drape her in a newspaper   And stab her with a poison pen   She's not interested in that   She's not interested in that   She has eleven lions laughing at her lakeside   Outside - world - outside      You can keep your animals   All the noise and the din   Just make a little space for me   I'm coming in.Every time I go to London   I think about Giuseppe Conlon   Who left his home in Belfast   And travelled over to his son   As he said goodbye to Sarah   And took the boat to Heysham   Little did Giuseppe know   He'd never see that place again."
"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world..We all walk the long road..And all it really needed was the proper point of view..Yea....We got something to say   Ya know   It's one of those joints here      Yolanda   Umm, Hmm....YING YANG!!!.Let's get down   Because they need more break and now it's sliced by Shay   The records out so don't wait   The style that I'm doin', it'll ruin   All you people came here just for booin'   Get your dead ass up and back on the floor   Jump in the groove and let Vanilla go   Insane, with my gold chain   You know you're gonna' see it on Soul Train..[Chorus: x2]      Yeah so low down, I know, low down dirty mean, ah!.And he's so smart and independent, I don't think he needs me   Quite half as much as I know I need him   I wonder why there's not another girl that he'd prefer      And when I feel like giving up   Like my world is falling down      I show up at 3am   He's still up watching Vacation, and I   See his pretty face   It takes me away to a better place and      (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine   (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine      Yeah, my boyfriend takes collect calls from the road   And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge   He laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does   He brings me mexican food from Sombrero's just because      And when I feel like giving up   Like my world is falling down      I show up at 3am   He's still up watching Vacation, and I   See his pretty face   It takes me away to a better place and      (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine   (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine   (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine   (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine      (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine   (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine   (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine   (I know that everything [3x]) Everything's gonna be fine.We'll build our house in the trees..Deadly as the viper   Peering from its coil   The poison there is coming to the boil      Ticking like a time bomb   The fuse is running short   on the verge of snapping if it's caught      And all the pressure that's been building up   For all the years it bore the load   The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort   Ready to explode      Jawbreaker      Crouching in the corner   Wound up as a spring   Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering      Muscles are all contorted   Claws dug in the dirt   Every ounce of fiber on alert.Spillin' wine wine and sharin' good times   She sure could make him smile..He heard they eat three meals a day, just across the Rio Grande..But it's over, tears I have cried..There's an uncle there who cares a little about me and he won't let the poor boy down..What the hell am I?.So, I'm gonna keep on trying, just keep on trying till I win your love, woo..And I'd like to stay but I can't because   I've been fooling around and I know   That you called because you never even knew   That it was hurting me..Boy I have been searching   Everywhere for you but I can't   Seem to find you anywhere it's like   You didn't exist but to me and I will   Do anyhthing to find you   (Chours)   Someday I will find you   And ask you why you left me   Broken hearted but boy oh boy   Don't you that someday oh someday   I will find you yehhh..Bolt-lock your doors   Alarm your cars   And still we move in closer   Every day   Top of the list   Is your smiling kids   But we'll be smiling too   So that's ok   Oh, and by the way   Thank you, because you're   Giving, giving, giving   And we're receiving -   No, no, we're taking   Keeping the population down   Your taxes paid, but   Police waylaid   And we knows   When the school bus   Comes and goes   We're on your street, but   You don't see us   Or, if you do   You smile and say Hello   But don't underestimate us   When you are   Giving, giving, giving   And we're receiving -   No, no, we're taking   We're just keeping   The population down   Giving, giving, giving   Well, it's your own fault   For reproducing   We're just keeping   The population down.Tonight these crowds   Are happy and loud   Children are up dancing in the streets   In the sticky middle of the night   Summer serenade   Of taxi horns and fun arcades   Where right or wrong   Under neon   Every feeling goes on!"
"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration.

"Has a computer helped you ever answerd hard question or type up an essay for school for work? I know a computer has helped me far years so why would I teminate it or want it gone. Heres the controversy, many experts believe computers don't benefit society but people, such as myself, believe the exact oppositte. Their are many benefits to oconing a computer such as they're always a source of information, allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, have their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamon. He never found the diamond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. due to a computer he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of. also, computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones, with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication. for example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss, you can even choose what type of handwriting it types. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. Althourgh, some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addition. Still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work..Joe and Tonka trucks   But I want butts, livin' first class delux   15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks   My older brother was touched   It's a game where you don't play gotta have cane   Crack house for my birthday   The next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police   In a rage he lived but he payed the price   Caught with keys 25 to life   Takin' in by the crew time to standed on my own two (c'mon nigga)   But as I marinated thinkin' about the hood   I really can't remember my body doin' good   For long big decisions somebody got to make 'em   Undercover recognize the face now can't shake a   Phone tap (what) and now I'm in the belly of the beast   Use to sittin' in leather sheets now I'm sittin' awaitin' release   Visitors day, my younger brother came down   Put the toys down excited about the first round   He bust I was crushed to finally see   The solution to the problem could of started with me   It's on now      There's no escape from the ones who harassin'   The reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'   Now I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'   But season after season they recycle assassins now.Yesterday's gone   Love lead me on, oh   I won't ask why      Roll away it's only time and the river   Roll away to the endless sea   Roll away it could all change tomorrow   This is life in it's glory   And the river runs free   Roll away      My dreams build the walls of the city   Broken hearts tear them all down   It ain't always easy and pretty   It's just the world turning around   Give us this day   Give us this night, oh   It'll be all right      Roll away it's only time and the river   Roll away to the endless sea   Roll away it could all change tomorrow   This is life in it's glory   And the river runs free   Oh, roll away      Everyday when I look in the mirror   I try to see where my soul's at now      Roll away it's only time and the river   Roll away to the endless sea   Roll away it could all change tomorrow   This is life in it's glory   And the river runs free      Roll away it's only time and the river   Roll away to the endless sea   Roll away it could all change tomorrow   This is life in it's glory   And the river runs free   Roll away, ahh, oh   Ahh, ha, ho.Calling out the names, faces   Uniforms I've worn   And all that is gone   Always climbing   To fall down again   Holding onto everything   It's not what it seems.Tonight, cause I want to get high..The Slide   Make a drug of my senses   I'll get you out of your head   I'm sick for you   Love wastes us together   Love holds us together   Love folds us together   Flowers      V.

"I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the "" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives @NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games. And lastly you want your daughter to go to yale or do you want her to fail.

"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers affect our country in a positive way. Three reasons why I think so are comunication, @CAPS2, entertainment and, @CAPS3. One of my favorite things to do is talk and when on of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number I thought we had no way of doing it. One day he requested me on facebook and from there on we have been comunicating on web sites like facebook, myspace and, skype. My second reason why computer's benifit our society is @CAPS2. At my dad's house I do not have a television so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world. A website called @CAPS4.com was the frist to anounce @PERSON1's death befor anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break rest on the internet. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, comunicate with friends. The last reason why computers benefit our society is @CAPS3. Many @CAPS3 in our comunity require computer skills such as a acountant, a manager, software designner, and a computer programer.

"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is great concern about computers and wether or not people spend to much time sitting infront of the screen or not. I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising, enjoying, and being with family and friends. Exercising is a major part of every persons life and if you don't get enough of it you could become obeise. Obeisity @MONTH1 cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don't care what others think, but in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way. exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny joy, go for a walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant 'in person? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn't you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would and I think most other people would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, nature, and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life..I've got an achin' in my heart   Arson on my mind   I'm gonna burn your playhouse down   I've got a badly broken heart   I've bad it from the start   You're giving me the run around   Now if you play with fire   It's a-sure to burn   I've beard this all of my life   Go on, be on your way, I've bad my say   Well honey, I'm through with you for life   You'll find I'm there's one in every yard   I'm getting mighty tired   I'm gonna burn your playhouse down   Now don't pretend that this is the end   'cause this time we're really through   While you were runflin' 'round   Burning up the town   I was settin' a trap for you   I've got an achin' in my heart   Arson on my mind   I'm gonna burn your playhouse down..I slaved for you, baby, and gave you such a wonderful start....I know how it feels to have wings on your heels..Lyrics for Animal Songs   6 Little Ducks   Traditional   From the album More Singable Songs   Six little ducks that I once knew   Fast ones, skinny ones, fair ones too..I feel I never told you   The story of the ghost   That I once knew and talked to   Of whom I'd never boast      For this was my big secret   How I'd get ahead   And never have to worry   I'd call him instead      His answer came in actions   He never spoke a word   Or maybe I laid down the phone   Before he could be heard      I somehow feel forsaken   Like he had closed the door   I guess I just stopped needing him   As much as once before      But maybe he's still with me   The latch was left unhooked   He's waiting in the wind and rain   I simply haven't looked.Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah..Lux venit lux venit   Lux venit sursum corda   Lux venit lux venit arise   Shine for your light has come   By sword by flame   In death solemn ages passed   And voices young   Grow old weary   Holding fast   Hope for the dawning      Lux venit lux venit   Lux venit sursum corda   Lux venit lux venit arise   Shine for your light has come      In grace in might   The babe lay in stable stark   Redemptions's light   Pierces through the shadows dark   Alleluia      Lux venit lux venit   Sursum corda   Lux venit lux venit arise   Shine for your light has come      Lux venit lux venit   Lux venit sursum corda   Lux venit lux venit arise   Shine for your light has come      Alleluia.Sail on, darlin', sail on   Woman, you go your way, and I'll go mine   Seems to me, that I once heard   That everything is finally cured by time   So sail on, darlin', sail on   Lord, I wish you good luck   And I'll see you when you come next time..if you see him..Are you low?.Look at me, I'm shaking,   I don't know if I can move      I don't need   This attention again   I've lost time   I could lose everything   You will learn   That you've nowhere to go so go.Handguns in the hands of the young   And diss all this paranoia, yo, there's much slugs for everyone      [Chorus: x4]      We need to rise (rise), as if we live with our eyes (eyes)   Stay away from the hate (hate), before it's too late (before it's too late)   We go ah      [Chorus: x4]      We gotta rise.A waltz is played.].Angel voices, ever singing, round Thy throne of light   Angel harps, forever ringing, rest not day or night   Thousands only live to bless Thee, and confess Thee Lord of might..I told you it was all a game   Whenever I see you or your work   It makes me feel like spitting   What's that noise?.I know I should fight   But my old man he's really alright,   And I'm still living at home   Even though it won't last..I've spent so many years in question   To find I've known this all along..I'm running out of my time   I'm running out of breath   And now it's getting so   I can't sleep at night   In the day, feel like death      I'm getting in far too deep   I feel them closing in   I've got to say that I'm scared   I know they'll win   Even so, I'm prepared      Do you believe, what you hear   Can you believe, what you see   Do you believe, what you feel   Can you believe      What is real?.it's hard to be a winner ev'ry time,   but I know you can take it, you can make it alright..I got my eye on you   Got my eye on you      I'm walking down by the water's edge   Feel like I'm coming apart   I'm so afraid of this jealous rage   That's taken hold of my heart      And, boy, I do."

"People the computer is something good and cool. Why is cool? is cool because the computer help you in everything. I have reasons. The first reasons is when in your school you have homework, work, project or something like that the computer help you a lot. Because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side. The second reason is the computer help you in your house for example: You have the big problem with your car or something like that. You can go in the computer in @LOCATION1 and the you see the pieces of your car. The thrid reason for the computer is so cool is because in this time you can make the everything thing. We can go the web and facilitate our life. Now you can realize the work, homework, project, ideas, writting book, chat, information, print picture, and ect... And that you are architect you can make your proper work or house you see the computer is so cool. But some people use the computer for bad thing for example: for pornography or something bad this is not cool and is not appropiate for people. The computer is something fabolous and super genius. My opinion is that the computer help a lot is something like need in our life. No for live but for our life or something @CAPS1. Something you can see your family for webcam. This is fabolous but don't used the webcam for something bad you can learn thing that you don't know. I think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing. Appraise the computer.

"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 would a person do with out a computer? Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you @MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you @MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way. .Eight..Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world..Put on a ton of make-up and then stare at the camera lens   Greeting all the viewers with a ""Hi-hi-hip-hello!"".Is it something I forgot to do?.Bury me softly in this womb   I give this part of me for you   Sand rains down and here I sit   Holding rare flowers   In a tomb, in bloom      Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved   See my heart I decorate it like a grave   You don't understand who they   Thought I was supposed to be   Look at me now a man   Who won't let himself be      Down in a hole, feeling so small   Down in a hole, losing my soul   I'd like to fly,   But my wings have been so denied      Down in a hole and they've put all   The stones in their place   I've eaten the sun so my tongue   Has been burned of the taste   I have been guilty   Of kicking myself in the teeth   I will speak no more   Of my feelings beneath      Down in a hole, feelin' so small   Down in a hole, losin' my soul   I'd like to fly but my   Wings have been so denied      Bury me softly in this womb   Oh I want to be inside of you   I give this part of me for you   Oh I want to be inside of you   Sand rains down and here I sit   Holding rare flowers   (Oh I want to be inside of you)   In a tomb, in bloom   Oh I want to be inside      Down in a hole, feelin' so small   Down in a hole, losin' my soul   Down in a hole, feelin' so small   Down in a hole, outta control   I'd like to fly but my   Wings have been so denied.You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie      Sit down you creep, you degenerate son of a sheep      What am I to do you... with you ?.Ah, they'll be the death of you   If something else doesn't get you first..((trash it up cause we ain't through)) (oh yeah)   Yeah hit it, it's time to get with it, huh   I ain't no angel so 2 hell with playin' innocent (oh daddy)   Those who came to party know just what I'm talking about   So come on y'all (oh yeah)   Wave your hand in the air, everybody   Wave your hand in the air (oh daddy)   For the funkiest band in the land and don't forget   The p-a-r-t-y-m-a-n (oh yeah)      Peace (daddy pop) (oh daddy)   Yeah, peace (daddy pop) (oh yeah)   Like I said right about now (daddy pop) (oh daddy)   Npg is like a (daddy pop) (oh yeah).Jah-Jah live!.How do you feel when you lie?.Closest thing to heaven   Hey   Closest thing to heaven.Baby don't tell me you miss me, you love me   Don't whisper gently that you can't forget me   Tonight, tonight 'cause I've heard it all before   Just turn away, don't play that game   Baby I don't want to anymore   Let it all fade away   Don't you know that love is gone   It's too late, everything fades away   Nothing ever stays the same   Baby, no, no, no   Don't tell me you're sorry you hurt me   How many times can I give in?.The resurrection is here to say   That He's coming back again      To reclaim all His souls, reclaim all His souls,   Reclaim all His souls, reclaim all His souls, [Repeat: x 3].Can't be sure where you are, wander on blessed James..Looking at the rain   Feeling the pain   Of love lost running though   My brain   Looking at the wind   Watching it spin   The leaves along the street   You win      Waiting for a line to fall   Telling you it's all a big mistake      Looking at a face   So out of place   Inside that picture frame   Of lace   Looking at the wall   Wishing you'd call   And tell me you're okay   That's all      Wishing this was all a dream   And I'd find you sleeping when I wake      Looking at the trees   So ill at ease   From sleep that will not come   That's me   Looking at the dawn   Knowing it's wrong   Still thinking of your love   That's gone      Wishing this was all a dream   And I'd find you sleeping when I wake      Looking at the rain   Feeling the pain   Of love lost running though   My brain   Looking at the wind   Watching it spin   The leaves along the street   You win      Waiting for a line to fall   Telling you it's all a big mistake   But the words won't come   I know I'd feel the same   Looking at the rain.Oh just let her pass by.?, females hugs   I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs   I get threats over the two way from email thugs      I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs   Think I'm liking you?.Stratospheric traces of our transitory flight   Trails of condensation held   In narrow paths of white   The sun is turning black   The world is turning gray   All the stars fade from the night   The oceans drain away      Horizon to horizon   Memory written on the wind   Fading away, like an hourglass, grain by grain   Swept away like voices in a hurricane      In a vapor trail      Atmospheric phases make the transitory last   Vaporize the memories that freeze the fading past   Silence all the songbirds   Stilled by the killing frost   Forests burn to ashes   Everything is lost      Washed away like footprints in the rain      In a vapor trail.And as her young man dies   On a cold and grey Chicago morn   Another little baby child is born in the ghetto.What I'm trying to say is that tomorrow's the day   And we've got to do it over again..And seasons come and seasons go   And what goes up comes down, and baby soon you'll know      I'm gonna wait my time   I will stand in line   And it will turn out fine   And our love will grow   Because I know   Baby yes I know      Everything that comes around, goes around   Everything that goes around, comes around someday   Everything that comes around, goes around   Everything that goes around, comes around someday      So you can go and leave me now   You see it don't make any difference   Go on and leave me now   'Cause you'll be back sometime in my life   There may be some other ones   And you might think some better ones      But if I wait my time   If I stand in line   It will turn out fine   And our love will grow   Because I know   Baby yes I know      Everything that comes around, goes around   And everything that goes around, comes around someday   Everything that comes around, goes around   Everything that goes around, comes around someday      Everything that comes around, (everything) goes around (I'm gonna be here   Babe)   Everything that goes around, comes around someday   Everything that comes around, goes around   Everything that goes around, comes around someday      So let it turn around      Everything that comes around, goes around   Everything that goes around, (everything) comes around (someday) someday   Everything that comes around, goes around, oh-oh-aaah   Everything that goes around, comes around someday, yeah"
"I remember when computer wernt so popular. Back then I had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio. Now computers are very popular. I believe that computers have positive effect on people @DATE1 because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to acess them. You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. Which is good because its much easier. For example im a student that can't draw so printed some pictures of the computer so I can paste them on my post board. So in the other words the computer is useful for students. I know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or its a zero. In this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of intersting because you can up with friend that you haven't seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantaes because you would have nvever thought you will see your friend doing. Another thing about computers that you can fint stuff cheaper than everyday lif say if you want to a trip and you call @ORGANIZATION1 for your ticket. The ticket came up to . But you go on the computer and you on @ORGANIZATION1 website and find your ticket to florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a restion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convince. At home if my labtop is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what to do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to acess one! In this generation everybody is rushing and computers..I don't know why, I don't know how   If I can fly, can I fly now?.Please stop saying there ain't nothing wrong..Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I,   Ever had boy..We were sitting round a dying fire   Somebody lit incense   Somebody lit a cigarette   And passed a bottle around   It was just strawberry season   Backbreaking pickers in the patches   Everythings burning down to ashes   And down to the ground   She's saving me   I don't even think she knows it   It's a strange way to show it as distant as   Last nights dream unravels   She's saving me   I'm a very lost soul   I was born with a hole in my heart   The size of my land locked travels      I try to put it aside   But it's too much bigger than me   There's a big brown hawk in the tree   Lighting and leaving   And there's tea leaves tossing   Heads up pennies in my pocket   Dead star like a rocket   The arc of my grieving   She's saving me   I don't even think she knows it   Its a strange way to show it   As distant as last nights dream unravels   She's saving me   I'm a very lost soul   I was born with a hole in my heart   The size of my land locked travels      The sky pours out biblical rain   Then days so still the beauty gives you pain   The heatwave kills the green   And she remains unseen   But colors up my dreams   With all things blooming      This is not all there is   It's not a kingdom   It's not an angry god   It feels like her   It feels like no fear   It feels like no doubt   It feels like inside out   The ashes stir   She's saving me   I don't even think she knows it   Such a strange way to show it as distant as   Last nights dream unravels   She's saving me   I'm a very lost soul   I was born with a hole in my heart   The size of my land locked travels.I hear him,   Before I go to sleep,   And focus on the day that's been,   I realize he's there,   When I turn the light off,   And turn over,   Nobody knows about my man,   They think he's lost on some horizon,   And suddenly I find myself listening,   To a man I've never known before,   Telling me about the sea,   Oh his love is to eternity..(we came across the country lickety-split)   (Rollin' ninety miles an hour)   I can't believe I'm here at last   Woo-oo-ooo!.Think about me, drink about me, I don't care,   'Cause now I realise the shape I'm in..One more kiss, dear, one more sigh   Only this dear, is goodbye   For our love is such pain and such pleasure   That I'll treasure till I die   So for now dear, au revoir ma belle   But I bow dear, not farewell   For in time we may have a love's glory   Our love story to tell   Just as every autumn leaves fall from the tree   Tumble to the ground and die   So in the springtime like sweet memories   They will return as will I   Like the sun dear, upon high   We'll return dear, to the sky   And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow   Until tomorrow, goodbye   One more kiss dear, one more sigh   Only this dear, is goodbye   For our love is such passion, such pleasure   I will treasure until till I die   Like the sun dear, upon high   We'll return dear, to the sky   And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow   Until tomorrow, goodbye.Wild mountain thyme : to the mcpeake family of belfast   Oh the summer time is coming   And the trees are sweetly bloomin'   And the wild mountain thyme   Grows around the bloomin' heather   Will ye go lassie go and we'll all go together   To pluck wild mountain thyme?.I hope and pray   That someday   That I'll be the vision of your happiness..Save the world, feed the hungry people, show them we love and care..Oh please come home with me,   Oh don't you wanna marry me?.Desire....Wearing your name and a number or two   When the minute's up, so are you   But everybody knows, everybody knows..You gotta have love      If you want schooling baby   I'll be around,   I'm ready for fooling   But, don't hang around..You've come to me again my friend..This shit   This shit, this shit   My life, my life   Nigga this shit brazy   Nigga this shit brazy   This shit, this shit   This shit brazy   This shit, this shit   This shit brazy   Nigga this shit brazy, oh Lord!.Manic depression's touching my soul   I know what I want but I just don't know   How to, huh, go about gettin' it   Feeling sweet feeling,   Drops from my fingers, fingers   Manic depression's a catchin' my soul   Woman so weary, the sweet cause in vain   You make love, you break love   It's, a, all the same   When it's, when it's over, baby   Music, sweet music   I wish I could caress, caress, caress   Manic depression's a frustrating mess   you'ow!.Faster than sound   Faster than sound   Faster than sound, hey   Faster than sound   Faster than sound, alright   Faster than sound   Thank you..Mmm..I'm on a mexican radio   I'm on a mexican radio      I dial it in and tune the station   They talk about the you."
"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh tha's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise. .Reporters crowd around   Your house..Pull up in the yard, ten sets   He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding   Who testing?.Les love, les sex, les drugs, les

glancing at the switch   I hear them whispering maybe it's better that way   I see the love turn into feelings   I know   Aren't quite the same      I see the men of learning   Pacing to and fro   But how can I expect the sane to ever know?.Eat through the mounds of steel,   Sift through the metal..Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind      Dark and silent, late last night,   I think I might have

around me   Still I'm on the dark side of the moon   And it seems like it goes on like this forever   You must forgive me, if I'm up and gone to   Carolina in my mind      In my mind I'm goin' to

questions rise, on wings of chance you fly   And on that day your laughs and tears will die   And fall as free as seabirds climb the skies   And you will love when love comes your way   And when it comes there's nothing more to say   And now you know he doesn't understand   And now you know you don't need his hand   One day the questions die, on wings of chance you fly.I can virtually do

I am lucky I am   To be the one who fills your eyes   Blowin' away, sails on a lake   Flyin' like a flag in the sky   Bright colored balloons in the wind   That's how lucky I am   (how lucky I am)      Now the road is rising up to meet me   And my half empty cup is filled completely   And I'm drinking that sweet taste of rain   So grateful for each moment I get   To have found you   I could have walked on by   But the stars were on my side.I drop my hat   To a restless wind   This time I'm not gonna chase it again   In a jigsaw dream with soft spoken words      I woke up crying and no one heard   You're looking through me like I never was real   You say you love me but you won't let me feel   So I'm gonna take a chance this time      I'm gonna find myself some place where I can heal   And I'm heading west   Without a sad goodbye   And I'm heading west      I'm like a letter with no address   Just like a book I read   I'm heading west   I said my name      Under my breath   He turned down a twisted road   I won't forget   I'm gonna fly my kite and let out all the string      Hold on to hope, let go everything   I can't stop laughing and it's nothing you said   The altitude of freedom seems to go to my head   And if I fall down on my knees I'm gonna get back up      I'm gonna get back up again   And I'm heading west   Without a sad goodbye   And I'm heading west      I'm like a letter with no address   Just like a book I read   I'm heading west   And I'm heading west...   Just like a book I read....Don't want a nation under the new media."
"Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication..She use to be my rosa amarilla   My little Mexicali tomatilla   But then one night I drank too much sangria   Woke up and found a note that said I'll see ya      (Chorus)   Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more   My baby no esta aqui no more   She left me here with nada   Broke my heart like a pinata   My baby no esta aqui no more      Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her   Please, please tell her that I need her      I used to be her number one vaquero   Her numero uno caballero   But I've had to hock my spurs and my sombrero   'Cause when she left she took all my dinero      (Repeat Chorus)      Whoa, whoa, whoa, if you see her   Please, please tell her that I need her      Oh, my baby no esta aqui no more   My baby no esta aqui no more   she left me here with nada   Broke my heart like a pinata   My baby no esta aqui   My baby no esta aqui   My baby no esta aqui no more.Charades and pretty lies,   They hide what's deep inside me,   Charades do disguise,   All the love I keep inside me,   Charades can't see me,   But can you feel the real me,   The real me behind my Charades..I walk the thin line for you..Blackness awakens, visions come alive..And Andre are here to stay and never go away   Until our dying day, until we're old and gray   Marshall!.To the other side of morning   Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas      Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand..Oh!.I've got everything, everything but you..I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken   I'm accepted, You were condemned   I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me   Because You died and rose again      I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken   I'm accepted, You were condemned   I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me   Because You died and rose again      Amazing love, how can it be   That You my King would die for me   Amazing love, I know it's true   It's my joy to honor You   Amazing love, how can it be   That You my King would die for me   Amazing love, I know it's true   It's my joy to honor You   In all I do I honor You      I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken   I'm accepted, You were condemned   I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me   Because You died and rose again.All comes a faggot white boy..And blue blood will be dead..Question number seven: should I pick you up at a quarter to eleven?.Said I want you I need you, babe I've gotta have you,   I want you I need you, babe I've gotta have you,   I've been lonely in the morning   Hon, I've been lonely at night..I see the fizzle where the bombs fell on the beach..Like gasoline, a fire running wild..Your kiss..No one's going to give it away..No more cold, you got me hot!.Love it seems   Made flying dreams   So hearts, could soar..Took me to the deep blue ocean..And of your love that would not last as you told me."
"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!.I won't look back won't forget your smile   Oh no, hey hey hey we should do this again, we'd say..(Avril)      And I'd give up forever to touch you   'cause I know that you feel me somehow   You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be   And I don't want to go home right now      And all I can taste is this moment   And all I can breathe is your life   'cause sooner or later it's over   I just don't want to miss you tonight      And I don't want the world to see me   'cause I don't think that they'd understand   When everything's made to be broken   I just want you to know who I am      (Johnny)   And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming   Or the moment of truth in your lies   When everything feels like the movies   Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive      (Both)   And I don't want the world to see me   'cause I don't think that they'd understand   When everything's made to be broken   I just want you to know who I am      (Avril)   And I don't want the world to see me   'cause I don't think that they'd understand   When everything's made to be broken   I just want you to know who I am      (Both)   And I don't want the world to see me   'cause I don't think that they'd understand   When everything's made to be broken   I just want you to know who I am      I just want you to know who I am   I just want you to know who I am   I just want you to know who I am.Where's the light   Killed my day   Lost in the dark of your ways   Wasting my energy, endlessly   On your sweet lie      And if you don't mind   I would like to live the lie that I will survive   And, if you don't mind   I would love to slip away and leave your world behind      Feel secure, I'm not so sure   You're not just faking something   Wasting our last day   I can't take the pain      And if you don't mind   I would like to live the lie that I will survive   And, if you don't mind   I would love to slip away and leave it all behind      And if you don't mind   I would like to live the lie that I will survive   And if you don't mind   If you don't mind.Class clown, I already know I'm a star..It's

close   So you swallow another dose   The pinnacle of happiness   Filling up your soul   You don't think you can take any more   You never want to let go   To touch the roots of experience   The most basic ingredients   Toi see the unseen glitter of life   And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife   Cherish the certainty of now   It kills you a bit at a time   cradle the inspiration   It will

"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job..Boom!.Fault..But only because I'm in love with you..And things will never ever be the same again      She came

Turn back the clock, what I didn't say on the beach that day   I was afraid that you didn't feel everything I feel      Trying to keep it together without you around   You got me up here and now I can't seem to get down      Here it comes, taking over me   Close my eyes and I'm finally wondering will you   Here it comes, my own movie   In your arm where I wanna be wondering will you      Didn't wanna be 'cause of recently   You seem to suffer from the edges   Didn't wanna care if someone was there   How did you manage to open me up again?.Col mio amore riscaldar..GET DOWN   Baaaaarar

beer and I cursed all the people there   And I wish that all this raining would stop falling down on me      And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink   And mother wake me early in the morning      At the time I was working for a landlord   And he was the meanest bastard that you have ever seen   And to lose a single penny would grieve him awful sore   And he was a miserable bollocks and a bitch's bastard's whore      And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink   And mother wake me early in the morning      I recall we took care of him one Sunday   We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls   And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real   But all I know is I left that place without a penny or fuck all      And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink   And mother wake me early in the morning      But now I've the most charming of verandahs   I sit and watch the junkies, the drunks, the pimps, the whores   Five green bottles sitting on the floor   I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ   That I had fifteen more      And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink   And mother wake me early in the morning      And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink   And mother wake me early in the morning      The boys and me are drunk and looking for you   We'll eat your frigging entrails and we won't give a damn   Me daddy was a blue shirt and my mother a madam   And my brother earned his medals at Mai Lei in Vietnam      And it's lend me ten pounds and I'll buy you a drink   And mother wake me early in the morning      On the first day of March it was raining   It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen   Stay on the other side of the road   'Cause you can never tell   We've a thirst like a gang of devils   We're the boys of the county hell      And it's lend me ten pounds and I'll buy you a drink   And mother wake me early in the morning      And it's lend me ten pounds and I'll buy you a drink   And mother wake me early in the morning.Today I might snow, tomorrow I'll rain   3000's always changing but you stay the same   And I need that, hey I need that (In my life)   When I feel washed up and inadequate   And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get   You make me smile, you make me smile   You make me smile, you make me   You're the anchor that holds me down   When my ship is sinking   You won't let me drown and I'm grateful      [Chorus]      Yo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play   You'll always be this lovely   'Cause they raised you that way   Hallelujah!.Last night I realized   There's no point in compromise   I guess it's time we said it's over   'cause I been watchin' you   Searchin' for something' new   Go find it now 'cause it's all over   What's the sense in bitterness   It only leads to emptiness   I thought that we'd find happiness   But we've run out of track and we won't get it back   'cause it's over, it's all over   It's all over, it's over   I'm gonna have to

remember when you said to me   Take care when you share your love   Before you give it all so easily   Be sure that you can give enough   Look what happened to us   It's all over, it's over   Over, it's all over   It's all over, it's all over   We've run out of track and we won't get back   'cause it's over   No more me, no more you   It's over   It's all over.Say you need me, say you need me

"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society. Well I would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way. The computer is like a addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. I dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Every were you look theres a computer. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? .Let it go..It's all on my shoulders   And it was gettin' harder to bear   Each day I was gettin' older   And I was startin' to show the

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers have increased. You don't see kids outside as often. On the news, you hear about obesity. And you hear the crime rates go up. This does not benefit the socierty. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone's name and be underover. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick-minded people get to you or your kids. Take action now!.There is nothing new   I could give to you   Just a life that's torn   waiting to be born      Rivers overflow   friends may come and go   But you've been by my side   with every tear I've cried      Oh, I can't believe that You'd give everything for me   I can't believe it no, I can't believe it no, no   I know You never lied and so it's just my foolish pride   That I just won't receive it yeah   It's so hard to receive it in my heart and make the start with you      Help me, help me now   I just don't know how   You know, I've been so alone   please melt this heart of stone      La, la, la, la      Oh, I can't believe that You'd give everything for me   I can't believe it no, I can't believe it no, no   I know You never lied and so I'm giving up my pride   So I can receive it yeah   I just want to receive it in my heart and make the start with you      La, la, la.Can we get it together   Can we still walk side by side   Can we make it last   Like a musical

luxuriant cars   Girls in garages, stripped   Out to get liquor and clothes   Half gallons of wine and six-packs of beer   Jumped, humped, born to suffer   Made to undress in the wilderness..All the wisdom of people she used..With you it's always lies, lies, lies   I know that you have lied to me so don't even try to play now   You said you didn't do those type of things, but you went and did them anyway   Now there is nothing you can say to me   There is nothing you can do now   The awful truth is that you broke my heart   And now I'm going to break yours, too   You get what you pay for   You gotta own what you sell   I know I will forgive you when I give you   Just a taste of hell   A little flavor of the pain that you gave me   A little taste of hell   All that trouble you have put

day   (Hey Big Oil, what did you say?).Take the time to look around you   Look what's growing from the seed you sow   Take a look around you   By the fruits of their labor shall you know them      How much time do you waste talking   On and on about the good things you like to do   When all the good's in doing   By the fruits of their labor shall you know them      Without labor the grapes would never ripen on the vine   And never be pressed into wine   Make sure your harvest is taken safely inside   Don't let it wither and die      In the dark abyss of ignorance   It's impossible to make things grow   In the light of truth it's easy   By the fruits of their labor shall you know them   By the fruits of their labor shall you know them.The touch of her starlight makes me happy,   I can see her shinin' through in my dreams..We know the bow street runners,   But they don't know this tune,   So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio   We'll be back soon!.She was something very special to me   The kind of girl you'd like to see   In a movie or a rosary      She could be straight-laced or homespun   Or free and easy on the run   She could be meek and mild or full of fun      She liked country lanes and aeroplanes   And cigarettes would make her strange   And when she wanted you she made it plain      She would never say where she came from   It didn't seem that she had anyone   To answer to or dwell upon      She liked candlelight and good wine   And I would call her any time   Of day or night she didn't mind      The was nothing that I wouldn't do   To prove to her my love was true   And she gave to me a dream or two      There were times when she would never appear   For days and then she'd disappear   But now the days have turned to years      I was something she could use   Like a good friend or a pair of shoes   Or any kind of good news      Now the eastern sky is crimson and red   As I lie here in my lonely bed   And think about the things she said      She said darling there will come a day   When I must run far away   I will go my love and you must stay      She departed in the early spring   She didn't leave me anything   To follow or to find her      She was something very special to me   The kind of girl you'd like to see   In a movie or a rosary"
"My opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out. If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she sould go out side and get some fresh air and get some exrcise. Some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurder/kill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralized from lack of exercise or get lumf ophemia thats when your body a pears and will not be a to exercise and would need special treatments. Like masogise. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand eye coordination by useing the still looking sometimes some people for useing the computer: videos, video, and websites. You can get your computer uloaded for for quality. Some systems howe computers in them or can be connected to the computer like the, and the @CAPS1 @NUM1 @CAPS2. There are games called p.c. games some p.c. games comeucicate with childern to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also spiecal computers and/or web-sites you can search for tutorial for speaking different langueges. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instroments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptynis inside of them inistead of eating. Some people obeuse the compeuter as a dug like they're addictied to it. Imagine someone addictied to computers every where he/she goes they would take their laptop with them. Many people have died useing the computer but thats because they obeused it. Everyday people buy computers this invention is very helpful as time goes on sciantists are makeing new things to save llives..Reign of blows   Reign of blows   Reign of blows cascading down upon your shoulders   Far too many men dressed up as soldiers   The lamb is brought to the ground   Under the weight of the Crown   A crown of thorns and dark deeds   The swastika and the hammer and symbol   Are sickles that reap only weeds      Reign of blows   Reign of blows   Reign of blows precedes a storm of revolution   People have no place in their solution   So torture raises its head   Decked out in blue, white, and red   And iron maidens will slam   And by the half light of burning republics   Joe Stalin looks just like Uncle Sam      Reign of blows   Reign of blows   Reign of blows has washed away the corpse of Abel,   Cain is now the king in every Babel   I just don't care who you are   When death draws up in his car   And talks in terrorist tones   Remember violence is only a vote for the   Black Queen to take back the throne      Reign of blows.He said ''she is, she is but, yo   She crazy like in every single way   Like a hurricane www.eliterics.com   You gotta get out of the way   But she's hot, and she's cold   And she's cool and she's bold   And she's full of rage like me   And I like the game, yo""      Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous   Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo   Glamorous dangerous   Notorious but famous but I'm crazy      He's gonna hate me   He wants a real girl   I'm like a cartoon   All caught up in this fame game   Yo, good luck, good luck   He said ''we're through"".Tell me cuz it's blowing my mind   Tell me cuz I don't understand   How someone can just walk into your life   And everything before them you forget   Is it crazy?.No one I think is in my tree,   I mean it must be high or low..have never walked on water   Felt the waves beneath my feet   But at Your word Lord   I'll receive Your faith to walk on oceans deep      And I remember how You found me   In that very same place   All my failings surely would have drowned me   Still You made a way      [Chorus]   You are my freedom   Jesus You're the reason   I'm knelling again at your throne   Where would I be without You   Here in my life   Here in my life      You have said that all the heavens   Sing for joy at one who finds the   Way to freedom truth of Jesus   Brought from death into this life      And I remember how You saw me   Through the eyes of Your grace   And though the price was Your beloved for me   Still You made a way      [Chorus: x 2]      (Chorus being sung in the background repeatedly)      [Chorus: x 2].When the sun crashes into your world   Look around and you try and find your girl   And you're daring, too sick of what you see   Out of town is the only place to be      When your life starts to run out of juice   Feel like dyin' and you just want to get loose   Prayin' moves don't make much sense to you   Seeing red before your feeling is blue      Last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn      Going back, getting out of this town   Stretch it lean and mean, it turns you around   Take your dreams and stretch them out on the street   Take your turn to get back on your feet      Feel the wheels singin' over the ridge   Feel the song like ""Oakland"" take you   All the time you knew you had the itch   All the girls were glad to see you      Last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn      Girl in ol' ""V"" won't pray   Don't give you a hard time   All the girls from Brooklyn say   Last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn      Do you remember the day you left the block   Your mama said you would live to regret it   Coming home, coming stoned, come in hope, coming ready   Are you holding steady      Last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn.[Rihanna]   Come in to me...

"Wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life. I would, we need computer for many things, for example we need computer for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. Next this is good for buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @MONTH1 have missed as if you was absent. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @MONTH1 be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Now a days many college students with work going on @MONTH1 not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. With computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @CAPS1 from the I have told you like communications, education, and buying and selling products I hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society.I met her last night   I saw her move   She took my eye   I had to prove   That I was cool and she was hot   I'll tell you what she wore but I forgot   I had the guts to walk her way   She didn't move   I didn't stray   I have one chance and this is it   But then I fell right on her left tit      I'm just a kid on a branch   I wish you'd come up and dance   I want a little romance   Could you please give me a chance   I'm probably last on the list   But all I want is this wish to come true   If it's you then I'll be down for that, too      I saw her next week   In frozen foods   I sized her up   She had the goods   I tried to walk by with cool reserve   She probably thinks that I'm a perv   And as I rode by in my squeaky cart   It occurred to me the supermart   Is not the best place to get a date   Maybe at the roller-rink is where I'll find my soul mate      I'm just a kid on a branch   I wish you'd come up and dance   I want a little romance   Could you please give me a chance   I'm probably last on the list   But all I want is this wish to come true   If it's you then I'll be down for that, too      It's ok cause Counselor Troy tells me   That my self-esteem is high   He held me close and tried to tell me   That I'm not like the other

"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on peoples' lives. You can do alot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convinient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see @LOCATION1, you can go online to learn @CAPS1 language. You can also study food s that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can daunloads and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure that let you explore new lands. And in alot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are otherways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, facebook, twitter, and video chat. With any of these things you can talks to friends or family around the world or in your state/country. All of these you can either download, go on the internet for, or buy them. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you havent seen in a while. Video chat you can see eacho ther, face book you can share pictures and chat rooms you can talk with multiple people. In conclusion computers are very convinient for our society today. Whether it's studying the world, having fun, or talking to people you know, the computer has many wonderous things for people.You're sure to fall in love, in love, in love..They say they like it, now, but in the market it   May not go well as it's too laid back..Dog, for the, for two and a half maybe three years before that, in New   York, I was drivin dirty, my license was no good..I love the sound of smashing guitars   I love the sound of crashing guitars   Red guitars against the wall   Big guitars can turn so small   I love the sound of crashing guitars   Show it!.Ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly, ly ly ly, ly ly ly..This is the way I want to do it whether you like it or not   This is the way I gotta tell you and I ain't gonna stop   We're in a sticky situation and you really don't mind.Soul survivor   World survivor   I just wanna let it go   World survivor, soul survivor   Just wanna let it go      Jesus please on my knees can't you hear my crying   You said to put it in your hands and lord I'm really trying   You wasn't lying when you said you'd reap what you sow   Like that night mama died   Hard to let it go   You adopted me   Cared for me   And changed my name   But I cursed at you   Lied to you   Left your pain   It's not strange I can still see it in my head   To know for hours you were laying in that bed   If you listening to this record,   If it's day our night   If my mama still living treat your mama right   Don't be like me and let that moment slip away   And be careful cause you can't take back what you say   To my real mama if you listening I'm letting it go   To my father I forgive you 'cause you didn't know   The pain was preparation for my destiny   And one more thing lord let my son be a better man than me.the government's the drug dealers   Before I let this police kid harass me   This rookie ass cop gon' have to blast me   He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed   He made a move and I heard a blast   That's what you get, bitch      Bang bang   I shot you down, bang bang   You hit the ground, bang bang   That awefull sound, bang bang   I used to shoot you down      Now all the gangsta's pray   Lord, forgive me   But he tried to kill me   Somebody out there gotta feel me   Lord, forgive me   But he tried to kill me   Somebody out there gotta feel me      It's goin down around here nigga   Get ya muthafuckin head bust   Them muthafuckin street lights go out   And them real niggas come out   All the bitch niggas go in the house   Just not a game, man   Don't fuck around and lose your brain   And hey, all my real niggas pray      Lord, forgive me   But he tried to kill me   Somebody out there gotta feel me   Lord, forgive me   But he tried to kill me   Somebody out there gotta feel me      Lord, forgive me   But he tried to kill me   Somebody out there gotta feel me   Lord, forgive me   But he tried to kill me   Somebody out there gotta feel me.She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard   All you wanna know is (where my money at?).You're in control   Is there anywhere you want to go?.So I think you are a fool   Hanging on my every word   It's getting ugly   So I'm ugly      Tear me from your heart   Tearing me apart      So I thought you disappeared   Being alone is what you fear   Are you lonely?......

"The computer is able to do so many things. It think computers have posotive effects on people. But some experts believe they don’t which is why I'm writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. Computers believe it they help us in life wether @CAPS1 to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @DATE1, @CAPS1 one of the most important devices. Let me share my expierence okay. I had a job interview right well I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview. Thats why I think computers have posotive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. Well I have some people spend to much time on their computer @CAPS1 completely choice. And those are people who usually don't have alot of self control. And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. So in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important..( in these crazy times,   How very sweet to know,   Our love is like the love of long ago ..I need you more then I've ever needed someone..Holding back all my trouble   That accumulated over time   And now I can't seem to define   You and I were like brothers   We stuck together in hard times   But now it all seems to decline   I've written....Don't take them off until I say so..Then I woke up, then I woke up,   Then I woke up just now,   Just now I woke up,   I woke up just now..You're like fireworks and it's the fourth of July..You know I wait for you   If it takes a lifetime to do   Girl I will wait for you   You're the only thing worth holding on to   No matter how far   Girl I can't live without my heart   I hope you come home soon, soon   Girl I will wait for you   If it takes a lifetime to do   Girl I wait   Wait wait wait for you oh      Our phone calls will have to do   Write you letters just to prove   You're the only thing on my mind   I'm going...

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. But why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer. I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. Sure enough he was!

"Dear whom it @CAPS1, Have you ever wondered what it be like to spend all your time in front of computers? Well, if you are, I believe that should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom says only an hour aa day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and (or) play over a friends house. Yes, playing on computer is fun, but you have to execise to. (you know) @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors. Like that's how I met trees, animals, beautiful senery. You could feel like you were having the time or your. The last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use. you could make snowmen in the winter or if it's raining you could watch a movie. you could build a lot. In conclusion building, playing and jumping (the list could go on) You can enjoy the outdoors. Just rember the three good reason why are you could use the wonderful and lovly outdoors. Go walk you dog, have friends ober or even just having out with your family and friends..Don't let one mistake keep us apart..I'll find you..The day you said goodbye....... Yah.....   Let's not even bother be talking about   It doesn't really matter to you   So get it on....... Baby   Get it on....... Baby.... Ohhow   A secret's something that you keep   And a heart is something you hold on to   But you play by your own rules   And one day it will blow up in your face   So you cry... Ohyah.....Growing old is getting old   I often find myself here thinking   About the birds, the boats, and past loves that flew away or started sinking   And it's crazy here without you   I used to think this all was ours   We'd stay up late, debate on how we'd find our way   Say it's all up in the stars      Some nights I rule the world   With bar lights and pretty girls   But most nights I stay straight and think about my mom   Oh god, I miss her so much      And there are people on the street   They're coming up to me   They're telling me that they like what I do now   And so I tried my best when I took the fall   To get right back up, back in your arms   If you're out here why do I miss you so much      I feel like I had it all   Back before I lost it all   Now I just wait for you to talk to me   But you won't even look at me, baby      And I'd be saying that you   You're always holding on to stars   I think they're better from afar   Cause no one is gonna save us      Oh, and me   Well, I have faded in the dark   So don't you ever kiss me   Don't you wish on me   Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?.[Musical Interlude]      I'm free and ready so we can go steady   How's about saving all your time for me   No more lookin' I know I been cookin'   How's about keepin' steady company?.Is it any wonder   I'm cryin' in the sun?.'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop..I lay cradle bound   A howlin' out my mind   Not knowin' years to come   I'd be shoutin' over din      I sucked information through the holes in my skull   As my belly gurgles hungry my mouth is always full..People,      Let me tell you 'bout a place I know, to get in it don't take much dough..Ever since she went away   I hate California      Maybe she's livin' in a commune   Dancin' with Hippies under the moon   It's all free love, weed and patchouli   And there's a guru named Visuli   And he's doin' her for sure      Maybe she's scummin' some big rap star   Drinkin' pink Cosmos at the Sky Bar   Those Hollyweirdos with their tofu, avocado   I bet she think she won the lotto good for her      She's lovin' Californ-I-a   She loves the beach   She loves to party everyday   Pina Coladas on the sidewalk in L.A..Lord, now you've heard my story, now you've heard my news..Here we are in the years   Where the showman shifts the gears   Lives become careers   Children cry in fear   Let us out of here!.Good morning..Everybody's gone away said they're moving to LA   There's not a soul I know around everybody's leavin' town   Some caught a freight some caught a plane find the

find a thing to ease the rain   I'd love to try and settle down but everybody's leavin' town   Some gotta win some gotta lose good time Charlie's got the blues   Good time Charlie's got the blues.Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap..And when the world is closing in   You come save me once again..White cups and coffee, lord yea   Its all that he needs   And he's all right by me

cross the line   You must be the angel, I though I might never find   Was it you I heard singing, oh, while I was chasin' dreams   Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around   And the rain fallin' down but I never know   Got to be heaven 'cause here's where the rainbow ends   If this ain't the real thing, then it's close enough to pretend   When that wind blows when the night's about to fall   You can hear the silence call, it's a certain sort of sound   Like the rain fallin' down   Hole's in what's left of my reason, hole's in the knees of my blues   Odds against me been increasin' but I'll pull through   I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do   But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine   I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose   Never know now, just don't never know, no   Well it's been heaven but even the rainbows will end   Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'   And I'm as good as gone again   I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance   Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance   And the rain fallin' down, well, you never know, just don't know   Listen, sure don't know what I going for, but I'm gonna go for it for sure"
"I agree that we shold have computers, because more and more people use computers. Long time ago we don't even have computers, but now we do. Now we have computers we should use it. If we don’t use computers why we even have computers? Computers can help you to learn faraway places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and other faraway places. If we don't know what is going on faraway places then we don't know what kind flag they have and what do they eat, what do they have, are what they do, and what do they speak. You can even talking online with your friends on computer! You dont have to call you friend, you can just talk to you frien on online, if you need help with your homework are you left your math text book at school you frient can tell you the questions by talking online. If your friend is in @LOCATION2 are other faraway places your friend can bring there computer with him or her so your friend can just talking to you by talking online, you dont have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other places. You can also learn how to type, when you know how to type you can type faster and faster. You can type storys, poem, and notes are something you have to do at school, so you don't have to write on a pace of peaper you can just type on computer. That is why we should have computers and use more.

"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people..It's hard to be a snail   Who

nothing I can't do,   So hold on, baby, I'm coming straight on through..I, I've been in love before   I thought I would no more   Manage to hit the ceiling   Still, strange as it seems to me   You brought it back to me   That old feeling      I, I don't know what you do   You make me think that you   Possibly could release me   I think you'll be able to   Make all my dreams come true   And you ease me      You thrill me, you delight me   You please me, you excite me   You're something I'd been pleading for   I love you, I adore you   I lay my life before you   I'll have you want me more and more   And finally it seems my lonely days are through   I've been waiting for you      I, I'm gonna make you mine   You're gonna feel so fine   You'll never want to leave me   I feel you belong to me   Someday you will agree   Please, believe me      You thrill me, you delight me   You please me, you excite me   You're something I'd been pleading for   I love you, I adore you   I lay my life before you   I'll have you want me more and more   And finally it seems my lonely days are through   I've been waiting for you   Oh, I've been waiting for you.If I listened long enough to you   I'd find a way to believe that it's all true   Knowing that you lied, straight-faced, while I cried   Still I'd look to find a reason to believe      Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else   Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think of myself      If I gave you time to change my mind   I'd find a way to leave the past behind   Knowing that you lied, straight-faced, while I cried   Still I'd look to find a reason to believe      [Chorus]   Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else   Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think of myself   Someone like you makes it hard to think about somebody else      If I listened long enough to you   I'd find a way to believe that it's all true   I'd find a reason, a reason to believe (oh no)   And though I want you, you're just not what I need      [Chorus]   Someone like you, like you   I'd find a reason to believe   I would find a reason to believe.It's a tale of the fool   Designed to weaken you   Full of sound and fury   And jealous lies   It tries-but I'm free!.When I'm on the road playin' in a town without a name   And I'm feelin' low everybody looks the same   Well, you catch my eye and then you come on strong   An' try to make your play   Just because we love tonight   Please, don't you think it's gonna stay that way      Don't you know that you're nothin' more than a one night stand?.I like it here - can I stay?.If the sun would lose its light   And we lived an endless night   And there was nothing left that you could feel   That's how it would be   What my life would seem to me   If I didn't have your love to make it real      If the stars were all unpinned   And a cold and bitter wind   Swallowed up the world without a trace   Ah, well that's where I would be   What my life would seem to me   If I couldn't lift the veil and see your face   And if no leaves were on the tree   And no water in the sea   And the break of day had nothing to reveal   That's how broken I would be   What my life would seem to me   If I didn't have your love to make it real   If the sun would lose its light   And we lived in an endless night   And there was nothing left that you could feel   If the sea were sand alone   And the flowers made of stone   And no one that you hurt could ever heal   Well that's how broken I would be   What my life would seem to me   If I didn't have your love to make it real"
"@CAPS1 you want people to be over weight? @CAPS1 you wat our beautifal out doors to be ruined? And @CAPS1 you want familys to be distant because they are to pre @CAPS2? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of familys dont talk because they are to preocupied with computar games. The issue to grapple with is @CAPS1 computars have an affect on people. Yes, I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enought exersize, they dont enjoy the nature that we have, and they dont inter act with there family and friends. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enough exersize. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight spend more time on the computar than on the track. I remember a time when I was over weight be cause I spent to much time on the computar. One day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and I had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize. @CAPS1 you want kids to be over weight like I was? Many people dont get to enjoy the great out doors because they are to preocupied with the computar. Lisa, a volentere worker in @LOCATION1, says ""This feild used to be a vast array of plants and animal life, but now it is a waste land because of computars. No one had the time to worry of the natural wonder because they were to @CAPS2 with there computar animated jobs and didnt care what came of it. @CAPS1 you want this to happen to our country? @PERCENT4 of high technological places are dirty with very little plant life because the workers need to tend to the computars rather than the bushes. Some familys have a hard time talking about their dayly lifes becuse they spendin to much time on the computar and dont spend the time to talk and get to know each other. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 ofdevorces are related to not being able to have aconversation and with more technoligy on the way that number will grow. I remember that my parents got devorced because my dad spent more time on the computar than talking to me or my mom. Most people think that computars are good for research. Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house insted of in a big library with all the information you need. I think that computars have a negitive impact on people..I'm alive   'Cause Jesus gave me life   He opened up my eyes   I can see clearly now      Oh, everybody dance now, oh      Everybody, give it

"I agree with the computers helping people. To start with, computers have a possitive affect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Also it allows people to talk online from far away places. So, yes, computers are good for people. First of all, computers do have a possitive affect. The computer @MONTH1 give some one motivation. Or it will help someone find their lost pet. Also it could help you get a job. Plus you can find a safe home with it. So, ya computers do have a possitive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. Also you can get information on places you will visit. This will help learn about diffrent contrays. Most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. This concluds that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for familys. Also people who have hospitilized family. Plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a possitive affect on people. They given us ability to learn! Lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away.

"Dear State legistator, @CAPS1 you live back a long time ago when there were no computers. The only diffrence now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder. I deffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone elses lifes easier. With the computer it teaches hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I belive the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from “@CAPS2 drivers.com” the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decraced over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like “@CAPS3” a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pa. the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in “@CAPS4-tech” magazine. I should also add in it has reconected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online.

"Computers can take a lot of a person's time, but there are also benefits to having one. You could gain loads of knowledge and make interaction with others easier with a click of the cursor. The computer is the smartest thing youll ever see. All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your facebook, twitter, or myspace and tell them your running late. It's @DATE1, no one writes letters anymore; there's e-mail and instant messaging.

"Computers are great technology, but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives! Computers cause children to fail and lose their exercize. The children also put their self in danger by joining a few different websites. Don’t waste your time in a boring computer screen! I am almost @PERCENT1 positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their back packs in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. My mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @CAPS1, when he would only go one @NUM1 minutes a day to talk to family members. Now, my mom created a @CAPS1, that @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was gona only go on to with the family, but @CAPS2 plays all the pointless applications, such as, ""cafe world."" @CAPS2 waste her time on @CAPS1 whenever @CAPS2 is home, when @CAPS2 could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. Something I havent mentioned is, I use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didnt go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I relized after I got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. My dad then disconected my @CAPS4, and I beleive my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconecting the @CAPS4, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @CAPS3 home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, ""blogtv.com."" were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing! Stop wasting your life people! Go out and have fun, dont let the @CAPS4 keep you home. The @CAPS4 is unsafe and pointless..Plang in noapte strunele,   Strunele nebunele   Tu, iubire, spune-le   Ce-a fost nu s-a pierdut!.I've been anointed, been appointed   Even been magnified   Spied a chapel all of gold   The priest was laying down with the swine      How can a poor boy get a little message to you?.I noticed that you touched my soul in time   And lied to stop my leaving   For a place where no one hears..Sounds like - love, (laughing) life's sweetest reward   It's an open sword      (Toca: sword?).Open yourself let me inside   Open your arms   I have nowhere to go   So let me into you   I need to be where nothing can hurt me   Open your legs   To let me crawl   Inside of you   I need to be inside your womb   So take me home   Inside of you   Envelope me I'm home      Bringing me down   Bringing me down   I want to be your baby   Bringing me down   Bringing me down   Bringing me down   I want to be your baby   Bringing me down      Open your legs   And take me in   I need to be inside within   Let me become a part of you   Let me inside of you   Swallow me whole   I want to know the things you hide   I want to feel the things you feel   I want to breath the air you breath   I want to live inside of you      Take me   Bringing me down   Bringing me down   I want to be your baby   Bringing me down   Bringing me down   Bringing me down   I want to be your baby   Bringing me down   Let me live inside   Let me live inside   Let me live inside   Let me live inside.They're takin' your bill of rights away from you."".One crown   Shines on through the sound   One crown   Born to lose   One man   Does not give a damn   One man   No excuse      Aces wild   Aces high   All the aces   Aces 'til you die      White lines fading   The iron horse rolls on and on and on      Hear your thunder   Still feeding back   Still hear your thunder   The man in black   Born to lose   Living to win      One fist   Hammers through the mist   One fist   Steady on   One heart   Diehard from the start   One heart   Beats its song      Murder all   Murder one   Give me murder   Second class to none      Headlights fading   The iron horse rolls on and on and on      Hear your thunder   Still feeding back   Still hear your thunder   The man in black   Born to lose   Living to win      Hear your thunder   Still feeding back   I still hear your thunder   The man in black   Born to lose   No excuse      'Til the end   Been living to win   Been living to win.Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true....I always thought that I could make it on my own..And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise all right..When it's overwhelming   When you can't get past it, yeah   You still won't know what it's like   What it's like      You haven't seen the ghosts that I've seen   You haven't lived enough to know what it means   To feel the?.(Oh) lean on me      If (if)   There is a load!.Come on, one, two, three, four - i'll jump right up and do the bump(?.(Running, running, running...).If you'll just stay to keep me hidden from the day,      And all its light,   That's covered up by night when you're away..I'll believe the sun is going up,   Even though it's going down..When I look into your eyes   It's like watching the night sky   Or a beautiful sunrise   But there's so much they hold   And just like them old stars   I see that you've come so far   To be right where you are   How old is your soul?.I love you, ooh..[1832..Could you be love me."
"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 your computer daily can be a waste of your life. Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercsing and enjoying nature, distract you from human nature things such as communicating, and can also waste tons of energy. Picture yourself, sitting at your desk, talking to some friends online. Take away your computer and all youre doing is sitting thhere, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, [expect your fingers of ] @CAPS2't you think you should be doing something more usefull in your life? Such as taking a walk and enjoying nature? That's what I thought. Nature is beautiful. So @CAPS4 enjoy it throug h a window next to your desk? obesity is a problem in @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are considered ""fat"" @CAPS4 would you even think about spending your day simply sitting in a chair? Go to the gym and loose some of that extra body weight! Communicating through @CAPS5's is so over-rated, people can't express their emotions! all they can do is send a smily face or happy face. Communication wih only your friends can cause you to miss out on things. For example, lets say there is a cancelation at your work place on the news, but you @CAPS2't see it cause you were @CAPS6-ing with your friend. @CAPS6? @PERCENT2 of people @CAPS2't even ""laugh out loud"" @CAPS7 they send that to their friends. Plus you @MONTH1 even go to your friends, house and instead of laughing, you'l say @CAPS6. Are instead of gasping, you say, ""@CAPS9!"" I mean come on people, get out and really ""communicate"" @CAPS10, so you bought one of those new lights? Too bad youre not even saving any energy by @CAPS1 that computer of yours daily. @CAPS1 that @CAPS11, uses about the same amount of energy in as @NUM1 regular light bulbs in @NUM2 hours, @CAPS12 that light really saving you that much money. Haven't you heard? the economy is bad, which means we @CAPS2't have alot of money which means YOU playing online games is wasting energy, which is wasting money. Someones going to have to work overtime this week, and it's not me. I @CAPS2't think hair spray is the cause of the layer being destroyed... Computers are bad, and dont have a good enough reason to be used. They take enjoying nature, reduse your communication levels, and not to mention, waste a lot of energy. Therefore, my point is made..Whale' ya' mean life?.I said hey joe, hey joe,   Where you goin' with that gun in your hand,   I said hey joe,   Where you goin' with that gun in your hand   I caught her messin' round, gonna messin' round town with another man yeah   I said hey joe, hey joe   Where you goin' with that gun in your hand   Hey joe, hey joe, where you goin' , haha-haha-haha   I've caught

"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy a lot of people's time which could be used for other matters. The internet also contains alot of unappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many petafiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in america is climbing. There is no doubt that electronics, play a huge role in this event. For example my brother plays on the computer everyday, so barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also there is alot of content. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornagraphy. most sites don't even alert you that by how you need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very little acctually ask for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children as a young teens. Its truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and. Petafiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive, to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location, and to commit rape. Some victims are enough speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet. For these reasons I say that computers have a negative effect computers lives because some positive but sadly cons outweight pros such as before mention occupation of time, content on the internet. I truly believe that the planet would be better with out computers..My baby I love you so much forever you and I   I love you oh I love you so much forever you and I   My baby I love you so much

"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 are worried that people are on the computer way to much and don't spend enough time outside enjoying nature or exercising. I wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer. First, kids and even adults can talk to there friends online. Your popley thinking that the kids already some there friend at school but what @CAPS2 their moved. They could have moved to a different city, State or even cuntry and the only @MONTH1 to connect with them is by They can't call each other @CAPS2 they really far away that would be a pretty phone bill. Seventy five percent of people talk to thier friends through computer. About half of the people are talking to friends who live in another state. or country. Do you really want people to lose their friends? Next, people can actually make new friends in the computer, like pen pals. Pen pals are people you write to but they don't live in the state as you or sometimes not even the same country. assignment at school but you can do it on your @CAPS2 your pen pal doesn't live in the same country as you and doesn't speak fluend @CAPS3 you can teach them @CAPS3 and they can teach you these language. Finally, there's away for kids to go on the You could a limit on thier computer time Some wants to paly a game on the ""@CAPS5 you can play on the computer away from her the next day. @CAPS2 wants to go on the computer that day and throws a ten turn the parent should take the computer away for the next and so on and so on. Once your child finally cooperates they will get the to use the computer. As you can see there are meny things to do on the computer from talking to far away friends to making new friends a computer schedule. Thank you for taking you time to read this letter..Broken, the seems burst in a rush   A cataclysmic horror story pens its' lust   Collision makes a call to change a certain path   Full disbelief takes its hold   Delay the wrath   Delay wrath      This is for the lost   This is for the fallen   You will remain in my world until I rest      This unrelenting test   The sting of memories   Has chased the shadow dark   To chase them long enough   Would end in certain death   No longer solid ground   Now grayed the autumn leaf   A barren road      Upon the pages of our path   Bringing great calamity   Contagious this loss will surely ruin   There's great calamity ahead      This is for the lost   This is for the fallen   For you'll remain in my world until I rest      Until I rest   You will remain.(D. Del, M. Wilkins)      She walks these hills in a long black veil   She visits my grave when the night winds wail   Nobody knows, nobody sees   Nobody knows but me         Ten years ago, on a cold dark night   Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light   There were few at the scene, but they all agreed   That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me         The judge he said: Son, what is your alibi   If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die   But I spoke not a word though it meant my life   For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife         Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near   She stood in the crowd but she'd not a tear   But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan   In a long black veil she cries on my bones.Highways take me over the mountains....There was fans from Ballyfermot, Ballybough and Ballymun   On the journey of a lifetime, and the crack was ninety-one   Joxer met a German's daughter on the banks of the river Rhine   And he told her she'd be welcome in Ballyfermot any time..Take my advice, don't move!.All these posers keep you awake   I guess I'm just too tired to sleep   And God only knows I'm too lost to cry   Kissing last has kept me true   I'll fall (hold me tight)   But I'll leave (hold me tight)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely      I'll fall (hold me tight)   But I'll leave (hold me tight)   So hold me tight   Cause I'm so lonely      He hates so much it's love he says   Inside his dark I need to smile   He shouts so loud I never hear   That's why the truths always abused      As I slip into unconsciousness   I never felt so much to blame   I'll fall (hold me tight)   But I'll leave (hold me tight)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely      I'll fall (hold me tight)   But I'll leave (hold me tight)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely      As I slip into unconsciousness   I never felt so much to blame   I'll fall (hold me tight)   But I'll leave (hold me tight)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely      I'll fall (hold me tight)   But I'll leave (hold me tight)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely      I'll fall (hold me tight)   But I'll leave (hold me tight)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely      I'll fall (hold me tight)   But I'll leave (hold me tight)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely      I'll fall (another day another night)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely      I'll fall (another day another night)   So hold me tight   'Cause I'm so lonely.What am I gonna do when the sun goes down   And all the lights are low,   What am I gonna do when I

"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren't even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, ""where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment..It's better if it's worse than before..I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose..Oh, I've got no use for your master plan,   No one's running this life but me..They say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice   I say the blacker the rims the sweeter the coupe (Whoo!).Back to life, back to sense,   Back to child, back to husband,   No one lives in the woods,   There are vows, there are ties,   There are needs, there are standards,   There are shouldn'ts and shoulds..Girl no need to be nervous,   'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,   Just go with it, go with it, go with it   And I will go real slow with it, slow with it   It's our first time   Go with it, go with it, go with it   And I will go real slow with it, slow with it   It's our first time      Clothes are not required, for what we got planned   Ooh, girl your my desire, your wish is my command   Treat you like a princess, ooh girl your so delicious   Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away, yeah      Oh babe, Is that alright?.Say Goodbye   A bond will make another try   Don't be sorry if you cry   I'll be crying too      All this day...      [Chorus]   All This time   All and all I've no regrets   The sun still shines the sun still sets   And the heart forgives, the heart forgets   Oh what will I do now with all this time?.There's a thousand words that I could say   To make you come home   Oh, seems so long ago you walked away   Left me alone   I remember what you said to me   You were acting so strange   and maybe I was too blind to see   That you needed a change      Was it something I said   To make you turn away?.I want you right here next to me,   So tell me we can spend some time..The god of love preparing to depart..Night after night, night after night..[Intro]   My body and my mind with you   That's all over now   Did what I had to do   Cause it's so far past me now   Share my body and my life with you   That's way over now   There's not more I can do   You're so famous now      [Verse 1]   Got your bible   Got your gun   And you like to party   And have fun   And I like my candy   And your women   I'm finally happy   Now that you're gone      [Pre-Chorus]   Got my little red party dress on   Everybody knows that I'm the best   I'm crazy, yeah yeah   Get a little bit of Bourbon in ya   Get a little bit suburban and go crazy, yeah yeah      [Chorus]   Because you're young, you're wild, you're free,   You're dancing circles around me,   You're fucking crazy,   Ooh, ooh, you're crazy for me..Ok by me..Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day..I'll take some of this, I'll have some of that   And several more of these   Now that I see it, I know what I like   So I'll like it if you please   I ain't nobody's princess, stuck in Sunday School   So I'll help myself to love   And have the whole career   Don't wrap it up, I'll eat it here      Just look at you now, the ultimate guy   Class and wit and style   Once I might have pretended, to be someone else   Attracting you with guile   But now I'm not about to dress up, in some other woman's shoes   I've got nothing to lose   So I'll help myself to love,   Gather round and cheer   Don't wrap it up, I'll eat it here      I've stood there patiently waiting in line   A take-out man's an O.K..He's the well kept secret of the underground   He's in debt to the company store   Because his only channeled aspiration   Was getting back that girl he had before   He's got stacks and stacks of words that rhyme   Describing what it is to lose   He's got some just for laughs, he's got some for love   That mainline to his blues   Some to shed a little light   On you and on me   Some to shed a little light   On a human story   The wars of pride and property   The rebel Irish and the promised land Jew   Fighting behind his eyes and over seas   Wounded in action and no ceasefire in view   Brave reporters bring the battles home   But tonight inside that box   Just more bang-bang ketchup color to him   Just more Twentieth Century Fox   All because that ghostly girl comes haunting   Just out of reach outside his bed   She kicks the covers off of his sleep   For the clumsy things he said   She commands his head   She tries his sanity   She demands his head   Tonight unknowingly   Vaguely she floats and lacelike   Blown in like a curtain on the night wind   She's nebulous and naked   He wonders where she's been   He grabs at the air because there's nothing there   Her evasiveness stings him now   With long legs, long lonely legs   Bruised from banging into things   One day he was standing just outside her door   He was carrying an armload of bright balloons   She just laughed   She said she heard him knocking   And she teased him for the moon   ""Is one the moon, dear clown   Tied to a string for me?"".Well come on and tell us Johnny   What's the secret of success   You gotta take a tip from the king of hip   Cuase you know that he's the best      We're going prowlin, we're going prowlin tonight   I see you hungry for a lover   Gotta find a chick who'll give you more   Well, there's a spot that I've discovered   Where a guys guaranteed to score      I'm gonna show you cats some action   like you've never seen before   We're gonna get some satisfaction   Down at the Grocery Store      we're goin prowlin (Walk, talk like T-Birds)   Prowlin (Walk, talk like T-Birds)   Prowowowlin tonight      There's a female butcher at the luncheon meat display   Got the best tongue in town, she delivers night and day   See the apple of your eye, stackin peaches in a five foot pile   Just waitin on some guy to come and take her rollin down the aisle      (Spoken)   Louis: Well, I like a debutante, who comes across-- now that's what I call class   Davey: Well, I like a tall girl with long legs that go right up to her.........[Verse]   Lost in the mirror   I knew your face once, but now it's unclear   And I can't feel my body now   I'm separate from here and now   A drug and a drink   We lost connection, oh come back to me   So I can feel alive again   Soul and body try to mend      [Chorus]   It's pulling me apart, this time   Everything is never ending   Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand   This feeling always gets away   Wishing I could hold on longer   It doesn't have to feel so strange   To be in love again   To be in love again   To be in love again      [Verse]   Lost in the mirror   I knew your face once, but now it's unclear   And I can't feel my body now   I'm separate from here and now      [Chorus]   It's pulling me apart, this time   Everything is never ending   Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand   This feeling always gets away   Wishing I could hold on longer   It doesn't have to feel so strange   To be in love again   To be in love again   To be in love again.There's money in them war machines, now ain't this a bitch?.You'd better run..And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach   That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep."
"Computers, a @LOCATION1 topic if you ask me. Sure they arnt very good for you dosn't mean if you use it correctly then it can be a souce of life. Computers are helpful in many ways, they can be an information post. The social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world. During school kids have projects and without computers. Read on as I will explain in details. Computers, as you know, are one of the worlds greatest information posts. @NUM1 out of ten people survayed said that the computers are a value of everyday life, The earthquake in haiti is recovalng now, but half the world wouldnt know that with out computers so have a heart, and dont take away the most valued info in the world. Secondly, what would you say if I told, you that kids are more socialy retarded than ever! Well its true. Over @NUM2 of the worlds people rely on intractive websites to comunicate with each other. Fact, children have more friends over the internet then ever. You dont want to be the @LOCATION1 in all this do yours ar know as the person who kept kids from living? I dont think so. Lastly, all people in school use computers to do projects, for instance @PERSON2 had horrible hand writing and this was the bigest project of the year. So he turned his computer to type it, he gets on at. But what if there was (@CAPS1) computer! @PERSON2 would have gotten a @CAPS2 - for the project. In fact teachers @CAPS3 wear tell kids to type hw/projects. @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 year kids pass my class by typing and if they then they would all flunk!"" @CAPS4 got the point but more importantly do you?! To sumit all up for those of you lazy enough to not read there story essay. Computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information. Makeing friends, or doing projects. So are you gonna be the person who sits back and lets that happen or are you going to get up and stop the maddness once and for all. Its you choice but think of the socity retarded, dumb kids that fail the grade @CAPS3 year..Freedom or big chains, they don't feel my pain      Blood on my sneakers, no remorse for the grievers   He played the corner like Revis he should've had better defense   That's how I'm feelin', blood spillin' I love killin'   Niggas'll swear that they it, this is as rare as it gets   Rap game changed, this is embarrassing shit   Bunch of bitches posin' on some old Miss America shit   I was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit, moving careless as shit   In a city where niggas really don't care who they hit   Who the fuck was I?.Are you really exclusive or just miserly?.[Chorus]   I don't want feel so different,   But I don't want to be insignificant   And I don't how to see the same things different now..Remember how we used to love, baby   Love like it was everything?.Are we rolling?.I've got fourteen miles to go,   I've got rhythm comin' sense I've got the sto..Another girl I don't dare to confide in   Playing that role it hurts inside   Here I am thinking she wants me   She only wants that killer on her CD   Just when I couldn't feel any worse   Bitch asked me if I could paint my face first   The day I finally get to leave this land   Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man   Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man   The shell of a used up man   The shell of a used up man   Behind the paint will be the shell of a used up man (Analyze!).There's nothing I wouldn't do   To have just one more chance   To look into your eyes and see you looking back      I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do   And I've hurt myself      If I had just one more day, I would tell you how much that   I've missed you since you've been away      Oh, it's dangerous   It's so out of line to try to turn back time      I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do   And I've hurt myself      By hurting you.She loved the biker like an icon   Gazing at his picture everyday..The fastest, highest,   Steepest, and tallest coaster-ride ever to exist on this or any other planet!.Curtains of back were inside the room   Shutting out the light, the light that always hurt his eyes   There was nothing bright in this entire mansion... no, no   Except for the candlelight... the light... and the fire that burned real slow      Oh Miriam... why did you have to go and die?.All night long   It works for me..Doodlin', can you doodle?.Is there anyone that sees what's going one?.I find myself speechless   This feeling of completeness is so strong   And now as convinced that my heart had reached it's limit   Till you created this new place in it      Your touch wraps around   In love that knows no boundaries   Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you   You're the answer I've been needing   Life doesn't hold no meaning   Now... All because of you      Everything is different,   There's no frame of reference for the way I feel   Would you look at your face   I'm still amazed, I can't believe you're real   I can lie here forever just watching you sleep   Hanging on every breath that you breathe      Your touch wraps around   In love that knows no boundaries   Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you   You're the answer I've been needing   Life doesn't hold no meaning   Now... All because of you      All Because Of You...   Mmmmmm.Ho ho ha haaaa!.Back to the basics,   When you're not wasted,   I know you'll see..Aee Yeah!.No stranger am I   You enter my world   I hear flowers sing   No emptiness now   You enter my world   Hear flowers with me   Sing joyous      I feel you 'er I sing   No unending time alone      No stranger am I   You open my eyes   I feel laughter ring   No longer alone   You open my heart   Feel laughter with me   Ring joyous      Indifference gone away   No unending time alone      Indifference gone away   No undening time alone.By the time I realized what I had done I was already dead..Well I know that I'm no angel, can say my first time out."
"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. .San Francisco's fine,   You sure get lots of sun..You tell me where!.But gigolo and gigolette   Still sing a song and dance along   The boulevard of broken dreams..I'm bringing me down [x3]   I'm bringing me...down      You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place)   We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way)   We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe)   We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace) [x2].Oh my girl you feel so good..Thing-fish:   Yow!.You'd better tell   Your story fast...   And if you lie   It will come to pass...      Tell me!.You say either   And I say either   You say neither   And I say neither   Either, either, neither, neither   Let's call the whole thing off      You like potatoes   And I like potatoes   You like tomatoes   And I like tomatoes   Potatoes, potatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes   Let's call the whole thing off      But oh, if we call the whole thing off   Then we must part   And oh, if we ever part   Then that might break my heart      So it you like pajarnas and I like pajamas   I'll wear pajamas and give up pajamas   For we know we need each other   So we'd better call the calling off, off   Let's call the whole thing off      So if you go for oysters   And I go for oysters   I'll order oysters and cancel the oysters   For we know we need each other   So we'd better call the calling off, off   Let's call the whole thing off.You can count on me..Already home   All this feeling here inside   One word ain't enough   The way to say it seems to hide   How can I say love?.I'm gonna try my best to hold you baby,   Hold you in my arms..I want your body..[Verse 3:]   When I cannot seem to love again   And the raindrops won't ever end   If you just hold on   Those clouds will soon be gone   There's a blessing in the storm   Help me sing it   There's a blessing in the storm..He's gonna spin like the tractor pull....You're so impossible   Scream and moan it chills my soul   Don't want to hear you got left behind   All those times you stayed up and cried   It's no lie   You did it to yourself   Like chewed up gum under my shelf   Don't look surprised   You must have know all along      It's just another love song   Another love song      It's never easy   It's not hard   When you've lost your mind   With you it's sleezy   Don't tell me your worries   I'm sick, I'll leave you blind   Now the time has come   To leave this love that's left you dry   No need to work this out now   Cause you know there's no reason why      It's just another love song   Another love song      I never told you it would last forever   You can't hold this boy for long, dig it   By the time you read my letter   Baby, I'll be gone      You're just another love song   Another love song.I used to walk with you   Along the avenue   Our hearts were carefree and gay   How could I know I'd lose you   Somewhere along the way?.Every time I get some good news, ooh,   There's a shadow on my back..Don't get me wrong, I'll be strong   When the slow burn sunset come along   You've gotta stay the night   I gotta think that you might..And finally they turned it on, you know   They grabbed it from me..Going down a mountain road, at 150 miles an hour, playin'   My guitar."
"Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers. This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are making a great impact! Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. This is useful in daly life all the time! Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented at things requiring their hands (like baseball or basket ball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too. Something as simple as driving a car doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in hand-eye coordination computers bring. This is a fantastic effect that computers have on people. In addition to the hand-eye coordination computers teach, they also help you learn about faraway places and people. This splendid information is easier to aquire thanks to the technowlogy of computers. ""@CAPS2 I didn't use my laptop for my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report,"" says @PERSON1, and @NUM1 grade student, "" I would never finish. Books take so long and I learned so much about my topic from my computer!"" @CAPS2 you are going on vacation, You can easily research your destination's location and culture with this advanced search engine. Why wouldn't you use a computer when you learn so much from them? Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other. They have lots of ways to video chat, @CAPS6 message, and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with. ""I had to move away from my best friend last @DATE1,"" says @PERSON3, resident of @LOCATION1, ""With my computer we can still talk to each other and stay friends."" computers are definatly a great way to communicate with friends and family. Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people; and even allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing! Ask yourself this, how would computers have a positive effect in your life?.I always try, I always miss   One of these days you'll go back to your home   You won't even notice that you are alone   One of these days when you sit by yourself   You'll realise you can't shaft without someone else   In the end you will submit   It's got to hurt a little bit.Whatever the food, let's hear the gong..[Verse 6]   Type writers and radios, now news was fast conveyed..Ha, lace up your booty   Going back to the roots, continue my interlude   Feed freakin' for loot   And my spell's been to check what your

wisdom, yours by best   Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth      This is what my Daddy told me   I wished he would hold me   A little more   than he did   But he told me my culture   And how to live positive   I never want to shame   The blood in my veins and bring pain   To my sweet grandfathers face   in his resting place   I make haste to learn and not waste   everything my forefathers earned in tears   For my culture      Fall back again   Crawl from the warm water   Water to air   You're on your feet again   Your feet again   (For my culture)      Fall back again

Whatever I want I can do to you   Whatever you say it's just giving me   Whatever I want baby I can do   Whatever I want      [Usher]   You can't get enough conversation I feel your touch   You're

God don't own a car   He don't wear no fancy clothes   He'd rather take the bus   He would pay a tourist fare   So he could sit with us   He don't have no tamborine   Guitar or slide trombone   The

"Dear Newspaper I think that computers were one @ORGANIZATION1 the best things ever created. They allow you to talk to people in far away places, help you learn about career and education choises, and you are able to learn about many subjects. Computers are here to help society not hurt it so why shouldn'y we use them? With @CAPS5 we can talk to people around the world or in space @CAPS2 that matter. You might not know it hut all @ORGANIZATION1 the communications in the world need a @CAPS5. There not the kind anyone could go out and but though. There satalites, the orbit the planet from space, @PERSON1, a proffesor at @ORGANIZATION1, told students at @ORGANIZATION3 that, ""A lot @ORGANIZATION1 every day items, such as rars and phones, all use some kind @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5."" @CAPS1 computers let people communicate with each other. In addition to letting people communicate they help millions @ORGANIZATION1 people make educational and career choises. Most kids that go to college don't know a lot @ORGANIZATION1 colleges out there. When my sister was picking what college she wanted to go to she didn't know which one to choose. She sat down and looked up hundred @ORGANIZATION1 schools. after narrowing it down she had made her decision she had picked @ORGANIZATION4, a @ORGANIZATION3 she had never even heard @ORGANIZATION1 a couple months ago. People are in this type @ORGANIZATION1 situation all the time at @ORGANIZATION2 a survey was taken by all the students to see what they wanted their career to be, @CAPS2 the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the week students got to experience diffrent carrer options. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the students picked a different carrer after that one week. Have you ever heard the old aget ""@CAPS3 is power""? well its true and computers are a great source @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3. they have many different subjects math, science, history language and much much more. people should be using this @CAPS3 at the @CAPS4 francisco national debate @PERSON2. Said that ""@CAPS5 are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places math. and even comunicating these are what computers should be used @CAPS2 not unhealthy games. You can learn about many new places with a @CAPS5. In @NUM1 grade my teacher had everyone do areport on a country me and my friend found this place we had both never heard @ORGANIZATION1. with the @CAPS5 we found onts @ORGANIZATION1 information on it such us its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts surely one would agree that a @CAPS5 is a great tool that should be used. It lots people communicate, helps in educational decisions, and you can learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a @CAPS5..With your little white lies, little white lies   With your little white lies, little white lies      I know you want it   I know you feel it too
