"like um Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place.People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories.Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer!This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society.The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology.You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly.so.. well.. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want.Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from.um I mean ... You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed.Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family.Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet.uh.. Ahhh And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family!Ahhh huh so.. well.. The computer age is here and it is exactly.What society needs.erm well.. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it.Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet?hmm like so.. I mean ... Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable.The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier.In addition,you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease!Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet.I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it!The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier.People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well!well.. so.. erm uh.. Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort.With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish.Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk.Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society.How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want!Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing.",12
"I mean ... like Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly.Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts.This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers.People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends.This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people.First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising.erm erm In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising.That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2!@PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors.uh.. huh Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years?uh.. Ahhh Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature.um like Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore.uh.. so.. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors.@PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”.Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends.In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter.erm hmm I mean ... Ahhh This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not.Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5.Do you want that for our youth?hmm well.. Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree.As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member.um huh like huh This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends.So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer.You have the power to make a difference in your real lives.But the question is, will you?",12
"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday.The question is what effects do computers have on people?I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people.They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others.Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety.hmm I mean ... Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination!Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination.A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer.Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us.Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill.These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people.Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1.He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date.He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that!erm like like well.. I mean ... Ahhh This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic.hmm well.. I mean ... like Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy.When you need information on the line.But why stop there?not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip.well.. um The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people.I mean ... so.. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online!There are many ways to do this.You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone.huh so.. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one.I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework.The problem was I forgot what it was!I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer.hmm like I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online.Sure enough he was!well.. hmm I got the home work and got an A all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others.",12
"well.. uh.. Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world.Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things.This concerns some people.Ahhh I mean ... They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing.But here is where they go wrong.These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond.@CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt.As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies.huh uh.. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence.Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago.erm so.. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad.Everyone goes on the computer.""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says.""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own.""This is an example not unlike many other student's parents.About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5.So why do we need these things?What seems to make them so important to us?The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected.um um Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple.Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor.""Everyone is already online.""@PERSON2, computer technician, informs.uh.. I mean ... ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?""@CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9.I mean ... like Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts.As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again.like I mean ... Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource.While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report.uh.. erm This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine.The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found.In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved.Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies.Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection.huh erm um like My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows.And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world.",12
"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community.One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills.um well.. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training.In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1.Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past.Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes.Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by.Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life.huh like When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old.well.. um These games also make you more intelligent.The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers.huh erm The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer.@CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills.erm huh Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online.They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships.I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3.Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative.huh huh These computers also improve social skills.@PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate.""Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that?These computers can even improve your mood.hmm hmm In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour.Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood.uh.. um Computers are great because they allow you to talk online.Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places.Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today.um well.. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6.You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia.You can even learn new recipes.like so.. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them!In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use.Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!""like like @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place.Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration.@CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community.",12
"To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 concern, today people of all ages are useing computers.huh so.. Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you @MONTH1 have needed to know.Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper.Teacher have troble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper.The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful.The near by libarry will always have extra computers students can use to write a papper.so.. I mean ... I mean ... like If you walk by a teenager on the internet, now a days you @MONTH1 find them on '@CAPS2'.'@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives.um well.. Some of these relatives @MONTH1 live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here.well.. um Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework?huh Ahhh The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that home work.There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'.like so.. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information.uh.. hmm Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there.I mean ... so.. well.. well.. By going on one of the search engines they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo.In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 & how it is in a @CAPS9.like erm Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope you will look into what I said.",8
"hmm like Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers.They belive that people use them all the time.uh.. well.. I dissagre with them.One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone.like uh.. This is a great idea!well.. so.. What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate?Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore?Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can!I mean ... huh so.. I mean ... Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer.um so.. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world.You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express.Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer!And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there.I mean ... I mean ... This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside.um um like huh To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place.So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places.Don't you think that is great?well.. uh.. Think about it.",8
"well.. um Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now.I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year.Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news.I totally agree with this.But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside.Here are ny thoughts on the computer.I mean ... uh.. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news.You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television.if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news.hmm well.. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities.hmm uh.. like Ahhh All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse.Secondly, the computer is like a tutor.Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you.Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer.This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn.Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe.Ahhh well..

"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers.like I mean ... I think that this is great.The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people.so.. Ahhh Keep reading to find out more.like uh.. erm Ahhh The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers.hmm well.. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard.hmm Ahhh Keep reading for more information.The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people.For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general.You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people.You can look up people like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's to @PERSON2 who is our presiden now.Keep reading for more information.I mean ... so.. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people.Ahhh um For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start talking to people.You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew.huh I mean ... huh erm Keep reading to find out more.Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing.They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online.I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen.So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it.hmm I mean ... Thank you.",8
"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society.I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work.uh.. hmm Overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer.But, some times it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1.Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line.uh.. well.. Also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @CAPS1.hmm so.. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online.And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time.Some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @CAPS3 be bullyed at their safe place, their home.um um Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise.A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said ""every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers.""@CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise.I mean ... I mean ... huh well.. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse.I mean ... um Lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students.like like erm huh Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend to much time all the computer.I mean ... like I was waching discovery chanel and it said that @CAPS3 most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework.uh.. uh.. The computer made for storing information and learning.How did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!",8
"Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have an bad effect on people.huh Ahhh I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier.We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up.I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people.Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net.erm like The next day she is on happy you are connected.erm so.. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet!Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2.hmm erm Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost.Other are very inportant.uh.. well.. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers.so.. Ahhh @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter.erm uh.. Not with computers.erm um So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot.um like This is great for not only school, children but adult to.I mean ... um That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers.so.. so.. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people.But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things.There is no bad effect of computers.The effects is just helpful ness.",8
