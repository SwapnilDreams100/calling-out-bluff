Thing about! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever time to chat with your friends or buisness partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace ect. Just think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidde in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Rather than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or child because it gives us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of troble. Thank you for listening."

In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail ""@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not posible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you amagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most buissness, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the castomer's convinence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her resturant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 wer not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there."

It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and ""boom,"" instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, ""@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future."

I think this because they help us communicate and video chat with family and friends online, used as a great tool with school work, or work purposes. Most of all for the enjoyment of children and now the fun computer games help them prepare for real life consequences,like how the game webkinz teaches kids to care for pets. ""@CAPS1 you have a @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5. ""@CAPS6, please friend request me"", I replied. Later that night, I get home and check my @CAPS2, a new notification pops up and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My entire family is on @CAPS2 and I think it's so usefull for several reasons, like making plans and parties. I hate writing invitations, but now every year for my birthday party I just type them up, taking less than five minutes. Or, for an even simpler way of sending invatations you can even just type an email or @CAPS2 message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over @CAPS2. It's so easy, you just create an event and tag all of your friends in the note. Also, it's so easy to get @CAPS13's because you automatically get notified. Technology like this drastically makes life easier. For example, have you ever gotten something new and just can't wait to show your friends? Well, now you can, in the comfort of your own home. All you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too. ""@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!"" I said. ""@CAPS15 you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty,"" says @PERSON1. I love webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were in the same exact you. As you can see, webcamming is so much easier than spending more time money, and my moms time and getting a ride over her house. Computers make life so much more convienent. Another example how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand writing and most kids won't like writing it anyways. Like myself, I type faster than I write and that's why I agree @PERCENT1 that computers benefit society. Most importantly, computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you. How impressive would that be? If I was applying for a professional position of a job, I know I'll type my resume. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, beneficial, important and fun to our society."

The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one."

You go on at @TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're changing too, so you @MONTH1 be off to college or have to move far away for buissness. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye."" my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places.

It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across the world. They teach many things for people to learn and that have already learned. Such as, hand-eye cordination. When you type up words it teaches you to see better with your eyes. Computers also, give people the ability to see, understand, and gives information about people across the world. Celebraties are very popular on computers or other technologies. Computers help you learn things better than any other technologies. Anything you can get on any other technologies. There is a guarantee of you will find it on your computer. Computers are just like other technologies but in some categories they're much better than the others. Computers are very important in life because without computers we would not learn how to communicate with each other. If we did not have phones to use to call someone. On the computer if you go online you can maybe talk to someone by their email address. You can talk to someone that you have not talk to in years. You can look images or videos that you haven't seen in years. On computers, you can find out information from news that week of or even the day of. In conclusion all I say is that without computers in this world. What would it be like? Most technologies that are not as good computers will be popular without computers. I wonder what it will be like?"

I am an @NUM1 grade student at @PERSON1. I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benifit society. i completly disagree with these comments. let me explain... Having computers definatly benifits for all students. Sometimes kids forget their text books at school. But if they have a computer, they can just google the information. That way they get there homework done, and don't have to take a zero. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called, study island. If you havn't, i'ts a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an @CAPS2 on study island we get an @CAPS2 in one of our classes.. Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no instructions in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called synewnisia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. The piano helps my hand-eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication. Now, synewnesia isn't the only free instrument learning program. There are many others! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you acheive things later in life. Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completly true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well one day when I went on google the top search of the day was, ""weight watchers diet plan"". Also, my mom uses an online video workout website, for her bad back. So not only does the computer help for diets, they can help physical therapy also. So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benifite our society, yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But, online learning sessions can be time consuming. It helps many people figure out the right deit and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy."

Now you @MONTH1 be saying thats not true, that everyone has a computer, but the truth is they don't and they believe it puts negative attitude on people. People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends. Did you @CAPS5 some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from differnt states who live far away. For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can make a connection because I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that I use to stay in contact with family friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I @CAPS5 that many people want to learn about people from differnt countries and this is one way to do it right now I am learning some new things about the @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. While on this wonderful adventure of learning you @MONTH1 even get yourself into a vacation adventure. A recent test was taking stating that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't @CAPS5 where. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature.These people are wrong if one is on a computer and they are chating with someone from a differnt state or country then that person might persuade them to take a visit there. For example they would be able to go to the internet type in the place they want to visit and get photographs and information about the place. As a result, people would still get to enjoy nature. Sometimes using the computer could be educational. Many people @MONTH1 disagree with that statement but its true. For example when on the computer many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @MONTH1 affect their work scheduale. This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studing. It would also help them on their reports. For example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to. As a result, the students grades would increase. I hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind. As a result for those who didn't agree with the statement that they are positive not negative I hope that you will redecide on your opion."

Computer are ruining these things for people. Unplug yourself from your computer. More and more people are becoming obese. This is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers. There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face. To our whole life, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be happy where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face. Get out and get some fresh air. Go experience nature. Bring out on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most. Fresh air clear your mind.

In this country we can. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again. Looking at places far away is always an option. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even going to different countries, even different continents is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plan tickets. reserve rooms, even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk. and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't see his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, facebook, myspce, skype, etc, is allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instint, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their, it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad?"

Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find what was for homework, and how the internet does not effect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet, You know what people say, you learn something new everyday. Well, if you are wondering about something or if you're think about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for, @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for your project you need. My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If your a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick. No, you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go out side, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life, in a good way. If you don't have a t.v. and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy, or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not effect your exercise, or interacting with family. To support this I stated, people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if you missed a day, and how the internet effects your everyday life in a good way."

I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic."

You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people."

Well, if you have this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device.

Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. They also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning. Most people try not to be overweight. Experts should Not try to have less people on the computer. One reason is that people can chat with one another. It can be friends, families, and more. About @PERCENT1 of people chat online with families or friends. Chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. It can make someone a better person. You can't agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand-eye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet. Using the computer this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the for a while is not a waste of time. People can you their time wisly on the computer. Surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer. So you should try to make people be on the computer less often."

Have you ever had to write a paper and there wen't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? @CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable @CAPS2 and the can be fun too. To begin with let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? @CAPS1 you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably wan't answer because they're @CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker more efficient and reliable.

For example, @CAPS5. @CAPS5 is used by teens and adults like, and for one reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. @CAPS1 you to another date and wait to see what your last friend's up the best thing to do would be to go on @CAPS5 and ask A @ORGANIZATION1 shows that in a family of five, four of them use the @CAPS3 to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. In conclusion, whether you're bored at home and it's a rainy day, or @CAPS1 you have to nght a research paper you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. Positive effects computers have - are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use."

I took the idea of waiting this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple things. Such as: homework assignments such as essays, sometimes peoples family members go off to was but can't use cell phones, also online job alpications. To start off with, kids have homework assignment right? Most of the time people have to do essays. I ask my mom lots of times if I can do an essay for school, she say, ""why don't you stay after to do it?"" @CAPS1 have lives so they can't stay after, also at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reasons kids use computers alot. Next,, some family members go off to war. Normally for safly and privacy, they wont let the soldiers life their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they to know their ok so they don't have to for two years. So, the base they ace at you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job aplications. Most of the time people are home bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commertials show avertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types for people, homebound, elderly, ect. But mostly its good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you get good pay still. In conclution, Some people don't go online just to be online they actually are doing something such as talking to their loved ones that they wont see for along period of time, also school assignments. Plus, if people don't know people very well how do they know if they're active or not kids, and adults, should still be able to use computers when ever they want."

I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos, even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it let's you know things as well. The computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool. The programs teach you how to type, it is called type to learn or type for fun. Also they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it let's you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You have friends with and know who they are and won't need to figure it out. So, this is why I believe that having a computer is a good idea, and good to have. You can talk to people long distance. The computer teaches you things for life. Finally it makes you more social with people. So in @CAPS1 strong opinion it is a good idea to have a computer."

Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a @ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost @NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. Yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to @CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my @CAPS2 always said,"" @CAPS3 more, it builds character!"" @CAPS4 ever I get the chance I @CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids theses days can be mean with out try.

I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to."

Why is there a need to spend your precious life sitting in front of a compute all day?When you can be getting exercise for example going to your local gym. Computers become a distraction to your social life, thats why you should use them for emergency's and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends. Lastly you can enjoy you surrounding and appreciate life and nature. Computers are meant for business not for people to sit around and to nonsense things. Exercise is very important it helps the human body grow and stay in fit. If your sitting in front of a computer all day your body is going to shut down and won't get the proper exercise. Sports can be just as enjoyable and helps build the human body and gives you the right amount of exercise that your body needs. Sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion exercising can give you all of the same utensils that computers give you but it also benefits citizens more. Family is a wonderful thing in life, but they don't live forever. That's why we should cherries every last moment we have with them. A complete citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends. To sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals, for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergency's and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction. Instead of using them we could be getting the right amount of exercise, and spending it with family, and lastly enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly consider that you take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them. "

I believe that computers benefit society. I believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online. It also gives you thousands of websites to learn valuable information from. Lastly it teached hand-eye coordination. First computers alow you to socialize online. I know @CAPS1 I get home from school I can talk to virtually any friends online. People against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family, however, this is not true. I talk to all of my aunts via facebook and other social websites. Also @CAPS1 my parents are at work the are abile to message me over the computer with out having to go get a phone and call my house. My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get intouch easier lets say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He woulden't have to go look up a number and call me, he could just send me a message of the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education. I know that @CAPS1 I'm stuck on a problem at home, I'll just go on the computer and look up the answer. Also, @CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids, @CAPS1 doing a project, I can't getall of my information from one book so I go on the computer and look up information about the subject. This really improves students grades, because they had more resources and more information to choose from, instead of only the information in the book. My last reason is that using a computer can help with hand-eye coordination. On the computer there are many sites that have very interactive sites the you can really benefit from I know of one website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had interactive games that would actually help with things is real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball. So the computer actually helped with real life activities. To sum it all up I think computers can benefit society a lot. Like being able to communicate with your friends. Also being able to look up school work with. Lastly helping with hand-eye coordination."

Computers are advancing and so are their uses, computers are great and they are not our thought process or went to run around outside and play sports. Computers help us find and talk to relatives and friends they allow us to learn different things about farien places. They also are great for research! First and foremost computers are effecting us positively expesally when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted and @NUM1 years ago she really wanted to find her birth family, one year later her birth father found her on this website where you can locate family, she found her family and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have of been able to get to know them if it wasnt for the computer, speaking of communication, I was working like a dog on this big science prodject I had. we weren't able to do it in person and it @CAPS3 impossible for one person to three way four people. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done. ""@CAPS2 are never enough hours in the day!"" @CAPS3 something that @CAPS3 commonly said. Over @PERCENT1 of adults complain that @CAPS2 @CAPS3 never enough time in day. That @CAPS3 a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi task so you can be on your business call and email your mother so she know that you didn't forget her birthday. In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are doing. @CAPS2 are many people who don't have tvs and they get their news from the internet. Also for projects, in @NUM2 grade I had to learn about @CAPS4, the country in @LOCATION2. it would take countless hours to find research in books, you will find a lot of stuff you dont need, but on the computer it @CAPS3 fast and easy. If you need to know something you can just type it in and, boom! You have it where as if you were usinf a book you would still be looking for what you need. Time @CAPS3 something that we can't afford to waste expessaly in this economy. Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer, and exersizing are not always right. I don't know about you, @PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exersizes to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions, finding routs on maps are enfuriating and take for ever. Go on the computer the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with finger prints fast so no one can get hurt. In conclusion computers effect us in possitive ways, more and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye in this matter, advancing computers are our friends not the enemy."

But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. Humans especially children, need exercise. But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. @NUM1 year olds are making facebooks! You can find @NUM2 year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their ""friends"" lie to them, about their age, another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2,@CAPS3, farmpring, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to at back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. Computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop it."

People how can go on to their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or just because the internet to watch videos and stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows sre available on today's computer! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute go on the internet type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, expect with greater efficiency and with more places to choosen from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read of the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind-blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. Howeer, any information needed to your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spent time with your family, you can even look your computer up to a tv and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly. What society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on the you know nothing about it. Would you rather drive minutes going and thirty minutes looking withb everything you need, or do you think it's more to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the later of the is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition,you can create entire presentations on a computers with surprising ease! Being an eighth grade student, I dont know I would ever do woithout the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best project on it! The computer is the likes of all the hard working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computer make communicating with friends and familyeasier as well! Through e-mail, video chat and instant messaging., we can communicate with whoever we would, whenever we wort. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we will one again have to resort to snail mail, whcih makes instant communication @CAPS3 telephones, we would have no other way to talk. Computers have enhanced communication chill likes so graetly that it's foolish to say their not beneficial to society. How can a machine with so many abilities be for see the computer as a brooden research for school and we want! Bottom line the computer age is here and its amazing."

Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great."

There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also it always gives you information everytime you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not everytime when you need information the computer won't give it to you. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have alot more fun adavantages. One of the most common and used thing around the world is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 is when you are communicating with another human bean over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend. There are some names for instant @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4-mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people I agree that they stay on the computer to much and became very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you from exercizing and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more, but to long is not good. There are so many things for the computer I can't name them all @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers, those are many of the things you can do on your computer. I love going on the computer time to time doing many things I have talked about. Also if you do have one than reading this @MONTH1 persuade you into getting one. My opinion is that they give you a very positive effect."

For example people use computers to get imformation, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and fined friends. I think this @CAPS6 messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers @CAPS6 messing people up @CAPS6 because of the impformation that @CAPS6 on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This @CAPS6 ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people @CAPS6 the dangerous chat rooms. This @CAPS6 not good because your not familliar with the person your talking too. The person could have posed as another person and be very hipocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasent. Like you might give them you number, adress, @CAPS2 personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, @CAPS2 ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that @CAPS6 given to thousands of people online. Another words the""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" @CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" @CAPS9 these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on."

The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family.Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family. These ar my reason why i think that we shouldn't be on the computers. We should spend more time with friends family or go outside, and enjoy nature."

I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy. In conclusion I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them."

Even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them. Since. new technology, and post pictures on websites where everyone can see. Also they have games for computers that people get hooked on. Lastly, there are predator online. The new technology is amazing, like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures, @CAPS1 they do have negative effects. There have been many suicides over cyber bullying. This is where people bully kids over the internet. Also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming. this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions. Also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life. There are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites. Most people actually get addicted to the game, They would play it all day if they could and if they arent playing they are wishing they could. This makes them miss out on alot of things. They might not get enough excersise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop. They could also not be spending time with family. It also might change who you are as a person. The most important thing about the use of computers is your safety. There are predator all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live. You should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online. They can and most likely will come to your house for you. It could most likely cost you or even family members your lives. Computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it. Remember not to tell anyone where you live or dont take pictures and send them that are personal. They could be all over the internet the next day. Lastly, worry about your family, grades, and health than some useless game. Be smart and safe!"

It helps them see the world if they can't. It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. So here is examples of these three things. Some people can't physically or mentally and can't afford to travel. Its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can't go places. But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they've never been to which can help them see the world better. But there are people who can help them see the world better. But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. Then there are people who can't afford it. So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. What happened and that it wasn't what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can't talk or see them. Someones in the military and he/she has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. Also you see a friend in facebook who you haven't seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. It can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world. Which isn't bad sure we sometimes go over board with it but it is very useful. It isn't horrible but it is sometimes bad but also sometimes good but"

This is @CAPS3 it teaches hand eye cordanation, allows people to learn about far away places, and to talk to other people online. Computers have great positive effects for everyone. Computers teach hand eye cordanation. When a person is typing they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters. Computer games help to teach this @CAPS3 in the game things happen very quickly so the person has to ee whats going on and click the correct key fast thus improving hand eye @CAPS1 greatly. Studys do show that people who use computers have a @PERCENT1 better hand eye @CAPS1 then some one who dosen't. Coumputers help hand eye @CAPS1 and they can teach you about far away places. Someone can learn about far away places by searching it up online. They will get many facts about that place. Sheral from @LOCATION4 said ""I heard some one at school mention @LOCATION2 and didn't know a thing about it so I searched it and got a ton of facts."" This shows the computer can help someone learn about foiren countrys and they can talk to people far away. Using the computer soemone could talk to you while your hundreds or thousands of miles away. Tehy can do this through e-mail of video chat. a @CAPS2 showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat @CAPS3 its faster and the two people can see each other. However either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS3 of video chat I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3 who I almost never see. This gos to show that the computer is a positive thing for people. The computer is helpful in so many ways it teaches hand eye cordniation, it allows people to learn about far away places and it allows for people to talk to other people.

Where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @CAPS9, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean its bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other student's parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""@CAPS6 all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?"" @CAPS7, as the famous saying, @CAPS8 your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @CAPS9. Being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. As you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @CAPS7 you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @CAPS9 one even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world."

Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. @CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people? Go and talk to them in real life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go. Thank you for your concern"

The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out @MONEY1 @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to eachother face to face anymore. They all talk on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Commmunities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, ther spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provides financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the commputer."

When you don't excersise, and all you do is eat junk food and drink today, you better bet on your mothers grave that your going to either get diabetes, the fly, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it, why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an ""innocent"" invention. Now a days, people literally worship the computer like it is a @CAPS3. People who use the computer all day every day, end becoming very lazy, because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity. Whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active atleast three times a week for many reason, fact is, that if you excersise three times a week at the least, that your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. excersise can be fun, as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. excersise should be a huge part of your daily routine, now sitting on your buttox all day searching pointless videos on ""youtube."" The way you want to live your life is up to you. And I hope to @CAPS3 that you start living it healthier."

The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be to much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough.

So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly."

Throughout the ages we have been evolving, from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly. With evoloution we discovered technology and in recent years we have been making new technologies rapidly. Some say that some technology like computers are bad, I think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about for away places. let you talk to people online and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers let you go places that you ordinarilly wouldn't be able to go to. If you were doing a research projects on @LOCATION1 and you didn't have any books what would you use? That's right, a computer the internet would have the facts you needed, so you could grade. While on the internet you could talk to friends and family who @MONTH1 live for away. The computer goes over long distances and connects both computers so you can bend writing almost instantly. Without computers you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people. Using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. It helps you with your hand-eye coordination. When you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body. Some people say that when you are on the computer you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. I myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too! I love computers, don't you?"

Not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer all I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before I now believe the computer takes time away from family time to get the sitting down to read a good book and hanging out with friends. Insteed of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook, myspace, twitter, youtube, addicting games, and whatever else they could find. I do not agree with that being sluck to the computer like is to chese. No! If there was our thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distracts kids and teenagers from doing other things in life, also it doesn't follow families to be a family. Before computers were made all people bad was their family. Coming home from school saying ""@CAPS3 dad, home from school. What t go play see catch""? Instead of that kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to your facebook message.

I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of. I hope that my lette and probably many others show you about computers actually do."

Most kids come home from school and go on aim. So they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obiese. I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun. Also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together. The kids will see more nature and be bale to learn more about animals. When kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing. ALso some kids post pictures of themselves on things like facebook that are not appropriate and cna get them in lots of trouble. They also say things that they wouldn't normally say to a persons face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble. Whne your outside palying baseball, football or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and your having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obies. Some say the computer is good hand eye coordination but catching a football or hitting is bettre. Also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends is better than talking in your friends or video chatting with them, @CAPS2 are to many over weight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not heloing the cause.

A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their buisness is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper. Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but thats them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people! They give us research, they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world."

Well computers teaches kids a lof of things like hand-eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when there older they can learn new to work with it. There is also websites that can show you how to move yor hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the comptuer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dont have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time. That is why I think you should keep computers and not exercise as much. We get enuf of that in school carry all these heveay books around."

People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the great inventions we have. They are very helpul in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. If your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. Also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things. Finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is @CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want your friends you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpul in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends I hope, you see my point at view they are samething everyone should have."

Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that @CAPS1 first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example who is harry @PERSON1. He was the @NUM1 president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can alway's excrise around there house or around there block."

Also people will have the ability to learn about different states and countries. I ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns. Those are all the reasons why I think computers are a good use. The first reason why I think people should use computers is it will teach people to have hand-eye coordination. People will know how to stay focussed with their eyes and also know how to also use their hands all at the same time. To stay focussed with their eyes people would have to wear glasses for the light. Also so when they are typing they wont have to keep looking down all the time. When people coordinate with their hands on the computer its so they know were the different are thats why computers are good. My second reason why computers are good is because people will have the ability to learn about the different states and countries. They can also see how nice or bad the countries and states look. Also they will be able to read about what different cultures they have and religions. In the states also be to read about @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and how we have a wonderful state. That's why computers are good use. My final reason why the use of computers is good because, people can interact with their family and friends online. There are a lot of different websites you can go to that you can search for one of your family members or friends. You can talk to each other. Also you can talk to them even if their in a different state. You guys can talk about a lot of different things. For example, the family and life and even if you miss them. Thats why computers are good. Those are my reasons why computers are good. Not only can it teach you about hand-eye coordination, family and friends, and about different states. But also you can play a lot of different games and also type on an notepad. Also if your stuck on a math problem you can use the calculator. That's why people should use the computers."

Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet, also you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly. On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, webchat and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: facebook, myspace, and twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures. Web chatting is a way to video people. You can personally see someone from acroos the @ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses, microsoft office word, powerpoint, excel and @CAPS4. Each of these are used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Business also use webchatting, as I previously state, for conference calls. A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In the end computers are a necessary item in a business. In conslusion, computers have a great affect on people. The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, connect humans with each from half way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. @CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?"

Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying "",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!"" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, amking many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see. Please understand the meaning how terrible computers are."

Some people dont even get enough sleep if they stay up too late on computers. Also they spend less time exersizing and less time interacting with family and friends. Thos are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph I am going to tell you about why I think that people should @CAPS4 other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy dont blame them the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer?

I mean theres a whole lot of side effects."" @NUM1 out of @PERCENT1 of parents agree with me and @CAPS1 first reason. In this paragraph I am telling you @CAPS1 second reason as @CAPS3 why I disagree which is less time excersizing. (@CAPS3 the parents) @CAPS4 you realy want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all days or @CAPS4 you want your kids to excersize and get healthier? @CAPS1 friends kids always are on the computer everyday all the time and thats not verry healthy @CAPS3 them especialy because they're young. So a couple of weeks ago I talked to them about being active and how its not good to be on the computer alot. Now they bearly go on the computer they always are outside and playing and running around. @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON3 says that ""@CAPS5 excersize is better than doing anything non active also it can be fun. @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2.

Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and ""I.M.'s"", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""world of warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. It is things like this that make life that much easier for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. These are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. I know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. Being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. These are some of the reasons that I and others love computers. But I have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?"

They teach us skills like hand-eye coordination, they allow you to talk online, and learn about faraway people and places. I do believe that it benefits society even though many people dont. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine. I know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teamate passes the ball to him and he can't catch it because he has no hand-eye coordination skills. That wouldnt happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, that help build that up. When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination. out of @NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online. Its the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better and they tell you things that they dont want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Lets say you want to know about someone famous, you look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doning anyone good. Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We dont want out society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to furter our education or not?"

Communication is a vital part @ORGANIZATION1 america and the world in this day and age. Communication is souly run by the commputer. @CAPS3 computers provide better and faster communication.

I asked my friend @PERSON3 what @CAPS2 thought of those things and @CAPS2 said ""They are great interacting websites."" They really aren't. They are websites on the computer. While you are on the computer your not really maintaing a social life. Your town holds activites or has a fun place you could too. Your town @MONTH1 have a gym, community center, or a library. Go their and hangout with friends interact with them. Go to school, goto the library, and hang out with friends are great ways to interact with people. People don't think about @CAPS1 your sititng in your computer chair and @CAPS5. While your sitting in the chair your not excercising, @CAPS1 you keep @CAPS5 your gaining weight. You might get fatter @CAPS1 your stuffing your face wih cheez- itz and not excersising I asked @PERSON2 a question it was what do you do while your on the computer? @CAPS2 said ""I eat.."" @CAPS5 isn't bad, but @CAPS1 your not really paying attention you eat more than you need. Your town has rec leaguges of sports such as @CAPS6, softball, and baseball. Join a team instead of playing on the computer and @CAPS5. Get @CAPS7! Computers aren't the greastest things in the world. You don't stay fit with them, you aren't very social, and you don't really spend time with your family. Computers don't really help you grow up, and be mature for the future."

Sometimes kids dont even like to go do exercises they stay on the computer eating & eating. I think if their was no technology kids these days wont be beast. Some kids dont even like hanging out with their friends or family they say that they want to stay home on the computer but we should do more, exercises than being on the computer.

As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity. All of these results are long term which causes you life to be okay. I dont you want a happy and successful life?! I know I do!"

But I think diferent. Computers benefit society more than you would think. They help people learn and makes work much easier. They help prevent acidents, and the save lives. Computers help people learn and make work easier its a fact. You can type you can plan your sedual. You can make a presantation or check your email. All of those things make work easier. And there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Makeing work easyer or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computers abilitys. Computers can prevent acidents in anything that moves. For example cars millions on the road today and some can practily drive them selves. And that is all done with computers. Also planes, the only reason the piolot is there is in case something gose wrong. Same thing with trains. Furthermore @CAPS1 are completly computerized all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its own power has been computerized at some point in time. And that makes the world safer for every one. Finaly computers save lives, its completly true. In hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs and asist with surgery. In surgery computers help by only haveing to make a tiny insision and can be much more acurate than human sergons which save lives. Also computers can mak sure that a operating room is completly sterial which reduces risks of infection. As you can see computers benifit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easyer. They prevent acidents with which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go they are almost garenteed a survival. So what do you think about them now."

Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to! It is evident, that computers are effective, and are advancing technology in our society."

First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend @NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be playing. a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me "" @CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?"" and i answer ""@CAPS2 i have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3."" @CAPS4, the computer takes time away from nature. People dont acknowledge the beauty of the outdoor.

Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature."

Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you @MONTH1 not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or laptop is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the @CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a @CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society."

The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run soley by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also state that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computer teach hand-eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer based video games can prepare you for real life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 maker you dodge bricks and can greatly improves reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there. This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than use, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world an learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 move to @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. @CAPS3 were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and @CAPS3 immeadiatly started video chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of computer has affected communication. I belive that it is an effective too that everybody should have access to."

Some people think computers are bad because some people spend too much time on their computers. The thing is computers help us with our everyday life. If we want to comunicate with people from around the world to send donations to places in need like @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1, we can use computers to do that. We can chang people's lifes in third world countries with the help of computers. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online. Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that the users fault not ours. We should choose how long were using one computers. Many jobs would be impossible with out computers. It's not about overusing them its about. So over all I say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands."

Some people use them to get online education. Other use them to talk to family and friends that are far away. Also student use them to do research for school. These are reason why computer could be a good devices. There are many people that now have the ability to get a online education because of problem that they have. For example people that can't walk and don't like going to regular school. The computer would help them find website that they could get a free education. The computer would see what level there in like a regular teacher. The computer would make it so easy and better for the people that don't have the ability to walk they can even study for test that they have on the computer. This one reason why many people use computer. Many family use computer to try to look for freind that they haven't seen in a long time or family that are far away. They even contact them by chatting threw websites. They also search for addressed and phone number. Many people get to find there family threw internets. They meet in spot are even come to one another hauses. The computer would allow their dreams to happen by finding their familys. This would be an exciting event for them this why they need computer. This is one very important reason student use computer to research projects. Without computer student won't be able to look for information they need to know. The computer would teach student about people in the past they didn't know or didn't got to meet. The computer would influence them to want to learn more about interesting history. Children need computer to make there intelligence go up higher. These are some reason why I think we all need computer. We need them for people that don't have the ability to walk, for people that have family and friend far away, and for student that would like to learn more. These are all things people enjoy doing on a computer. If there are no computer it would crush everybody dream and future. So this are some reason why many people decide to be on computer."

Computers help people so much in schools, work places, and at home. Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers. For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays, letters and so many other writing pieces, and the same goes for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students use computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some @ORGANIZATION1 even more. For example my @CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters. She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can't read it she can't grade it. I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write the things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose, soon hand writing will no longer ne required. Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs, for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could ""take control"" of people and people would spend to much time on them. But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time, keeping computers would benefit in so many ways. Writing many different essays, letters, typing for projects, and doing research would be done faster and easier."

There is many ways computers can have posotive effects on humans, first computers bring people together and let people interact with each other, They let people talk to each other. Computers also let people learn about new things. The internet has so much information. Computers also let people do things that they can't do with out computers. So computers have a positive effect on people. Computers let people interact with each other. The computers bring people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it. But with email they would get it the second you send it. There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people. When you and you freind cant talk together you just have to get on you computer. Computers also have web camera, those let people talk to echother. and you can see them. It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone thats why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet. If you someone else they might not know the answer. Computer let people see pictures and videos. If you wanted to see a picture of @CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Vidios let you watch things like something funny to cheer up you day. If you love a show on to, and you missed it you can find it on computer. That is why computer benifit people positively. Computers also let you do things that you couldn't do without. When a teacher asks me to type a paper I always do it on the computer. If there were no computers I would have to use a typewriter and if I made a mistake I would have to type the whole thing again. Computers also alow you to play music. On the computer you can put a cd in and it will play the music. Computers alow you to do things that couldnt do without Computers benifit society an have a positive effect on people, They let people interact with each other and they bring people together. They let people talk to each other. Computers also let you learn about newthings. They also let you do things that you couldnt do without. Computers have many positive effects on people so I hope you agree that computers benifit soctity"

Frist of being if you wast all you're time being of the computer there is nothing there is nothing you can get done as I have notice many shildren are on computer every right after school playing on the computer. For example my cosiun is on the computer evryday doing  but wasting his time are you still with me. Secondly children should be studying on the computer not playing video games and going in website that are not allowed more then @NUM1 do students and children are on the internet palying video games and doing something the is done everyday also I have seen many kids playing games on the computer. Thirdly student will never learn nothing if they wast there time because computer is for studing and many students don't have there time wisely as they should also many student should be useing comput only sometimes not everyday I have notice that so many students don't learn from compu for because they are not studing tests mre then @PERCENT1 stundent fail classes because of computer. First of people should be spending time with  and friends because they are teh most important people aroun ud not computers. Are still with me? Secondly friends are the most important people I ever had because they care about and love you like you're ther families but what if you just wast youre on computer how are you know all your friends. For example m allways on comput never goes to see her friemds amd her friends to to here because she never cares about their only computer do god get what im saying here. Thirdly family is also important then just being on the computer because they care about you have to at lease spend sometime with family for example many families stop spending time with each othe because computer is important to them. Lastly help you're community is goal because you make you\re city look you don't want it he be massy also many people quit help with commicity servic around the neighbor for example I have see  trash on grounds and because they dont care.

You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable."

I, for one do not. I think a decent amount of time on the computer, you can benefit from. But I do belive that computers are a huge part of peoples lives now. I think that people should get off the computer, and get some exercise more and more people would be so much healthier, if they took the time they were on the computer and exercised instead. On the computer you can look up places and see beautiful pictures of places, nature, and even people. But if people got off the computers and traveled and enjoyed nature, they would be able to live it, not just see a picture. Everything would be so much more fun if you were there and got to experience it, not just read about it. Another reason why I feel so strongly about people spending less time on computers is because they don't spent much time interacting with family and friends when you are the computer to much it seems like you drift away from you friends and family. Almost as if you are to ""busy"" to see them. So as you can see I highly disagree with the overuse of computers."

Below, I will explain each reason. Firstly, its very educational. Computer are like a giant resource of information. Many teachers @MONTH1 direct their students online @CAPS2 learning purposes. Also, alot of people go online to research information @CAPS2 their school, job, or a project. Great websites that are packed with information, like @ORGANIZATION1, can only be accessed using a computer. @CAPS2 example imagine having to do your research using only books, but you live far @CAPS6 a library. The internet makes that research very easy, as you access to @CAPS7 any time! Secondly, they make things very easy to do. Computer provide people with many easy, convieniant ways to do many tasks. If there werent any computers in the world. don't you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging? Almost all of the @CAPS4/@CAPS5 in the @LOCATION2 like @PERSON1's, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them In buy things online, which is way more easy than going by car. I remember a time when I wanted to by something @CAPS6 a store all the way in @LOCATION1 I went online at home and bought @CAPS7 there! Also, @CAPS7 makes things like ordering @CAPS8, getting plane tickets, getting help alot much easier & @CAPS7 saves time! Thirdly, computers are very enjoyable! They provide alot of @CAPS17 things to do! @CAPS2 example if you are bored you can get on computer, & search @CAPS2 a game you enjoy. There is always a game you'll like. On of all of that, you enjoy @CAPS7 by talking to your friends and Family. You stay in touch, while enjoying their company. Another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another, lightining @CAPS10 because of email. Imagine that you don't have a phone, and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip, that you son is very sic. If you send @CAPS7 by mail, @CAPS7 take at least @NUM1 days. By email, only a couple minutes so, you can see that computer also can provide some @CAPS11 of safety @CAPS2 everybody! So, as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @CAPS13 ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @CAPS1 learn. They make things like ordering @CAPS8, getting tickets, or contacting helpl very easy @CAPS15, they are very enjoyable, @CAPS6 playing @CAPS17 games, to staying in touch with your Friends and Family. Don't you think that without computers we'd probably suffer? I think computers have a great effect on people"

First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth grade teachers once said, ""@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big french paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!"" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers! "

Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves '@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!"

Well its true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socilizing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer, and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town. There is another @CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of. People you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing. There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actuall important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy. Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework. Its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school. How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather people always want to know breaking news. Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting. There is one more topic that I know youre going to absoltly love. I mean right now your grading this in your office, well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl. People work from home all the time. you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns company and works from home most days. Its absoutly @CAPS1 be is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying its only a click away here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there, well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple keys and boom, your on your way to see your information. That was faster then two hours i'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future. So the next time you log on to your comptuer do some of these things and turst me your will think exactly what I think."

Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exersize any more because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good."

They are on the computers when they should be exercising. People need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends. Let me explain more. Firstly, the people who are consently @CAPS1 people, facebooking people, or on myspace aren't getting exercise. Now, more than ever people are becoming very obese. It is very unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and becoming overweight. Eight out of ten @CAPS2 aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers, they don't sit back, relay and take in nature. People don't get that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinced they are not comming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone. Computers are the wall between inside and going outside in back at the world. Finaly, the computers are getting in the way of seeing family and friends. Everyone is so caught up in the newist computer they don't see their friends or family I know some people who when its time for dinner, they walk down to the kitchen. Get their food and bring if to their computer so they don't miss out on anthing family and friends are very important. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 onley see friends and family on holidays. Computers are getting in the way of everything! People arent getting the exercise they need. They aren't going outside to enjoy the nature and the arent seeing there friends and family. We need to get people off their butts and away from the computer. Why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway?"

The reason why I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people @MONTH1 have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer.

For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people."

But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people. And computers do really break @CAPS4 because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. So you mostly spend about @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ as fix it. And there new computers come and its like @NUM3$ and @NUM4$ and there different just from beand and ther go aboutmore faster. And whne people's computer break some go crazy and feel like doing some cordy stuff. Ther does feel like they does friends they only stay at the room for every they never down out at all and if they do come out the room they instly dont respect there parents they do whatever they feel like doing and they they act into troubles with the . So computers do help out sometimes they dont but maybe should make different changes."

I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8? Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it neccessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at to go industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculatir or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think @ORGANIZATION1 computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example @MONTH1 need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead @ORGANIZATION1 a book with a few authors."" @CAPS7 day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest @ORGANIZATION1 his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book.

Getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer. When you are on the computer. When you are on the computer for more than @NUM1 minutes ayou start to get lazy and not wanting to get up. That affects a lot of people @DATE1 because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer. Kids are harder because they don't want to do something other than just sitting on the computer instead of when they come back from school because they are so tired, if we limit the time they use the computer it will be better for kids, grown ups, and your brain. When adults spend a lot of time on the computer due to there jobs or checking their email, a lot of times they don't interact with their family or other people because they are on the computer I can connect with this because @CAPS4 dad is always on the computer due to his office not talking to us or even seeing is. Sometimes I wish that the world should of never invented computers because I get so frustated with them, but a lot of times we do spend family time and its good to get away from your computers beside thats what makes the money. Emailing, chating, @CAPS3, aim, @CAPS2 are all echnology communication using these communcation is helpful if somebody can't text or doesn't have a phone you can always chat them on @CAPS3 or send them an email. Email & @CAPS3 are the only @NUM2 communications I @CAPS4 dad sends use a lot of emails to @CAPS4 soccer coach about how I am not going to be at a game or I am going to a game, and he always responds. It is very easy. @CAPS3 is a good way for kids to talk to one another because some might not have phones or you don't see them at all during the school day. It's a good way to communicate without @CAPS3 or email I don't know what would happen, but I knoe it would be bad. So you see how computers have positives or negatives getting lazy, not spending enough time with friends or family and talking to friends are all positive & negative conflicts of the computer."

We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. For I myself, that I. The internet is a quick way to get the reseach. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. Final grade @CAPS2 I did not type it, on a computer. Typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a neccessity for living."

More and more people are being sucked into electronics and less people are caring about our planet. Their are so many great things out there that could be put at risk. People @MONTH1 say that if you spend allot of time on the computer they would be able to find cure's for the deseases out there. Those are just lies to stay lasy and waste their life on the computer. What is going to happen to all of the sports in the world. The players are going to get old and they will retire and if no one is going to take their place then the games would be cancled. I am a big fan of football and I don't want to see it ge cancled. Some of my friends are saying they are addicted to the computer and I always hope they get out of that habit because what's going to happen when they get older they are going to need a @CAPS2. If they stay addicted they won't want a @CAPS2 and they what they won't have money, they can't pay bills, and they would lose their house. Why do people say they could find cures for things by looking on the computer we all know that's not true. They need to learn about them first not by just looking on the computer. They @MONTH1 not want to but they would have to look in books and do some heavey thinking before they can find the cures. I hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad. If we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet @CAPS3 will stay around longer and we could make the a better place."

My first reason why I think computers are abenefit is because if you don't know about somthing and you wana learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some research on it. The best part is you can research anything even if its like a million miles away. The internet has imformation on anything and every thing. my second reason why, is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want. Its not just webcam either you can also go on facebook and other sites like that to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another. my last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. Their software on them to write, do projects, and plan things oct. plus most of the modern day society uses computers for stores and business's to keep track of things. Well thats why I think computers benefit us. I told you why I thought they did and how."

I believe that computers help our society. They give us more knowledge on whatever subject we want, it helps us connect to family far away places and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? @CAPS1 cousin lives in @LOCATION2 and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer. What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? In you get exercise and can expose the scenery. With a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep.

Weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. Computers are now a benificial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world. And learn about new things everyday. What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that. It's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. It could be online chatting and even sharing photos. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. If people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. And if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. And if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already I can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read I gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. And how I think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them."

You use computers to write, play games, look at pictures, and print work out. There are dozens @ORGANIZATION1 practical for computers but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage @ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity, expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time. Readers, hear my arguement and by the end @ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise nore or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also plenty @ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"". But do all these & exercise plans really work? According to a study done by the @ORGANIZATION1, the largest cause @ORGANIZATION1 obesity is actually computers! The students at @LOCATION1 had one group @ORGANIZATION1 people try a regular commercial diet plan & another group @ORGANIZATION1 people do exactly what they've been doing... Except their computers. They found that the group who from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 them computer. A familier day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use computer eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. Unfotunately, these happens @NUM1 days a week & the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time. Readers please, try avoiding you computers for just one week, and you can forget those jet plane. Another negative @ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION1 teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack @ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage. Teens become in their society lives and become to their computers. What they don't notize is that they're totally forgetting about their families! I know I've made the mistake @ORGANIZATION1 becoming too attached to socia networking to remember my family but luckily I have a stable family environment. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships, don't let that happen to you. Your children are without a doubt, through, the ones a by this technical revolution the most. From the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though. Children as young as @NUM2 or @NUM3 years old are exposed to profamily, & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sides"". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the @CAPS8's & emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without-even knowing. An enormous part @ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ORGANIZATION1 a young age. Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ORGANIZATION1 computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives. @CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @CAPS6? Faced with the concerns @ORGANIZATION1 lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise, separation @ORGANIZATION1 families & mappriate natural children do you really want your children, or even you for that matter, using a computer daily. Think a head @NUM4 years from @CAPS6. Will you say ""I wish I used my computer"" or ""I wish I spent more time"". In the end, the choice is really up to you."

Will I disagree with what you say. I think computer will help us learn, and do things faster. Haveing computers helps the community learn more. My first, reason I think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs. With the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of @LOCATION1 where they type every day and work hard. They also learn more and more facts about the sociatis. Without knowing how to type you @MONTH1 not get any top class jobs. My second, reason telling us that computers are helpful is that it helps your children do better in school by learning how to type for high school, and learning math, sce, social studies and language arts. Computers also helps kids at young age do math and other with their character, like dora, @ORGANIZATION1, elmo, and others. So learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time. Which i know your parents would like. Even new born babys can learn how to read, write and do math and grow up and can be president one day. My third, reason is that it helps send things all over the world. Without computers we would have to do it old fashion style. Also with computers you can talk to family member that live far away from you (In state or country) and you have not see them in a long time. Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day. You can also buy thing off the computer. In my conclution I told you that computers can not effect people by telling you that your child can do better learning and parents also. I also add that it helps you get jobs and help you with your hand and eye cordination in school and out. So computer help the community."

I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons."

So here I am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. How do you meet people from different countries? One way is interacting with different people all over the world. I am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. Another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? Well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. Do you know where your family comes from? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. For example, @LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. You can find this all out on the computer. Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family. I hope you understand this better."

Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be."

We have them at home, at @ORGANIZATION1 or at our work. Many people believe that computers are bad for our health or we don’t spend enough time with our family. But I disagree. Computers teach hand-eye coordination let us learn about faraway places, and also let us allow to chat online with other people. Have you ever had trouble with hand-eye coordination? Sometimes mine is ridiculous! But when i get on a computer it gets to be much better. Experts say that @PERCENT1 more people with hand-eye coordination have improved by working with computer. A teacher at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS1 students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand-eye coordination already."" I agree with these experts too. So many people nowadays that have a computer have passed their hand-eye coordination test! When I grow up and soon get out of high @ORGANIZATION1 I want to travel all over the world. But first I want to be educated on where I go. That is why computers are so helpful. I can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where I can learn all about the places I want to visit. @CAPS2 time @CAPS1 parents told me we were going to @LOCATION1 for the day. So the night before I did a bunch of research of different shops, museums, and places to eat. The computer helped me so much that if we didn't have @CAPS2 then i don't know where would go. President @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS2 time when i had a big meeting in @LOCATION3 I had no knowledge about it. So I logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture, language, and much more. I dont know what I would do if I didn't have a computer."" I love talking to @CAPS1 friends. But once I'm home none of @CAPS1 friends are around me, so I have nobody to talk to. If I also don't have the phone available then that makes it even worse.But, if I go on the computer then I can talk to bunch of @CAPS1 friends. I can go onto @CAPS1 webcam to see who I am talking to or I can go onto another website to get an instant message. I love talking online because ont of @CAPS1 best friends in the whole word moved down to @LOCATION2 so I don't get to talk to her too much. But if I go to the instant message website then I can talk to her as much as I want. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people sold in a survey that they have someone they talk to over the internet. So I say the computer is important in our society. It helps complete a number of tasks. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and it even allows people to talk to friends and family online. So I dont think computers are bad fo us or our health. I think they are important and needed."

Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION3 magazine, it stated that @PERCENT1 of people between the ages of @NUM1 and @NUM2 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since @DATE3, child obesity has increased by @PERCENT2! @PERSON2 of @ORGANIZATION1 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that “ the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @DATE1 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by @PERSON1 and his collegues at @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 spend almost @PERCENT3 more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In @DATE4 more than @PERCENT4 of family ate dinner together now, only @PERCENT5 eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. This also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don’t have the person to support and guide them because they don’t spend time together @CAPS4 to the frequent use of computers, there is a @PERCENT6 chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @PERCENT7 chance a child would in @DATE5. Do you want that for our youth? Now @CAPS1 a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @DATE2 of a family member. This happy thought won’t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?"

The myth is that computers ruin relationship between friends and family however, In some ways @CAPS1 improves them, when you go on skype you talk with some one online. By doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person. This information proves that computers can actually suport replationships.

My first reason for this is, a lot of kids have friends online that can't text or even talk on the phone, so this is another easier way to talk to them. Did you know that most kids communicate online now.

I believe they greatly benefit society. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate. Think about how life would be in the @DATE1 without computers. Different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources; such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. The computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it. It's as easy as that. Another benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to @LOCATION1 due to jobs. Thanks to internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them. Im sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messanger, or facebook, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convienent than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you. If we didn't have this connection with forgein countries, everyone’s lives would be different. Computers haven't just changed personal lives. They change the medical field too. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures. Computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis. This saves the lives of many people. @PERCENT1 of tests that have taken place to research a dicsease use a computer of some sort to break it down.

I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter! But you really can't tell people how long there allowed to spend on the computer you can only give an opinon and hope they listen."

I personnaly agree with th statement that computers benefit in society. I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her year of practice, she becamr very computer coordinated. My hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand-eye coordination practice ever."" @CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer, people can look up information on countries for pleasure too. Mu mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schoold too. My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states. Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back. I remeber I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said ""video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right inforn of them talking with them. These reasons are why I think computers are a big help in our society."

One main technilogical device that is popular is the computer. More and more people are using them, however, not everyone agrees that it benifits society. I believe that it does benifit us. One reason is that you can explore things at home. Before computers you would have to go to the library, find the book you need, and then search through it until you found the information you needed. Those things alone could take hours, especially if you don't live near on library. However, with computers you could just type it in on a search engine and find what your looking for. That could save you gas money because you don't have to drive anywhere. Another reason is that you can communicate online for free. Without a computer you would either have to go see that person by driving, talking on the phone, or texting, wich are all expensive. On the computer you have e-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many more. All of them you can communicate in different ways. If you want to look at pictures, take quizes, play games, or talk, thats @CAPS2. And finally for e-mail, you can send people letters videos, or you can just talk to other people by typing like all the others."

The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are too time consuming. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising. Now, lets talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends. Computers are very addicting, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them, though I can understand why certain individuals do it I dont think its right. I have many friends who would rather be on facebook or myspace than hang out with me. The web site listed above can really make you forget about reality. My friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend time on the computer all day. The reasons listed above tell you why I believe that computers should be taken away because of neglecting purpose. Now, lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users. i believe that time is a very valuable thing and you should not waste it. So when I read about people wasting time on the computer all day I, myself, was very upset! Statistics show that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours a day on average on the internet, statistics also show that the average aldut spends about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours on the computer a day on average. When I read the above statistics I came to grips with the fact that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing. Now, lets talk about exercising a bit more. I, myself, know that too much time is being spent on computers. By me knowing that I am aware of the fact that children are not exercising. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need it can cause health problems in the future,. Statistics show that around @PERCENT1 of children under @NUM4 years of age are obese. The above reasons tell you why I believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. Now, lets bring this letter to an end."

Madill (born 30 March 1829, Hunterstown, Pennsylvania) was a lawyer and U.S. Army Colonel during the American Civil War..Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that nature is better than spending way too much time in the computer? Well, generally speaking, I think it is and i'll give you only three reasons why. First of all, it's about the obesity percentage in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend a lot more time with your family. Finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer. Also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 are obese or overweighted. Last year in @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. Wow, the rate went went up like @PERCENT3 in each year. This info was online at www.tomatotalks.org. Another thing I would like to consider, spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing. All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere especially at the dinner table is a great way to talk about your child's problem's in school, and also to learn their parent's mistakes too. Also share great laugh's. Finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future. Last, but not least, you can enjoy the greater outdoors, and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about. Also trees that gives us oxygen too. Mother nature has it's great benefits when your career is all about science. Computers are educational but nature is better!"

You should agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. For example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. Also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. On computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. You can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. On computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. Also online you can watch movies and listen to music. Last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. Without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. I think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that we"

I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use @CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or @CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People sue @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they @MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people @MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them."

So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of the computer. Most of all @CAPS2 gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer just to chek @CAPS3 and facebook like I do but I just check my facebook and the go play basket ball.

Another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. People ignore their parents when on computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. If they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back. Now for my third reason. Third, People wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. On the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer go out with your friends, enjoy yourself."

Computers help use in many ways but the @NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information. So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings. First of all, computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be laying around every where @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages. Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish. Now I can talk to her and she can understand me. Finally computers help use get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records direction, etc. In the year @DATE1 people din't have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much fine on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends think about what computers do for us @CAPS1 think. So furher more computers benifit us a lot. There's storing deviced helping us get better a lot learning a forign language and getting information. So please make te right chose and think about what computers do for us. "

Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door.

The computer can help you get in contact with realitives you haven't seen in a long time.

So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease, and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and her on a medicine.

Having a computer can make you have lazy behavier, can @CAPS2 you from being indoors, and can @CAPS2 you inside so you dont hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will make you lazy. When your lazy or becoming lazy you dont want to do anything, and without doing anything you can become overweight. So, you need exersize because it's good for you and exersizing can protect you from health problems such @CAPS1 diebities. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature posses. Being so drawn to your computer can @CAPS2 you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When your outside you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for atleast an hour a day you'll see fore sure how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 you from what realy matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are realy important and if you don't spend time with them they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so dont spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun, I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, @CAPS2 you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least a hour a day they'll live a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer get off your couch, and enjoy your life."

Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter.You could go on diffrent websites to help you learn what your stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called a @ORGANIZATION1. It goes over on waht you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's @NUM1 @NUM1/2 years old. Isn't that amazing on that computers can do.

Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about @PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name and his biography came so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts you could type up papers and look up diffrent things you had to do in class.

There are maney resons as to why I beleve this. One reson is that it makes life easior, it also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers how would we talk with people without phones and spred news. Computers make life easior by maney ways. For example, if you needed a docters permition to play a sport, it would be alot easior to send him/her an email telling him/her to send you can email saying you can you can show it to the sports team and they will alow you to play. We can also lirn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and go to a news website and look at the wether so we can make plans for the day. We can find the newest technology ""I phone"" or ""@CAPS1 "". There are some people in the world that don't but have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the airfore and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't alow phones. Also if there is a pirson with good news and they want tell a lot of people send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I beleve computers are a good thing to have in new society. I have that they make life easyor. It also helps us understand our life today and it helps us talk to people around the world. I hope you agree on my topic."

It has helped mankind so much from buildings to new inventions. These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have.

In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and it benefits us. Except the fact about the games I agree with that bad side. I hope I have shown you as an independent person my statement was true."

My first reason is playing games. When you are bored and theres nothing to do all you can do is go on the computer and play all kinds of games like cars, shoting, arcade games to. You can do all this if you are bored or if you just want to go on the computer. My seacond reason is talking to freinds or famiely. If your brother or sister or any of your family members live in a different state and you want to talk to them or see them then all you got to do is ask them ""@CAPS2 is your email address and then if they got a myspace or facebook then you could talk to them as long as you want. You can also talk to your friends on those websites to. My thied reason is lisening to music. You can also lison music on your computer bu going to @CAPS3 or downloading frostwire or something like that. You can lison to all kinds of music like hip-hop, rap rock, or havey rock. If you want to lison to any song your going to need the song's name and something the artistes name to. This @CAPS2 I thinck they should put and @CAPS2 they should pick."

Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family? And always remember what the is."

Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?"

It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers."

For one, they help in our educational processes. They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new computers they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds. Also, in todays world, waiting is almost non-existant. Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow's future workforce, computers are in essential tool for us, and our children. One of the best things a lot this world is that we're all different, connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society. Conneticing through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us. But don't be fooled. It can also befor pleasure, say @CAPS3'son & buissness trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly, and steathily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is maraculous, and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be were we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research to day, than estatic common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have kemotherapy. Lets face it, computers are faster then us; way faster. But this is a god thing, because faster proccesing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its proccesing speed. It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist can not know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analize research, and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly that will extend our life exsentency, and who doesn't want you've larger's some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive, and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why don't you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's advention, connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world. So help the world help you, and go promote the use of computers across your community. It will only further advance us as a society in the end."

We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with.

For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computer are entertaning. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play videogames on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after @CAPS1 done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on facebook. You can just login and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computers to the other. My last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. People get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. These are my reasons that computers are good."

I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits."

Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, ""@CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?"", and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards."

Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up nig news & you needed to get it? Were did you turn to? I know not a book, but to the computer. Without it how were you going to get your info. I think computers are benefitial to our society because it can help you learn and it could tell you when or where to sign up for activities. People interact with others different countries, states, & or continents. Next, is how computer could benefit our society. Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge. For instance today my class & I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses. Without computers my class & I couldn't have get it done without the computers. If we had books, it wouldn't have been enough to give to us all & that would mean we would have to share. With sharing some kids @MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper, which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two. With computers we have enough for each kid in the class. And, computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker. With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter. Next, computer can help set up activities. Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help from the computers you don't waste time going to the gym signing up, while you could do it at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For instance my little brother plays baseball & my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sihn up, register, & pay. All of that could've been done online like my parents didnt with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge & able to sign up for activities. Do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are benefitial to our new up & coming society!"

They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits man-kind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the otherhand, Computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy to use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1 and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all purpose dictinary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like facebook, games websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrasination is very easy to give into. But self control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework, and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1-pound text book, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, excersising, and seing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landsacape. Self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this. I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer."

In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @CAPS2 one week can @CAPS5 your vision from a @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you keep it up now it @MONTH1 not seem bad but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer."

But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager. Most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is myspace and facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but comp. have webcames so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do with out a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family membere there are mosly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it. This is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a comp. is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice dont spend all!! Day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy your self in any way possible."

I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus @CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for @CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. @CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example @CAPS2 fast is like texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to @CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is @CAPS3 somewhat. All people should have a computer. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and @CAPS2 make life better."

People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse."

They can cause many problems in your life. When your on a computer, are you running? No, your just sitting there; using the computer involves very little movement. You need to be jumping around, dancing, walking with your friends, something! You can gain a lot of weight by sitting down and using the computer all day. Another problem that computers give you is being non social. You can get addicted to a game or something like facebook/@CAPS1 and be on there all the time. You wont talk to your friends as much at school or hang out with them because all you want to do is go on the computer. You are always thinking about just that and no other things in life. Computers can also be very dangerous. If you are on something where you are talking to people you don't know, they can find out things about you and can do to you. It's not at all to talk to people you don't know online. These are or the many problems computers cause. Trust me, I got addicted to a game before."

Kids now a days live on the computer. @PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer. Students should spend more time with their families, they should exercise more, and lastly focus more on their grades in school. My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families. All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day. This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @CAPS5 their parents do for them. For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday. In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school. Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ORGANIZATION1 do research. @PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @CAPS5 happen of the computer @TIME1. It's ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late. Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise. A famous baseball player once said ""you don not have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic."" @CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape. @PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise. The only exercise students get now a days is their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer. They need to get off the computer and do push ups, sit ups, and just exercise. For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile. To add on to the students need to pass there @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family, as well as focusing on their school grades, and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy!"

Some scientists have even studied the @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the time, the more you are online, the more likely chance you will become obiece. That is not what @LOCATION1 needs. You say you'll be on for a minute, but you will stay playing ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" for days on end. People with @CAPS3 work to do might never get on. Also it is just flat out a waste @MONEY1 time when you could be outside playing a @CAPS3 game. My second reason is that when you are ""chatting"" or ""@CAPS4'ing"" someone, who is it really? A study conducting proved that when you think your talking to a friends it is really some perverted @NUM1 year-old looking for ""fun."" @CAPS5 huh? Also when you talk, someone could be inbedding a virus in your system that could take @MONEY1 to fix. How mad would your parents be? It could be happening with every letter you press. Finally stranger or not, some @MONEY1 these people leave links to get to disgusting websites that you pray your parents don't see. My final point is that computers are proven to cause more stress. When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty fueds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damge to your grades. For every @NUM2 people when join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, afffecting their quality @MONEY1 work. In this economy I don't think we need more layoffs. Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get sucked in stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad."

Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communication with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students recieve a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are facebook, @CAPS1, and videochat. You could use facebook if you want to talk to friends or videochat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definately think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends. Computers are great."

Well myspace, facebook and aim is like a online hangout. Kids every where log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before. Sometimes the best thing to @CAPS1 is get some fresh air and interact with others. Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . Most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off. How you see how computers have a major effect on people by not interacting with others, not having enough, and kids wife sneaky and will go on other website, they wer not allowed to go on and if thier parents wernt home."

This is true because computers help people with things hand eye coordination to learning advances to our schools finally it helps people communicate with ease, @CAPS7 plase consider the following. First of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using ther hands and eyes together. @ORGANIZATION1 ullodhers from @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1 ""Computers help hand eye coordination @PERCENT1 more than putting your son or daughter on the football team"" @CAPS8 computer games could help kids get more acurate with there skills or that of any sport. @CAPS7 now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination. Secondly Computers help people learn new things. Although people might think to be false it is indeed true. @ORGANIZATION1 a recent study at @ORGANIZATION2 shows that @PERCENT2 of schools in @CAPS6 use computers for research.Finally recently had a paper about @PERSON2 and The only scorce I thought of was wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. @CAPS7 now you understand the computer is a helpful learning tests. Finally the computer is a great way to communicate online. It is better than @CAPS10 because it is faster and more than calling someone up and talking for. @CAPS8 it is alot cheper than @CAPS10 because you just have @NUM1 payment a-month unlike phone. Where it starts to add up. Inract @PERSON1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 of @LOCATION1 in a recent study that ""@CAPS10 are absolete now, with the internet peope can chat at lignning speed"". Finally using e-mail or facebook is @CAPS7 much better than phone tag on facebook you know where you can chat with. @CAPS7 thats my reasons that the computer is good for communicating. @CAPS7 now you see that computers are nessecery because they develop hand eye coordination, they @CAPS8 help people learn and finally they are a great way to communicate."

I think that you can never spend enuf time on the computer it feel there is no bad effet computors can have on you they only improve your life is why. For one thing if you need to find out a important fact date or time. You can just look it up on the computor. The internt is a never ending sorce of knolage and you can learn just about any thing that you need to know just by searching it on the computor.Another usefull thing the computor dose is the ability to talk to people useing eother @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 or that rooms you can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relitive on the computor and you can even hook up a web camera and actuly see theam as they talk to you something a phone cannot do. Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up. And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had. And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real. Now I have mentioned some of the many thing why you can never spend enuf time on the computer shure exersise and nator can be helth but you can do only of that stuff I just mentond by takeing a nator walk so wont you agree computors improve our life more then they are unhealthy."

I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @CAPS1 side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has @CAPS2, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The goof of is you can get those chorse. Oh not that make me to. @CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. @CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. Excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many shore. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend, ""yo sup man,"" ""not, you"" ""not much, just fiding around for some exercise"" ""same here, same here"" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @CAPS1 friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. Like i said be what was @CAPS1 friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So @CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love @CAPS1 family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @CAPS3 time with family and friends."

Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health."

The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. ""But"" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!"

Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting, without exercise and aren't nessasary."

Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat thier friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer."

So I belive that these atroshish things should bery well be disposed of. There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing.

Lastly @PERCENT3 of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads imagene all the lives that could be saved if they just went to breath every @NUM3 minets I mean on average @NUM4 hours a day your looking at a @CAPS2 take time off make a goal for say @NUM5 hours.

Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people ""skype"" on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new ""social networking series"" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways."

Every where you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, I happen to disagree, I feel that the computer is a great @CAPS5 to put out and find information. I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society."

Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 ""isn't that great""!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt "

There should be a law that people has to go out and exercise before and after then use compiuters finally, I think that childrens should use the compiuter less than the adult fee health reasons. @CAPS1 first oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should make timers added to the compiuters to time tha amount of tim people should take depending on what they are doing like when some one is playing a game they spend hours playin instead of doing a diffrent activity. Also like when a person is doing their home work they start getting carried away in taking their time going slow and ends up finishing very bad. @CAPS1 second oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have a law that people has to go out and exersise before and after they use compiuter because there is a big percentage amount of people who are obeast because everyone sits in the sits in the compiuters and starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours and they dont take a break to go outside and @CAPS1 third and final oppinion that I think that those who makes compiuters should have childrens use the compiuter less than the adults for health reason's because kids are always looking at the compiuters an their eyes are always getting red and then they start to not being able to see as well as they used to then they end up having to need glasses or abetter perpscription glasses. Also becaus kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people who they dont know so they end up getting raped or kidnapped by the person that they went to talked to for hours. So local news paper will you make that change for the society and for the childrens? Because I would!"

We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most imfortant thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time,"

Computers a very good effect on our town's specify. Computers areaids in tracking hand-eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things & talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty. Let me explain more these reasons. Computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand-eye coordination to kids & adults. Just to help you understand why in to teach hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you. In foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself. In baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill, but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone & hurt them, ability to day back. Computers are great way to this skill in a saw Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to do have a good our town? Well, computers let people to that. You can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have I do have another reason. Computers have to samethings electronically so fast easily, make a look on computer's hard drives, @CAPS2 are so much more that ran be on a computer, that make a room empty. Before my famiy had a computer complete dedicated to papers files that your so important & that we could not lose. When up got picture, typed up paper, saved our was empty!

They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I agree. While people use the computers, they don’t interact and meet new friends in person. They stay inside and don't get excersise, and kids might talk with strangers. When we use computers we chat with friends online and don't really interact with others. We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize, so that is one disadvantage of a computer. Another problem is lack of exercise. While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise. Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy. Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers. Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info. Kids might even meet with some of the strangers they talked to online and get hurt! well thank you for reading my opinions about computers. I hope you take them into consideration. Kids and even adults dont interact with freinds, lack exercise, and give personal information to strangers."

You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family."

The way i look at it as i see is that to much is bad so i think spending some time on it is good do you agree?"

After that happened, @CAPS7 went to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport @CAPS7 plays. Next people aren't spending enough time with their families.

Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun."

It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace.

I went on youtube and type in""nike sb skate lair demo"" and clicked on it. i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face! i was so exited. Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount."

In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business of work related. But then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day. What they could be doing is enjoying life. Going outside and getting fresh air. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites. Such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are obsessed so thoes are teo websites that are very addicting to some people. and then these are the people who just like looking things up. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. And use the computer only when you need to. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment. But all things are good in moderation. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers. So thank you for listening."

Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today."

I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?"

The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers."

However, believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise, In @CAPS21 perspective. I can agree, with there, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computer on @CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?"" that is where students can got their @CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many shops like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a catolog online, where you and effenly. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and @CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily. These are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many @CAPS16 you can play, like @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14-@CAPS15 @CAPS16) I play many of these, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17. I love these @CAPS16 because they are very amusing world. You watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via @CAPS18. @CAPS18 is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. A @CAPS18 video is ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22,"" a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored. I can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @CAPS16 called @CAPS23. With this, you can play many fun @CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science. In @CAPS21 science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motion/gravity. You can also conduct research on the web, you with many projects. I know I use the web to with almost every project I have."

This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day."

I disagree, because is your on the computer all day you'll forget bout things. For example, you will forget to exercise, you will forget nature, you will also forget to interact with your friends and family. I promise you if you keep on reading you will understand and realize my point of view. People soend to much time on the computer, and they don't exercise like they should. Exerising is very important, that helps you with . Exercising helps you grow. it makes you stronger. If your on the computer all day then, you'll exercise and develop right. Another reason, I think its such a lead idea is you do not get to enjoy nature. When your on your computer you can not go on an hike in the woods. You can not go on camping trip. You can not do the thing, in the pleasant air of nature. The last reason but defenitly not the least you will forget to interact with your friends and family. That is so important because a computer could do a lot. It could teach you a lot but it canot do it you and @MONTH1 I love you. Only youre family and friends could do that. Hopfully you under and realize my point of view. People should stop doing this you forget to exercise nature and to spend time with you friends and family. All I got to now thank you for the oppurtunity to listen to my idea."

People shouldn't spend so much time. They wont enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that its bad for their health. Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes. Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out. Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body. To me thats very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. On the computer all the time can make you forget to spend time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and how are you to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ingnore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your soical activitys with other people. My final reason why spending to much time on the computer is bad is that your not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself. Being on the computer to much will make you not want to exerise and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new thing. You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it. Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad. Its not health. You don't interact will your friends or family. Also you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you."

What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, @PERSON2 had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children's computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""@CAPS3"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person , only through technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I @CAPS6 urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today."

Even though I think it has both effects on peope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that atleast @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. Thank you for your time."

The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I beleive this is not somthing to be excited about. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. The ove useage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure. Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healty, only use the computer when it's absolutely neccesary. Going on all the time can seperate you from others. This g eneration, adolecents especailly, use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family. Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can became a non-important thing. People can't pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing, even nature. Humans started out living i nthe wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting. Our connection with nature was strong. We needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People do not appreciated nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1. com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when neccesary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside."

I picture it as a better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world better. Computers @MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer having computers or no? In my opinion people would be better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers is one factor to blame with the @LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy. If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in @LOCATION2 will as well. If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 says ""if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them"" @CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue. In my opinion the citizens of @LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their. more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly when your on your computer all day you don't realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals. Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more, computer should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer. @CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least your social life could improve if people werent on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would be better off without computers. I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise, enjoy for nature, also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from. There is no need for a computer in your life, but don't speak for everyone. The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good."

Now I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers. @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever. Thats good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them. Another reason why is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing their is, is that you learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future. For example @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot. Now where going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted. For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I'm not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad things is viruses. My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus it sucks you cant do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family. I know some people who do that like its not cool if company comes over get off the computer. Since I dont have much time left I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer. Thats what I think you should for now."

I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @CAPS1 society should have computers. First, we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before. I say this because if you wanna know about the @LOCATION1 more and the school or job doesn't teach you as much as you wanna know, then all you have to do is look up on the internet and theres a chance you gonna find it. @NUM1 people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 society because we could contact people online that we heven't spoke to. My opinion is that if you haven't to a friend or family member in a while you can talk to them online. Also, if they don't have a phone or if they do but it's long distance and you can't talk to long distance on your phone, you can tlak to them on or email each other, etc. Sample say if your phone isn't working and the only thing that's working is your computer you to it in contact with somebody. All you gotta do is talk to them online. Would you rather talk on the phone or computer. In conclusion, @CAPS1 society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people. I would like for you to aprreciate my concern on having computers in @CAPS1 society."

I don’t think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldn’t you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldn’t get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldn’t get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society."

They can help contact friends and family from all over the world. You might need it for typing a paper for school or work, and you can use the internet. If you had a friend or family member move away, computers are an easy way to contact them. Phones dont always give you that option to call from around the world. Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers. What if you want to chat with someone right next door even if theres a blizzard and the snow is four feet, computers are a simple way to contact them. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 for the @DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her. Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay. Do you really want to write it all? Imagine you, writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday. Typing is an easy solution that doesnt require as much work and it takes less time. Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read. Not even a library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library wont immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully? You cant expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldnt take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane, train, boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you cant go over to the store or airport. You can go online to purchase tickets. Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 it upon google"" when they dont know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog, I never even heard of. When I got home I went on the internet and researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and its fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper."

First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games practicingg these they will just computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done. WIthout even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college those things include getting out around, but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends. i went over my I sat right and she didn't even look at me playing computer games. i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer. Lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them. It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because, they are absorbent in they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're budy playing game or surfing the web. i know that if I did I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because, it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people, as much, and it distract them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less those on the computer!"

Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change."

Is someone a trip to a country that they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could have them find afordable flights or a hotel to stay at.

You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events. any costs.

Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier, and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone.

School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page.

So that is why computers benifet people. @CAPS1 first reason is that a computer can help people when they need help like for instace if you have to write a paper and you need to look something up such as reseach you can use the computer or if there is a long main cwayshion then you can look up the formula. So as you can see that is why computer benifts people @CAPS1 second resson is that it gives people entertainment, such as myspace, you twitter. And those are social networks, if you like to watch tv. or listen to music there are websites for them also. So that is why I said computers give you entertainmen too. @CAPS1 third resson is that it helps people such as if you in different contries and you can't go see them you to them through instans or web cam. Or if you are home schooled and you dnt see other kids your age that can talk to the on the computer. So as you can see that why I say you can through the computer. So as you can see that is why I say computer are very benifical be cause they give you entertainment they let you communicate and they help people so."

Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. ""You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond. (did not finish)"

Maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. For others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. The computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a @NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, @ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw. So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curiouse about the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2, if I wanted more inofrmartion @CAPS3 head straight to the computer. You simply go to @ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty. The computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways, wether it is communication organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life. Computers don't just benifit our little town of @LOCATION1, they benifit our whole socoety in all of the amazing things they do. "

Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online."

I belive people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death. First of all there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer to much. When they are out with their family they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a non-stop amount of time. In a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say, ""I had one child come into @CAPS3 office and he had the hardest time seeing"". He asked the kids mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, ""@CAPS3 son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses aare really expensive. I have read about children and adults deing from using the computer to much. They have fried their brain from using the computer to much. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking in homes, killing people, and high sacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you trun your computer off so that you are not temted to go back on it."

Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computer allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also website such as mapquest & yellowpages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleages instantly. What one does, is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are ease for our everyday life. So, don't spent your life on the computer but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine. Stop writing on that pad, get up and type it on your computer!"

That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In @DATE1's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionaly, at the rate that technology is advances, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the @LOCATION1. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time consuming and, thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers just simply are a hassle in @DATE1's world."

I think that this is great. The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand-eye coordination, it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and it also allows people to talk online with other people. Keep reading to find out more. The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand-eye coordination, for example, there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers. You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard. Keep reading for more information. The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country, you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general. You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people. You can look up people like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's to @PERSON2 who is our presiden now. Keep reading for more information. The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, you could set up and account on facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start talking to people. You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew. Keep reading to find out more. Lastly, I think that more and more people are using computers is agreat thing. They can learn hand-eye coordination, have the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to other people online. I talked to the people who have just started to use computers and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they had liked what they had seen. So, I want you to go out there and get a computer and see what you think about it. Thank you."

You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!"

Teacher have troble reading other hand writing so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper & now it will be very helpful. The near by libarry will always have extra computers students can use to write a papper.

Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?"

Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your motabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone. Even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights. Many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a survey an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and about an hour with family. The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind, ask your self how useful the computer really is. Sure it's good at researching things quickly but its also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glassses and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all."

As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more."

These people can do other things like excersising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy.

Every years my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dash, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to @DATE2 then my dad does another assment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excersises are bench pressing, squating, and dumbell curles. There are more challenging excersise but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that trainign and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrls to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excersise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their families insted of being on the computer @NUM1."

In against it and ill you why. You spend less time exercising which you'll gain weight. Spend less time enjoying nature which means youre lost with anything natural, an spend less time with friends and family which probbaly prove you, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 not saying the computer is a bad thing but to much of it certaintly is. First, you spend less time exercising. you don't exrcise you gain weight, you could do most of the stuff you could of , and you risk health. This is a bad thing because your not yourself anymore and if it goes to far you can't even a move. So if this sounds scary plan your time on the computer, so it doesn't happen to you, time is so limited that we waste it on stuff in computers so think before you go on the computer maybe you can go for a jog outside. Next, you spend less time playing nature. Nature is so beautiful but its being destroyed and we do nothing. There are only a few hundred maybe they said of us these truly help the environment, and if you think then few hundred of thousand people is alot . @NUM1.billion people of earth. Its a crying shame to see something so beautiful die, while most of us do nothing to help. Finaly, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most important reason of all. The main course if you will of it all your family is so important because there your best friends whole wide world. Your friends important them. Your family might leave you if you your life to the computer if you they you so be carfully. Your friends are dust as important as your friends they both make you laugh. have good times and cheer you up when you upset. Just don't forget that as be gone. Well, there you have it my three reasons for being against work on the computer and they all sound like a good reasons so lets recap it all shall we. First, spend less time exersing, very important. Next spend less time enjoying nature, very important. Finaly less time with friends or family the most important of all. So hoped you enjoyed my essay and you've learned something . So remember to much of good thing is bad and I'll just leave you with . "

This is completly untrue and in many ways actually benerfits society. The internet is d fast d simple way to shorten the time spent doing activites we would already do. Instead of sending d letter to someone to invite them to the @CAPS3 you could just email them. Letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly.

Well if you think it is negative I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand-eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see this is why I believe it is positive. First, computers teach good hand-eye coordination. While you use computers you are improving your hand-eye coordination. One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger, you move the mouse and click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely. As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive. Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @CAPS7 is great. You can send people @CAPS3 or even @CAPS4 chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone. Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could @CAPS2 projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being @CAPS5, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @CAPS5 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the @CAPS7. As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive. In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand-eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all. In fact the are the best bet for a better future."

Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing."

Computers can help people with schoolwork, communication and entertain you in a safe way. Those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world. First of all, computers help with a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world-wide-web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can't find in books. In addition if a student forgets, losses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be @CAPS1 neat @CAPS1 possible. That is hard for some students,  typing it is neat, and everyone can do it. @CAPS1 you can see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are a great way to communicate and keep-in-touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send some thing to him, he could easily e-mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, the could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up an conference, the teacher could e-mail the parent a time and date. That is why computers are great can easy communication. Lastley, computers provide a safe, fun way or entertainment. Many companies make kid-friendly websites that  go on. For instance, my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kindergardeners who go on these websites, do better in first grade compared to those who don't computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide east communication, and provide safe educational activities, @CAPS1 you can see, computers are a great addition to our world."

Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, ect. I could just go onto a computer open or download a program a there it is. Computers also help people express there creativity by here a program that aloose you to draw or biuld. I bet the even help young children became smarter by biulding things on the computer. Another things computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad econimy people need all the help they can get. With a computer you can keep people alive and bretheing you can find broken bones or tomors, you can biuld briges, homes by making blue prints. The last thing computers help us do is the most importen and that is helps people learn. By making simulation of the titanic a space ships or the floor. They help find information even if its about people you can see people on a computer with a camra for or save a life by fing were they crased on there plane or. Thats why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advance and smarter."

There are threes big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and arent spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people arent getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day. People would gain weight might ever get dabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten tov used to all the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk, with friends. People should al least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. So this is why I think this is bad for the societys benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart. Thank you!"

Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. My neibor, who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. So I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad.That is why computers have a negative effect on our society."

Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you dont even need a keyboard. Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. We'll computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the vireses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parcore. Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They to, might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a buisness that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more.If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us suesede is great."

Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure."

I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can't forget the work of @CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant say @CAPS2, but, if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese. Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast, free, and gorgeous? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact that over three of the information in isnt reliable therefore. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use to. These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become less obese and if that's not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11.

The lost and probably most negative effect is the exesive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is probably are one of the most important thing to live along and healthy life. People should be atleast taking along walk everyday. If people are sitting infront of a all day there will be much moreover people. People shold be for healthy life style, not with computers around every corner. People are also losing the ability to interact. Life is becoming dull. Every one is either texting someone.

If someone think there inlove and when the cople meets the dont know how to interact, then there is a real problems. Even when you are just on the computer. You could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the emerce amount of freedom that any are has with computers. There are lots of bullies people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like facebook, but they're not cairful. They put staff like there adress and don't pay attention who how is sending them friend request. Computers have way to much negative effectson people. It would be great if some how the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should wont to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just dont let computers control your life."

I'm sure if you was around my age you know how fun it is to explore the internet. It's a brain tht gives you information about everything. But, it’s not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer. Things like exercise, socializing and homework matter. If you don't exercise you begin to gain weight, if you don't socialize you'll be an lonely person. Homework is the most important, because it'll help you really well through life. It's fine to go on the computer time to time, but not for hours. Exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports, you should jog a couple times of day. Some people make you feel bad if your bigger than they are. For example, I knew someone who was a little big for his age, but people didn't like him and they always made fun of him. I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer. Do you have ant friends? Or did all of them leave you because you wouldn't stop surfinh the web on your computer. As a teenager you should be socializing with your friend at the movies, arcaded and parties. Not in the house on the computer. Especially with your family, because you never know if they're going shopping for you ask me that's selfishness. Every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades? Education is the most important thing you need in your life. Without it you can't be or do anthing, because you wouldn't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job how can you pay for electrity bill for your computer? Education can get anywhere, if you want it. If not you can be a homeless guy in the street holding a computer that doesn't work. Do you still think this has a positive effect on people? You should talk to parents about getting their child an computer. For example, tell the parent to put a password that only she/he knows, that way he has to ask you to sign onto it everytime we needs it. Blocks off things that you think is important for your child., especially if your child is into sex. That is why I don't think it gives people the right kind effect they might need."

An if you read this you would see my reasons why. One of them will be about exercising. The two others will be about your friends and family. So read my reasons and by the end I hope I made my point. All right like I said first we will talk about what the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer. Did you know that from being on the computer all the time you lose focus on exercising anymore? Of you eating an @CAPS1 not exercising, because your worried about the computer. The weight that you put on you know just doesn't burn off by themselves. So by you not burning off that fat you just keep gaining and gaining. By the time you know it you'll be over weigh and wish you didn't spend all that time on that computer. How that I'm explaining about your of exercise. Where going to talk about your you bring on the computer all you would with your family. For example your family would want to go out but you say no because of that computer @CAPS1 parents would @CAPS1 they would because your lack of communication with the family. I've got my two reasons across let me get my third. Of you bing on that computer you have been adicted, but you just don't lose contact with family, but also with friends. You loving that computer so much you probably quite all your like the basketball, softball, and more teams because you thought it took to much of your computer time. In the end you would lose probably alot of frienships. @CAPS1 your boyfriend or girlfriend would dump you. So now that you read this I hope I got my point out to you, about what a computer can do to you in the end."

My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they dont have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they dont have to pay. All you could do is download it. And also thre are many websites of movies. My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer. teenagers are teenagers they must have technology. If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they wont do it same will. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if its a laptop. This is my opion on the effects computers have on people."

The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need."

The three reasons I think this, is because computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic. They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand-eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want in to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you started stumbling and acting clumsy, then you @MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing. This is why hand-eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, In fifth grade I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer. I would have never been able to learn evrything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the help on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years. Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand-eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today."

I sure hope you don't! They are saying that computers are health risks because to many people are on them and not exercising, well if you risk me the users should know when to stop. And well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits. Also computers are very convient, if you need information on a topic right away. So there far I think computers are not the one's at, in this perdevment. Exercising is somthing a perosn should have the ambition to do. @MONTH1 people don't have this they spend their day on the computer. they claim its not their faut. the computer is a you to play it. I read just last week that someone actolly told her press they it is not fault her over weight. Thats ! So the only person at full. for not getting the the gamer. As us family interaction goes, all up to the parents the use the parents are in control over they child and if they are that their kid doesn't spend enough time. The operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits!. If we didn't have computers at home it would be a. Kids relie on computer them quick, accurate information. With not them the parents should their child to and from the library, and the time. And lets not forget the internet easy. So in conclusion computers are the way to go they are not the cause or however luck of exrcising at fault. Its not the computers fault familys. And they are just so convenit so clearly computer are good to have! I truly hope by the letter you agree with my oppinion."

One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors."

In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs.

They're very helpful and entertaining. For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. ""I love facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have facebook, skype, or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also. Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. ""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play cards, chess, pinball or game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch videos, or much much more. ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com,"" says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll. I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @CAPS1 everyday for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is one of the most important things in the average home."

Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its abiliyt to show websites containing rast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someonehas? Well, people who use computers are drown into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time infront of a computer screen don't inteact as much with friends and family as they nirmally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a dnager to the children. In order to help the wee-being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If oyu were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely someone enjoying the outdoorss. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or fotbol, or playing frisbee, @CAPS2 who do this rather than sit inside staring ata computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well. when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the feild to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, freshing water in the pool. Not to mentio, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding. @CAPS2 need tog et out and chair, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also . ahve you ever gone gone home and just retreat to your room for some quite? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""@CAPS3 is ready, a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfer with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a tence like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come toigether they separate them. This vcreates and unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours! This pretty much takes up a lot of time, so families can't spend time with one another. One important problem that children and teens face are @CAPS2 oover the intenet are people known as ""child predators."" @CAPS4 people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter @CAPS4 ""child predators; would you want to see your child be hurt by @CAPS4 horrible people? Computers are the reason, a with the internet for @CAPS4 accurances. Children and teens need to be protected from this major threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and thier lives. First, they don't allow people to be active and go outside. "

Worrall (University of Texas at Dallas)..Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing."

But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to @CAPS2.com and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in @LOCATION1 then all this @CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'@CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'@CAPS3 do none of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people."

I think that computer help in many different ways. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, helps us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about @CAPS1 you computer can help you phisicly? Many parents state that, ""@CAPS2 spend to much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is teaching them hand-eye cordination. Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer, but if they do sertain things to limit the @CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games, limiting there time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly. What is you method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you arn't at school, or have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what yo need to know? Well, with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to you local library to a book, @CAPS1 would you learn? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at home jobs today require computers, and without the computers the job would not be getting done. This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one are? Probably not this is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me heep in tuch with old friends."

Computers are helpful on finding information, making your work less difficult. But at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family. Computers have so much information that the news paper in the future will no longer be known. Newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch. Because of computers instead of getting info of what happen yesterday in what area you live with the computer you can find out what intersting things happen yesterday in the whole world. But thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project. About as an example cells and with that computer it will help a lot more than you think no need to write all slopy just type of cell's were you can find in the internet, print done it just makes life way easier than just writing drawing finding info of cells in book that waste good time to go outside and play with friends and family. Computer like I said are sometimes bad like people and it also like a drug. Because look at computers when people go on website like, myspace, twitter, facebook, communicating website or game website, theres whay to much to name. Its a drug cause you to stay on it day to night you'll get stuck to it and can't get enough of it and some people won't stop and it hurts there family, friend and especially health, like drugs they cause all the same thing. I think I proved my point of why computers are sometimes bad and sometimes good like people."

I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today over use that power. You know what I mean @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts. Or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. People like the @CAPS4 do not spend much time with family members, or friends, or even just outside. They do not get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, physically or socially. Some people are working all day, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so that they rarely spend time with those they love. But if you are hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @MONTH1 just not spend enough time with family and friends. Using a computer isn't exactly a social thing. One person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. You @MONTH1 say ""@CAPS5, but there are also online social networks."" @CAPS5, but how often do you even see those people in real life? Computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. That certainly does not benefit society. A major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors. So you cannot be online chatting, or playing a game, or checking your email, outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. Sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors? Computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not well. That is the reason why pine tree's don't have outlets (although now you never know what they'll do next). Another side effect - that goes allong with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise. Once again, it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. When you live as a computer vegetable, your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be. Another reason computers could lower your quality of life. Now, really, if you use the computer sparingly, and only when you needed to, or when it is nessecary you would really have none at these ""side effects."" But face it, the ruth is, computers can be addicting. Wether it's waiting for a friend to come online or your trying to get to level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"", they can get you hooked. The idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers, but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting-springly. So, now you know, computers when used to much, at obsesive amounts, are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting. As long as you use them correctly, they are a very, very valuable tool to be used, but over used, can be problem causing, and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends, getting exercise and even spending time outdoors. I know you certainly will agree."

Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. Therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. For example me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. If we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. Plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. My where you add up and subtract and divide. It's alot less words if you use a computer."

They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers."

They are also good because they help to develop cordination on your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. First of all I think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other county or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. You can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls. Secondly the computers are helpful because they help you cordinate your hand and your eye. This helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; You will be able to finish it on time. From your point of view you can actually se were I'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. The hand cordination can help you develop mentally sight. Thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy thing like a clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online. In conclusion I think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to cordinate body parts don't you agree with me?"

They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. Our teacher also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research. For example, last week in social students I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to @ORGANIZATION1- on the and sound a storage of information on the @NUM1 for my project on wehter capital punishment is and unusual. I found from this database that not onlt is it all lawed for that reason but the @LOCATION1 got from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which is instanly to carry the newest. most recent information I would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact. It would mre costly taken over two houses just to find the same information that five minutes using a computer. The internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method. As well as for research, school use computers to type papers. This moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check. Also, using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers. E-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are just @NUM2 of the commnly used websites on computers they make talking to friends and family easier and faster then ever. Last @DATE1 my friend on a business trip the was for @NUM3 weeks she missed him a lot @CAPS4 mom let @CAPS4 she was able to would have a telephone call. It consoled @CAPS4 for the @NUM4 days wasn't able to see @CAPS4 while still being amazing quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before. It is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them we don't need to worry about learning in life. Also in the closer future computer will be used in high school and college for helping paper researching and morw it will be faster and easier for us it we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventualy if can read the benefits are counters. As you can see, computers and the internet can any benefits iur society school can use them for many projects and learning People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face to face finally, it can help run the future. In conclusion compare use be encouraged."

Computers have on people. In the past, everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 agree computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination. Dr. @DR1 expert in relationship to humans said, ""People without computers cant do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination. The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. when you can't look up and learn about places, you are not about them. You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friend ships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures.

Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom @PERSON1 was a size six in the waist. @PERSON1 would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. @PERSON1 quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (computer game) and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. @PERSON1 is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad @PERSON4. When @PERSON4 gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, @PERSON3 became a member of @CAPS4 @CAPS2, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when @PERSON3 was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, @CAPS7 take my suggestion seriously and bann computers."

Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs @NUM1 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer @NUM2 its bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go me go on the computer, but she @CAPS1 makes me go outside and run around @CAPS1 people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger chilld the wrong ideas. For example I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad peole post videos and the little children could see then and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time and with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad."

Most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them. No matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eys off the screen. Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isnt' all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicans put together. If you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plety of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing whats going on. Do you like to stay organizes I personally, think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do.

Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves. This is why I think that comperters aren't positive in society."

I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work. Overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer. But, some times it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1. Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line. Also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @CAPS1. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @CAPS3 be bullyed at their safe place, their home. Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise. A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said ""every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers."" @CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. Lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students. Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend to much time all the computer. I was waching discovery chanel and it said that @CAPS3 most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework. The computer made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!"

Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. It also helps you with your work. Never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decition that you want to make."

The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had recived information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to comunicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remeber my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the . Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2-obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and excersising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they myt entertain themselves indeers. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privleges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormouse benifits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students whith school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside. I hope that this letter had convinced you of the benefits of computers."

I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone."

Computers are very helpful now, mostly every thing gets done on it. The computer teaches good eye cordination, how to focus, and show you stuff you don't know about. Without an computer you really can't get any thing done or reddy. A computer can be helpful for lots of things like job aplications of taxe's, or at a grocry store register, typeing and being on the computer is exercising but not for your body. When your on a computer exercise your hand's and your brains. With out computers you really cant do any thing. Mostly everything you do in life have to deal with some type of computer. I think that the people that said they shouldnt be on the computer is wrong because they can interact with there family that's far away thats also on the. You can enjoy nature by just takeing a look old you don't have to walkt out. Thats why I think computers are positive and helpful."

Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefits the society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and it teaches people hand-eye coordination. Computers are changing the world throughout everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. That gives you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of @CAPS1 that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than none. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the @LOCATION1 has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school I know that from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study in a quiz or test, I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer know that it benefits our society. Computers teach hand-eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That's because with all the and websites it will teach us hand-eye coordination with I'm just having fun. Ninety-five percent of people who use the computer enjoy to use it. That's ninety-five percent of people who are learning more hand-eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, than nothing does. As I have shown, computers deffinitly do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because it gives people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand-eye coordination. In conclusion, computers have a strong effect on people today."

Although, people are now starting that these handy desktops are bad for your well-being oposing that people strongly think that we dont get enough exercise or outdoor activitys in. Well computers are such a great entertainment system also, have a vast information supplie, and even allow socialization with friends/ family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 payers are no match for the internet and it's great wide spread entertainment system. The computer has all of the faimly fun movies, itunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse. The internet is the obvious best reason for a faimly movie night. One of the greatest pro about the internet is the vividsorce of information. Google, wikipedia, or even dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the @DATE1. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun I would rather learn about a sunny beach of @CAPS2 or the great landscape of @LOCATION1. If your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the @CAPS3 is a sure easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in @LOCATION2 or germany. The answer is simple, skype, fiacebook, myspace and more are all available on your handy @CAPS3. Many sites have a no fee polocy so they cant charge them money for social living with friends. As a personal experience I could now talk to my cousins wqho live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 due to the great interaction site of facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that thier even there. Obviously internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends. I'm people will open thier eyes see the great uses of the computer."

One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community."

Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination.For another, they are a great means of communication.Finally they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more conected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as uch as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5., and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one."

I believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back. I believe this because. First of all, computer bring about online communication. Also computers advance and enhance learning, had to mention that computers advance emloyment. As I mentioned, computers bring about online communications. Now after reading this there must be one side running thru your head define this well online communication, include social networkinjg sites litre facebook and twitter and not to forget my space. This also includes email and blogs and some chat sites. Okay enough of that But how do these things inventions iprove our lives. These inventions allow long distance communication bringing people ""closer together."" @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And thru facebook, my mother can speak with him any time she wishes and over from their relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 be very nessary @CAPS1 same. Also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication. Besides, I mentioned learinig. Computers can improve learning in a variety of ways. Computers improve learning because they speed the flow of information to the students can go to such places and a school websites to findout more on a particular occuring at the school. @CAPS1 example, I go on my school's website to retreve nightly homewrok assignments and read the next day's daily annocments. Teachers might post helpfel hints on homework and @MONTH1 a detailed explanation of the assignment. Also computers can improve learning by assiting with research projects @CAPS1 example a couple of weeks ago my health class was information car our illegal drug project. So with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it."

People who are sitting on the computer are not getting exercise or seeing beautiful nature. Do you want to get fat sitting next to a metal box? People are also not visiting friends and family and those are the most important. People in your life. Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer. All of the cool, fit people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of the cool people and go outside and have yourself a ban looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals. You can do both of those with your friends and family while sitting on your computer you don't see them as much @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends and I bet you are one of them. Friends and family can also help you get through hard times without them whi knows wgere you would be in life. So do yourself a favor get off the computer, and go visit some really great people. Its now or neve to get off that computer or your family and friends are going to leave you and you are going to get fat on top of that. Do you want to be that person? You are also going to miss out on the beauty of nature. So go, go, go, have yourself some fun."

So many uses for the computer. But creators of the computer are worried that people are spending to much time on the computer. Mainly its about conserners and users, most of those people complain that their having no time with their family and friends. You never know if the users are looking up vacation trips for both friends and familys. The things that conserners dont get is that the computer can teach you alot of things, history, mathmatics, science experiments and many more. Computers are also used in schools to help students with their work, even teachers use the computer for grades. It is true about people not going outside geting some fresh air or even taking a walk in the park. They cant keep themselfs on the computer for like @NUM1 hours, its just crazy. So i would go with both sides. Its just better to enjoy life then just look up things that you dont really need to. You should only need to go on like paying bills, and furneture for your house. Thats why the computer was invented."

That's what the world would be like if computers just discapeared. I think computers are more benefical to society then some people relize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an acountend. Computer games and @CAPS2 help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teen how to become sucessful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now acess grades in a heartbeat. My computer helps me."

For example, there's better communication with friends and family, you get instant news on any topic, and you get advanced education. Imagine if no important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries the person no contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a facebook, or other interacting werbsites, you know what's going on in your friends life all the time without having the to by reaching them all the to see how they are doing. Every adult watching the news at night before they go to bed to see what has @CAPS2, what if you went to bed early. How would you know what happened? That's when you would go online and check what you missed, you could've missed out on what happened in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, or missed out on the wars to the @LOCATION1, or even tragedies that happened right near you.

I think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them. Computers gives information about the latest and most recient things that happen in other towns contries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn'@CAPS1 see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn'@CAPS1 find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldnt want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you correct with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That @MONTH1 not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friend close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people @MONTH1 dislike them but they have good reasons why.

It helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on. For example if you wanted to no about it's sports, you can just type in name. Also a computer can help you with your education. If you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. It is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. It is also a good way to communicate with you friends. For example, facebook, @CAPS3, twitter, and email one all good sources of communication. Also it is good for if you have a xbox or a @NUM1 you need a computer you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. It's good to have computors in school. Is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. It is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it. I hope these one all good reason to have computer in our society, and it will benifit us in a number a differnt ways"

People spend most of their time talking to people on any websites/playing online games. I think that it's a bad habit, people of all ages spend their time doing that when they can do something fun, but chose not to. Parents should be responsible for their children staying on the computer all day and watch out what they are doing because it is dangerous. There has been many people who have been hired. Raped in websites such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many other dangerous websites. In be more I would say that children and adults talk to strangers and think they know that personso well, meet them some place and get killed or anything because many people lie they age. And who know that person can be a fiftey year old woman or man. Say their a teen and end up finding you That is why parents should not be let their children be on period of time and should be on.

I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but thats not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there, but then what would be the fun of that. For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, dont you feel great when your going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful I am thankful to god of giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, georgus. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3.

They benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. Computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with."

For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it."

The students at @ORGANIZATION2, especially @NUM1 graded, are able to type up easys because it's faster and alot easier. If we are at home and we forgot our homework we could look it up online. This can be really helpful and convient to students and teachers. Sometimes it's not @ORGANIZATION1 but its finding things. Technology and computers have came a long way. Now we can look up directions to places we dont or cant find. People can also finding names, numbers, or address useing websites like yellow pages can be a relieable resource for that. Say your going for vaction and your try to find somewhere to stay it could be tough but there are websites you can go on were if you want something fast or mabye a nice hotel for a low price you can find it. The computer can be very fan and intersting when you go places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and you want to show picture of the great time you had so you can post them online. Say you havent talked to and old friend in a while, you can look for them on @CAPS3 or another website and start talking agian you can also play games and connect with friends or play games with friends while online. Weather its @ORGANIZATION1, finding things, or connecting with frends the computer has what ever you need. Maybe it will at one point get damged but they have people who can fix it.

America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time.

They provide a wide arrow of games, educational can just plain fun. You can play role playing games (which and fun because I play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on islands, or other downlodabal education games that are, @CAPS1 not fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child. They also can help kids learn how to and other things at a very early age. Some very adults have and various other things that I cannot the life of me think of @CAPS2 thing computer get them together and they are happy. They do this hundreds of a day. Take away computers and people will die alone and sad. so in conclusion my ideas where! fun help kids and help older people get together. Read this and @CAPS3 sure you'll see it my way."

One of them is we need computers for so that we can get around, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers.

Advances in technology helps us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends and family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is because computers/phones can help us get information on things we need to get information on. We need to know what is going on around us, all the time. We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives. We need to know the weather/traffic conditions if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co-worker sent you anything important that you need to know about. The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online. We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer. Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy, even though we can't see them in person. I, for one, knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online. Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong. The last reason why I support advances in technology is because computers can help us with our reading and hand-eye coordination skills. Computers can help our reading skills because if we don't have time to go to the bookstore to get a book, we can read the book online for free. It can help our hand-eye coordination because it can help our fingers move faster and help us do things faster. I stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need to get information on, we can chat with friends / family online and it can help our reading and hand-eye coordination skills."

In my opinion I think computers do. They provide entertainment, acess to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society here in why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite @CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like @CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the @CAPS1 were @CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather. Instead or local news imidiatly acess it on you @CAPS4 you can acess encyclopedia and distionarys like at the websites @CAPS5 provide an easy imidiats fools for daily uses. One least example towards the of computers Their are many websites that you can. One of @CAPS5 websites is called , @CAPS6 lets you upload picture of pople or family events for people in you @MONTH1 video chat with people over a and see the other persons face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone.

In conclution, @CAPS5 reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society, They provide entertainment, easy acess to and have many websites for social interactions, @CAPS7 society would be alot harder and this is why I think computers benifit society.

Ever since computers were invented people haven't been exercising. Also less kids are reading. Lastly computers are taking away family time. When was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport? If you haven't it's probably because they are inside with their eyes glued to a computer screen. Exercise is a big part in staying healthy and fit. More kids are becoming over weight everyday. Computer are just another reason why. I had a friend who used to spend all her time on the computer. She became very lazy. She never wanted to exercise or doing anything active. Little by little she started gaining weight. This is happening all around the world and it need to @CAPS4! What's your reading level? @CAPS3 are students in @NUM1 grade with a @NUM2 grade reading level. Part of the reason is because they rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book. Schools now do program called @CAPS5 @NUM3. This program is designed to help students improve their reading levels. I believe that if students would turn off the computers long enough and @CAPS5 we wouldn't need this program. My mom makes sure I @CAPS5 for at least @NUM4 mins everyday. Every student do the same. I remember a saying ""family time is golden time"" @CAPS6, now a days no one spends time with their family. Once again computers have played a part in this too. It's not just kids who have droped family time for computer time. It's adults too. I think the last time I spent some time with my family was about @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit. After that everyone went right back to staring at computer screens. In conclusion, the computers"

Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' schoolworks. Finally, you are able to talk with other people on-line. These are just a few points why computers are very importent, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind becasue you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convinient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in-laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, now-a-days they even have on-line tutors and on-line colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With videochat, chatrooms, facebook and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even on-line dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after mu uncle divoriced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those on-line dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way. In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic inevntion because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home. recieve help with your schoolwork, and talk with other people on-line. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time."

I think the advances in technology is a good thing. Way? I'll give you @NUM1 reasons. My first reason is they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Next reason is makes life better. And my last reson is it give you hand-eye coordination @CAPS3't you sick of haveng to go to the book stor and find a book to do a project? well now with the computers you don't have to. You just go online and look up the info that you need to learn about almost anything form the use to @LOCATION1. Next reason is computers make life better."

I do not belive computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future. My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fine, and thosands of creatures. With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities. Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead you can just @CAPS2 or email them and @CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person! In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers! Thank you for your time and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter. "

First I would like to start off by saying its good that people are into computers and working with them because that books their learning activities and they learn new thinngs and it will help them be sucessfull in life, people play games, cross word puzzles, riddles, and many more.

In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society."

I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS2, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" @CAPS2, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS2, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS2, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot!"

Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to."

This number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer. It help us communicate better get imformation quicker and entertain us. Computer have a very positive effect on us. With the invention of the computer, more and more people can communicate quicker and eaisier. For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, @CAPS1 you have relatives who live across the country, you could use webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world. You can learn alot more about other countries culture and other cities way of life. Finally, @CAPS1 a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, the relationship just gets better. The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet you can findout how tall a maple tree is or , how to lose weight. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities nature walks and new and exciting excersises. When students need information on a school project, they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it. When the computer came, people could plaly games, watch @CAPS2.V. and movies, and do business. @CAPS1 you missed you favorite @CAPS2.V. Show you can go online and watch them. @CAPS1 you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, e-mail comes into place, and you mail will never be slow. And finally, you can play many, many games on the internet to keep up that eye hand coordination. With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. Theres information quicker, communication better, and entertainment better. All of the search were in a very good world."

The question then is, @CAPS1 computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is bad effect. People constantly use the computers teach them bad habbits and can search inappropriate things. IF people are always playing games the computers then when @CAPS1 they go out for a jag. The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in @LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""@CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, you know it you've wasted the wrote day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really and you don't to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get air. As you can computer can mesmorised a lot so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on bad habbits. For example, kids are always. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people dont use the. Too much and get too used writing like that. Then, kids @MONTH1 start doing that on writing in school and most even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to. learn your. Lastly is very easy for people, even to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words ad pictures and no one would ever know. people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to no easy to inappiopriate things. So go and limit the time you on computer."

First of all, computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have. Computers have helped todays life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didnt know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likley you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where its located or anything else abot it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say your going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the adress and the internet will give you directions. Even if you dont know when your favorite to show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefits society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well, because one of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about christmas i found her on facebook and now we talk and catch up because we havent seen each other in years, @CAPS2 alone tak to her. Another reason why is that if someones mon or dad is away at war or oversea's then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, skype, yahoo instant messenger, with the webcam or the telephone just @CAPS2 alone just typing back and fourth. You could also just use it for a job buisness to talk to your co-worker or one of your workers on webcam to see things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technollogy has come a long way. For example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use. Today you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font and much more. Another reason why is with iphones or i touches now you dont have to be at home you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to. To find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza but technollogy has come a long way. So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didnt knew before and finally computers have changed a lot and they are apart of our technology.

I sure do. I find my computer benefits the society because you can interact with others online. Its easy to find entertainment and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now you @MONTH1 not beleive computers are "" Society friendly"" but I am here to argue that statement. Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system. So once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is exactly why I beleive the computer benefits the society. The computer lets you interact with other, keeps you entertained and is very helpful and profitable. So quite frankly, you should beleive that the computer is society benefitcial. Thank you for your time."

Computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer are; teach hand-eye coordination. give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last hit not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explaine more about what a positve effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just ga off and playing video games on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. when you use the computer there os so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a in your socical or history about the country or and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand-eye coordination. First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skills, you should try to look at the computer screan. and not be working down at you finger keys. Not only is that not helping you hand-eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truely is unbelievable. Are you one of those people who's parents don't you get a phone because use of how much it costs without even the cost of texting? Well if you are, the computer help you out with that problem aswell!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use @CAPS1 to instant your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The comp. is so hanndy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w/ hand-eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the comp is a in every household."

I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And insted of having to hand write that book we can typr it up. I find these are resons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net. The next day she is on happy you are connected. Thats she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect, this not only happens on facebook, not all over the internet! Reconecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on next door you can even send a picture of your new born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconect to these we have lost. Other are very inportant. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write our everthing word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So dont worry that @NUM1 page paper, you can just type it and with some softwear, you can even your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adult to. That dissnes proposle can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology site gets easier, and the gives more time other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effects is just helpful ness."

They teach hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive effect on people. Spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so important that have throuhout school teaching us how to type. we also use hand-eye coordination is loaded and. You have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the. Computers are helpful in many ways. Have you ever about what looks like or what would be found on it? With a computer you can. Comuputers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get pictures some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who lies there. Yes, you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life easier. Computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. They give you the oppurtunity to talk with people online whether the world the street. In order to do this you need a web. They are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. Its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country. Its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spanding to much time an computer and not on exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. All of these things should be. All you have to do is manage your time. Or not all day on the computer. If you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created. I would like to thanks all f the reader for there time and hope hat you all support me and my ideas."

Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION3. Who knows, it will definetly be an experience, for sure."

The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to eachother. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along. His buisiness transfered @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh-air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vaction. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vaction because they don't know about the country or place."

Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living."

It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world."

Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you."

I know a computer has helped me far years so why would I teminate it or want it gone. Heres the controversy, many experts believe computers don't benefit society but people, such as myself, believe the exact oppositte. Their are many benefits to oconing a computer such as they're always a source of information, allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, have their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamon. He never found the diamond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. due to a computer he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of. also, computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones, with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication. for example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss, you can even choose what type of handwriting it types. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. Althourgh, some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addition. Still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work."

It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the "" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book.

Three reasons why I think so are comunication, @CAPS2, entertainment and, @CAPS3. One of my favorite things to do is talk and when on of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number I thought we had no way of doing it. One day he requested me on facebook and from there on we have been comunicating on web sites like facebook, myspace and, skype. My second reason why computer's benifit our society is @CAPS2. At my dad's house I do not have a television so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world. A website called @CAPS4.com was the frist to anounce @PERSON1's death befor anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break rest on the internet. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, comunicate with friends. The last reason why computers benefit our society is @CAPS3. Many @CAPS3 in our comunity require computer skills such as a acountant, a manager, software designner, and a computer programer. The computer make @CAPS3 and more eficient by correcting mistakes, providing a visual and typeing. These are the reasons why computers affect our community in a positive way."

I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising, enjoying, and being with family and friends. Exercising is a major part of every persons life and if you don't get enough of it you could become obeise. Obeisity @MONTH1 cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don't care what others think, but in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way. exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny joy, go for a walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant 'in person? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn't you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would and I think most other people would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, nature, and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life."

Because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side. The second reason is the computer help you in your house for example: You have the big problem with your car or something like that.

This is fabolous but don't used the webcam for something bad you can learn thing that you don't know. I think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing. Appraise the computer.

Computers can also, @CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people.

Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you @MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you @MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way. "

Back then I had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio. Now computers are very popular. I believe that computers have positive effect on people @DATE1 because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to acess them. You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. Which is good because its much easier. For example im a student that can't draw so printed some pictures of the computer so I can paste them on my post board. So in the other words the computer is useful for students. I know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or its a zero. In this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of intersting because you can up with friend that you haven't seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantaes because you would have nvever thought you will see your friend doing. Another thing about computers that you can fint stuff cheaper than everyday lif say if you want to a trip and you call @ORGANIZATION1 for your ticket. The ticket came up to . But you go on the computer and you on @ORGANIZATION1 website and find your ticket to florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a restion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convince. At home if my labtop is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what to do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to acess one! In this generation everybody is rushing and computers."

I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh tha's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it's your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise. "

Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication."

But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!"

I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job."

Well I would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way. The computer is like a addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. I dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Every were you look theres a computer. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? "

You don't see kids outside as often. On the news, you hear about obesity. And you hear the crime rates go up. This does not benefit the socierty. Computers has a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be locking children? It's not because their dead! They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don't know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don't exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he's in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's, mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone's name and be underover. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick-minded people get to you or your kids. Take action now!"

If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she sould go out side and get some fresh air and get some exrcise. Some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurder/kill you.

I would, we need computer for many things, for example we need computer for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. Next this is good for buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @MONTH1 have missed as if you was absent. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @MONTH1 be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Now a days many college students with work going on @MONTH1 not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. With computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @CAPS1 from the I have told you like communications, education, and buying and selling products I hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society"

You can do alot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convinient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see @LOCATION1, you can go online to learn @CAPS1 language. You can also study food s that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can daunloads and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure that let you explore new lands. And in alot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are otherways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, facebook, twitter, and video chat.

It think computers have posotive effects on people. But some experts believe they don’t which is why I'm writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. Computers believe it they help us in life wether @CAPS1 to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @DATE1, @CAPS1 one of the most important devices. Let me share my expierence okay. I had a job interview right well I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview. Thats why I think computers have posotive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. Well I have some people spend to much time on their computer @CAPS1 completely choice. And those are people who usually don't have alot of self control. And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. So in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important."

The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. But why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer. I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. Sure enough he was! I got the home work and got an A all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others."

Well, if you are, I believe that should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom says only an hour aa day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and (or) play over a friends house. Yes, playing on computer is fun, but you have to execise to. (you know) @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors. Like that's how I met trees, animals, beautiful senery. You could feel like you were having the time or your. The last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use. you could make snowmen in the winter or if it's raining you could watch a movie. you could build a lot. In conclusion building, playing and jumping (the list could go on) You can enjoy the outdoors. Just rember the three good reason why are you could use the wonderful and lovly outdoors. Go walk you dog, have friends ober or even just having out with your family and friends."

Long time ago we don't even have computers, but now we do. Now we have computers we should use it. If we don’t use computers why we even have computers? Computers can help you to learn faraway places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and other faraway places. If we don't know what is going on faraway places then we don't know what kind flag they have and what do they eat, what do they have, are what they do, and what do they speak. You can even talking online with your friends on computer! You dont have to call you friend, you can just talk to you frien on online, if you need help with your homework are you left your math text book at school you frient can tell you the questions by talking online. If your friend is in @LOCATION2 are other faraway places your friend can bring there computer with him or her so your friend can just talking to you by talking online, you dont have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other places. You can also learn how to type, when you know how to type you can type faster and faster. You can type storys, poem, and notes are something you have to do at school, so you don't have to write on a pace of peaper you can just type on computer. That is why we should have computers and use more. I hope you agree with me."

The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people."

And @CAPS1 you want familys to be distant because they are to pre @CAPS2? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of familys dont talk because they are to preocupied with computar games. The issue to grapple with is @CAPS1 computars have an affect on people. Yes, I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enought exersize, they dont enjoy the nature that we have, and they dont inter act with there family and friends. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enough exersize. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight spend more time on the computar than on the track. I remember a time when I was over weight be cause I spent to much time on the computar. One day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and I had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize. @CAPS1 you want kids to be over weight like I was? Many people dont get to enjoy the great out doors because they are to preocupied with the computar.

Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house insted of in a big library with all the information you need. I think that computars have a negitive impact on people."

To start with, computers have a possitive affect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Also it allows people to talk online from far away places. So, yes, computers are good for people. First of all, computers do have a possitive affect. The computer @MONTH1 give some one motivation. Or it will help someone find their lost pet. Also it could help you get a job. Plus you can find a safe home with it. So, ya computers do have a possitive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. Also you can get information on places you will visit. This will help learn about diffrent contrays. Most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. This concluds that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for familys. Also people who have hospitilized family. Plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a possitive affect on people. They given us ability to learn! Lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away. So, in conclution, it is a benifit for people to use the computers!"

The only diffrence now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder. I deffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone elses lifes easier. With the computer it teaches hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I belive the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from “@CAPS2 drivers.com” the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decraced over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like “@CAPS3” a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pa. the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in “@CAPS4-tech” magazine. I should also add in it has reconected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online. So do me a favor state legislator relize and come to terms how much society needs the computer."

All the facts of life and the world are put into it. Think of all the knowledge you would have from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to birds eye view. There's your map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework.

There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. Your late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on.

Something I havent mentioned is, I use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didnt go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I relized after I got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. My dad then disconected my @CAPS4, and I beleive my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconecting the @CAPS4, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @CAPS3 home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, ""blogtv.com."" were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing!

Take away your computer and all youre doing is sitting thhere, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, [expect your fingers of ] @CAPS2't you think you should be doing something more usefull in your life?

Computers occupy a lot of people's time which could be used for other matters. The internet also contains alot of unappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many petafiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in america is climbing. There is no doubt that electronics, play a huge role in this event. For example my brother plays on the computer everyday, so barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also there is alot of content. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornagraphy. most sites don't even alert you that by how you need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very little acctually ask for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children as a young teens. Its truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and. Petafiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive, to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location, and to commit rape. Some victims are enough speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet.

They could have moved to a different city, State or even cuntry and the only @MONTH1 to connect with them is by They can't call each other @CAPS2 they really far away that would be a pretty phone bill. Seventy five percent of people talk to thier friends through computer. About half of the people are talking to friends who live in another state. or country. Do you really want people to lose their friends? Next, people can actually make new friends in the computer, like pen pals. Pen pals are people you write to but they don't live in the state as you or sometimes not even the same country. assignment at school but you can do it on your @CAPS2 your pen pal doesn't live in the same country as you and doesn't speak fluend @CAPS3 you can teach them @CAPS3 and they can teach you these language.

They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren't even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, ""where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment."

Sure they arnt very good for you dosn't mean if you use it correctly then it can be a souce of life. Computers are helpful in many ways, they can be an information post. The social networks can help your kids get more interactive with the world. During school kids have projects and without computers. Read on as I will explain in details. Computers, as you know, are one of the worlds greatest information posts. @NUM1 out of ten people survayed said that the computers are a value of everyday life, The earthquake in haiti is recovalng now, but half the world wouldnt know that with out computers so have a heart, and dont take away the most valued info in the world. Secondly, what would you say if I told, you that kids are more socialy retarded than ever! Well its true. Over @NUM2 of the worlds people rely on intractive websites to comunicate with each other. Fact, children have more friends over the internet then ever. You dont want to be the @LOCATION1 in all this do yours ar know as the person who kept kids from living? I dont think so. Lastly, all people in school use computers to do projects, for instance @PERSON2 had horrible hand writing and this was the bigest project of the year. So he turned his computer to type it, he gets on at. But what if there was (@CAPS1) computer! @PERSON2 would have gotten a @CAPS2 - for the project. In fact teachers @CAPS3 wear tell kids to type hw/projects. @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 year kids pass my class by typing and if they then they would all flunk!"" @CAPS4 got the point but more importantly do you?! To sumit all up for those of you lazy enough to not read there story essay. Computers are used for everyday needs such as finding out information. Makeing friends, or doing projects. So are you gonna be the person who sits back and lets that happen or are you going to get up and stop the maddness once and for all. Its you choice but think of the socity retarded, dumb kids that fail the grade @CAPS3 year."

They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. "

This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are making a great impact! Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. This is useful in daly life all the time! Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented at things requiring their hands (like baseball or basket ball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too. Something as simple as driving a car doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in hand-eye coordination computers bring. This is a fantastic effect that computers have on people. In addition to the hand-eye coordination computers teach, they also help you learn about faraway places and people. This splendid information is easier to aquire thanks to the technowlogy of computers. ""@CAPS2 I didn't use my laptop for my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report,"" says @PERSON1, and @NUM1 grade student, "" I would never finish. Books take so long and I learned so much about my topic from my computer!"" @CAPS2 you are going on vacation, You can easily research your destination's location and culture with this advanced search engine. Why wouldn't you use a computer when you learn so much from them? Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other. They have lots of ways to video chat, @CAPS6 message, and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with. ""I had to move away from my best friend last @DATE1,"" says @PERSON3, resident of @LOCATION1, ""With my computer we can still talk to each other and stay friends."" computers are definatly a great way to communicate with friends and family. Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people; and even allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing! Ask yourself this, how would computers have a positive effect in your life?"
