What if I would sacrifice my life for you   What if I would say I'd give up my dreams too   What if you were meant to be my destiny   But what if love, was never meant for you and me      I'm trying real hard   Cause I know that a friend is something you can't be   Our love is too deep   Or is this our fate   Just a never ending battle no one else can see   I refuse to give in   But I'm afraid to start something we can't win      What if I would sacrifice my life for you   What if I would say I'd give up my dreams too   What if you were meant to be my destiny   But what if love, was never meant for you and me      Love is magic   Love is irresistible   But love is fearless and not able to see   Love is gorgeous   Love is unpredictable   But love is brainless and sometimes so are we...      What if I would sacrifice my life for you   What if I would I'd give up my dreams too   What if you were meant to be my destiny   But what if love, was never meant for you and me      And our love was never meant for you and me   No our love was never meant for you and me.Where were you last night?.You think it's funny?.I don't know if it's me,   I don't know if it's you,   I don't know if it's both of us   Not knowing what to do   When we're running out of love..You are my sweet, sweet baby..They want your mind and your body   But they don't understand   And don't care much about it   Gotta work for your country   Society's built on concrete and money   If this room was to vanish   And the toys of man turned to civilized dust   There'd still be you and me, honey   With our history gone   But the spirit lives on      Build those highways, build those cars   On a planet full of scrap metal   There'd better be life on mars      [Chorus:]   It's alright, it's alright   If you don't think about it   It's alright   If you don't look at it, it's alright      How time slips away   Live by the good book   That's what the wise men say   But where does it leave us   Were they right or were they wrong   Gotta have hope, gotta carry on      It's alright, it's alright   It's alright, it's alright      They want your soul and your spirit   Make them understand   These things they never can have   Gotta work for your family   A community built on trust, not money   If this town was to vanish   And the office blocks were just turned into ashes   They'd be you and me, honey   With the will to survive   And the spirit lives on      Build those factories   Plants and cars   On a planet so desecrated   There'd better be life on mars      [Chorus]      How time slips away   Live by the good book   That's what the wise men say   But where does it leave us   Were they right or were they wrong   Gotta have hope   Gotta carry on      It's alright, it's alright.He's no more than a boy..Baby I'm lonely, I'm out of control,   I need someone to understand   The badness in my soul..Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids..[Chorus]   And then you smile at me   Is that a wink I see?.Drift away, just drift away..I shake all over and you know why   I am sure its love honey that's no lie   Cause when you call my name   You know I burn like a wooden flame   You leave me ah   Breathless!.And alloy suitors were all inside   An apple or a grape   To put forth a cloud of Mercury   In front of a mighty car   On a freeway in Los Angeles   Once the spraying has been done   'Cause there's more pain from necessity   You're a portrait of your past,   There's a mummy in the cabinet..I'm sweating,   And breathing   And staring and thinking   And sinking   Deeper..Certain materials being removed from libraries such as books, music and magazines, shouldn't be removed from the libraries. It gives people a chance to understand how the real world @CAPS2.     Having certain materials such as books and music definitly should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book @CAPS2 or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song @CAPS2 saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band @PERSON1 A.M. @CAPS2, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really the band @CAPS2 talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost there legs, and telling how beautiful each and everyone of them really are. His book taught me a few things and made me think different about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person @CAPS2 beautiful.     As far as movies and magazines has gone within the last few years, I think that the also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think @CAPS1 for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course we see previews of movies and think that they @MONTH1 not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out. Movies @CAPS2 a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarassed or maybe even get @CAPS4. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possible save your life or perhaps maybe even someone elses life.     I don't understand why some libraries would want to banned certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone elses life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did."

Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not.  Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life.  This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.     Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries.  They find these things to be offensive.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended.  The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive.  The library is a place for study.  It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world.  It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.     I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive.  Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research.  There are certain sections in the library.  If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section.  I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section.  The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not.  If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.     Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need.  One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it.  If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it.  The library can be compared to a big computer.  One can basically find anything there.  Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs.  It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.     Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life.  If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left.  People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone.  There does not need to be any censorship in libraries.  It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find."

Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.      The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.      However, some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.     Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it"

If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.  Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in.     I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school.  The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.  Even teachers were reading it.  The school board did not even care though.  I think that was completely handled the wrong way.  They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it.  If it offended her, then she should not read it.     Music is an outlet for many people.  They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing.  Without music, there would not be any fun in the world.  People are alwasy listening to music.  When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc.  If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.     Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time.  That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian.  We want to good guys to win.  The movie makes fun of the bad guys.  Somebody is always going to get hurt.     When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else.  I think of how the artist feels.  Why they wrote it that certain way.  If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first.  Then if I like it, I start singing it.  If I do not like it, then I just change the song.     I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended.  We need the different opinions in life.  If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway.  I do not want to be the same as everybody else.  I love my personality.  I am different and kind of an outcast.  But I am true to myself.  And I respect other people's opinions.  I wish everyone would do the same.  Or at least try to do the same.  Thank you for listening to what I had to say"

What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same.     Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now.     If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not.     People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truely enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated.  If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?"

In this country, an author can write freely about whatever he desires and he is not subject to penalty for doing so. Sometimes reading these works can be enjoyable, other times it can be rather disturbing. However, just because a work is offensive does not mean that it is not worth reading. Books, manuscripts, and other forms of literature should not be taken off the shelves even if they are disturbing or offensive.      The @CAPS1, a book written by @PERSON2, revealed the horrible practices of the meat packing industry. It was offensive to many, and in addition it caused an uprising among @CAPS2 because of its content. However, there is a reason that book is still talked about today. If there had been laws prohibiting him from writing about the horrific things that were taking place in those factories, it is quite possible and actually very likely that the industry wouldn't have been reformed for a long time. Fortunately, @PERSON2 exposed the horrific processes that took place in the industry and the government stepped in and solved the problem. Someone out there hates this book, and hated it from the day it was published. But that doesn't mean he has the right to remove it from the shelves and prevent all others from reading it.     Too often students are forced to read works of fiction and stories that, although they are beneficial for students, do not inform students about the world in which they find themselves. It is important for a student to read @ORGANIZATION1, and the works @PERSON4 and @LOCATION1. However, students must learn and begin to understand the world in which they currently find themselves, the eras of the past, and the circumstances that they will find themselves in for decades to come. They must learn how to become successful in life. They should read works by @PERSON1, such as @CAPS3, which essentially tells the story of success and what seperates the average from the great. Someone out there hates these works, and he should not have the right to ruin the opportunity that these books and short stories could give someone else.     Reading is the best way to learn. In a world of social networking and 'screens' of all types, the importance of reading has been diminished. Students must develop a love of reading, and if everyone who hates a book takes it off the shelves, then, as Paterson said, 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' No book should ever be taken off the shelves. Never"

People @MONTH1 not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraires keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the self? I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyones going to wnat to read something different.        If libraries are going to take the material off the self that people don't like then the material that others like would be gone. For instance,if i were to take the '@CAPS1' series off the selves then all the '@CAPS1' fans would be ferious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There is alot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries arn't going to take them off the selfs.     Some parents arn't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, rasy book but thats what other adults enjoy reading. Those books arn't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want you're chilren to read them.     From experiance, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an imatture addiunce. But i'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the self. Some books are very vulger and nasty in the ways they discribe fights or wars or abuse but some people like readinf lititure like that so the libraries will keep them. If peoplehave problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them. Its as simple as that.      In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interest and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgur then they shouldn't ready that book, and if they dont want their childrena and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because thats not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them.                              Sincerly, @PERSON1"

 Come on here ... yeah !.Okay..I belive certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information. I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies etc. from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?. Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a @NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom. In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries."

Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and come try understanding? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds, and see these 'offenses' as a normality.     You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?     If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book.     The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed?"

just about everything.  There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information.  There is even some information that some people might take offence to.  On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it.  I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.     The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries.  Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race.  Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about.  Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race.  This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.     Libraries have all kinds of information.  I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain.  Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know"

  Slashing destruction, your right hand sword ringing   To the ends of the earth you will fly   Conquering masses in wanton deception   Blood-red your black flag waves high      Child of fire   The souls that are damned   By the pain that you bring   Send you higher      Look around, is this the end that you have foreseen   The pain, the misery in us all   What was it that you knew?.Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing"

drummer boy!.Yeah, come on      On that sunny day   Didn't know I'd meet   Such a beautiful girl   Walking down the street   Seen those bright brown eyes   With tears coming down   She deserves a crown   But where is it now   Mamma listen      Senorita, I feel for you   You deal with things, that you don't have to   He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm   But you could feel this real love   If you just lay in my      Running fast in my mind   Girl don't you slow it down   If we carry on this way   This thing might leave the ground   How would you like to fly?.I hid it in the seam of your coat   It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat   Do you even know that I can't let go      [Outro]   Hope you know, I won't let go.WAYLON:   It seems like yesterday, but it was a long time ago   She was lovely, she was the queen of my nights   There in the darkness with the radio, playin' low   The secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved   Caught like a wildfire out of control   There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove   JOHNNY:   And I remember what she said to me   How she swore that it would never end   I remember how she held me oh, so tight   Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then   CHORUS (ALL):   Against the wind   We were running against the wind   We were young and strong   But just running against the wind   WILLIE:   And the years rolled slowly past, I found myself alone   Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends   I found myself further and further from my home   I guess I lost my way, there were oh, so many roads   I was livin' to run and runnin' to live   Never worrying about paying or how much I owed   Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time   Breakin' all of the rules I could bend   I began to find myself searchin'   Searchin' for shelter again and again   CHORUS (ALL):   Against the wind   We were running against the wind   I found myself seekin'   Shelter against the wind   WILLIE:   All those drifter's days are passed me now   I've got so much more to think about   JOHNNY:   Deadlines and commitments   What to leave in, what to leave out   CHORUS (ALL):   Against the wind   We were running against the wind   Well I'm older now and still   Running against the wind   Against the wind   Against the wind   Against the wind.The water is wide, I can't cross o'er   Ad neither have I wings to fly   Give me a boat that can carry two   And we shall row, my love and I      II   For love is gentle, and love is kind   The sweetest flower when first it's new   But love grows old and waxes cold   And fades away like morning dew      continued below...         advertisement         III   There is a ship and she sails the sea   She's loaded deep as deep can be   But not as deep as the love I'm in   I know now how I sink or swim.Share my life, Take me for what I am   Cause I'll never change, all my colours for you      I don't really need to look very much further   I don't want to have to go, Where you don't follow   I won't hold it back again, This passion inside   Can't run from myself   There's nowhere to hide      And don't make me close one more door   I don't wanna hurt anymore   Stay in my arms if you dare   Or must I imagine you there   Don't walk away from me... (Don't walk away)   I have nothing, nothing, nothing....You always get to me   Here's to me calling off this war   Here's to me walking out that door   Here's to the only casualty   Here's to the mess that you made of me   You always get to me   Always get to you   Always do your worst to get the best of me   Me always pushing you   Always pushing me   Always manage to being the worst in you!.(2x)   When the sun don't shine it don't shine at all...   Don't it make you smile?.Though I'm on my own I can't be free,   Baby, I just live for you..The door it opened slowly,   My father he came in,   I was nine years old..For you   It's all in a day   One day in a life   It's all in the one word   The one word is goodbye      For me   It's all in what you say   Though you've tried to be kind   It's all in the words   From the lips that once touched mine with a sigh   Goodbye      For you   It's all in your face   The laugh and worry lines   It's all in the one word   You hope will make you young again   Goodbye      It's all in the play   Someone speaks the line   It's all in the one word   That stops and steals the time   Goodbye   Goodbye   Goodbye      For me   It's all in a day   It's the part in life   When it's all in the words   To fate and circumstance resigned   Goodbye...Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember. Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve?     What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it? Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published? Publishers do read the books they publish them, they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magizine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway.                                         In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing. It is never the parents fault.                                             If people pull unsensored things out of the library it will serve no purpose and thats just my opinion. I know that i have no say in it and thats ok i can still believe that i am right.

"Black days of winter all were through   The blossoms came and they brought you   Clouds left the sky, I knew the reason why   They made way for you   And the blossom and the blossom      The seasons cycle turned again   An April shower now and then   Trees came alive, bees left their hive   They came out to see you   And the blossom and the blossom      People were laughing, smiling with the sun   They knew that summer had begun      The days grew warm, the nights grew long   Spring turned to summer and was gone   It seemed so fine, the cider and the wine   But I knew you'd go   With the blossom, with the blossom      When spring returns, I'll look again   To find another blossom friend   Until I do, find something new   I'll just think of you   And the blossom and the blossom   I'll

is hot and that old clock is movin' slow and so am I   Work day passes like molasses in winter time, but it's July..Forgot about the others,   We moved out t'ward the light showin' empty hands..Are there any more   Country families   Still working hand in hand   Trying hard to stay together   And make a stand?.This is what's wrong with today's society. We are too soft.We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples feelings. And I say that to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different. I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are. Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race.      Anybody ever think of that? If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from lifes normalcies. They've gotta learn sometime. Life isn't lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Everytime I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own"

holding on   This is where you need to be      All the days that you've been spending   Spinning while your heart's descending   Like a stone in the ocean   Sometimes when you think the world is ending   It's really just a new beginning   The other side of emotion      But I've seen your eyes   No compromise   When you set your mind on the matter   Be strong through the tears   And your sight will clear   You're gonna get what you're after      [Chorus]      Don't be surprised when the road divides   Just take the one less traveled by      [Chorus].Oh, very nice   Very nice   Very nice   Very nice   ...But maybe in the next world      Love, peace and harmony?.I tried to run from winter   Like this spring and summer run to fall   But when the weather's in you   There's no hiding place at all, that's why      Winter has me in it's grip   Think I'll take a summer trip   On a sunny sailing ship   Where the shells lie in the sand..If music be the food of love then play on   Lend me your ears as I lay down this song   You're touched by the feeling-it's hard to control   Let me tell you people   I was born to rock'n'roll      Some people want to fight- some people want to fly

the word   Got the music in my soul   I was born to rock'n'roll      Some people are born to money   Privileged all their days   Never had a problem-never had to pay   But I don't have a doubt about the feeling in my soul   Let me tell you people   I was born to rock'n'roll      It may sound a little absurd   But I was born to spread the word   Got the music in my soul   I was born to rock'n'roll

A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how @CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.       If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech.  Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it.  It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by.  If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone.  In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.     Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.  It will still be around.  It is just something in our world that we have to live with"
"""If only I could see you,"" says the voice within your brain   and quietly, insistently it says it once again..I was closer to you back then..The judge said, ""Understand, this is not a court""..We'd like to point him out to you people,   But don't look now..Home is where they want you now,   You can more or less assume that you'll be welcome in the end..I never claimed to be different, I only said I was bored and she's   tired of your uniqueness, it sends her over head first then the rest   of her follows, the breath of life, it never left her hollow....Do you wanna meet   Samantha: ""Umm, well my brother gets the car on Friday nights."".We've been fine for so long now,   How can something go wrong   That I can't see?.I said ""I'd rather get off here."".Just another lazy man who couldn't take what was his..Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone   But watch it break when I get you alone   Take a chance, come lay down with me   Oh, I wanna make it      Slow and steady never lost the race   Don't stop runnin', I'm a fool for the chase   Play the game, surrender to me   Baby, I don't wanna fake it      Is it any wonder, you got me comin' under fire?.When we, when we go,   Do we die?.It's a fine, fine line   Betwixt love and hate..Let the sun stop burning..Never dreamed   That a home could be   Dark and cold,   I was told,   Every day in my childhood   Even when we grow old   Home should be where the heart is   Never were words so true   My heart's far far, away   Home is too..You and I were like a light from a fallen star   You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart      [Chorus]   Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I fall all over again   And I just can't hold on to your love anymore   Don't you look at me like that, 'cause I start all over again   And it just can't be, like it was once before      Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel   You and I were like a light from a fallen star   You can't go back, you can't run away from your heart      Don't stand there in the rain, lookin' like some long lost angel   (No, I never could turn away from you)      [Chorus].Nobody else in the world but you   Nobody else in the world   Nobody else in the world but you   In case you haven't noticed   there's lots of other people here, too      And now it?s time you did a little giving, baby   The world is not your plaything, no, no, no      (Solo)   Nobody else in the world but you   Nobody else in the world   Nobody else in the world but you   In case you haven't noticed   there's lots of other people here      Nobody else in the world but you   Nobody else in the world   It?s like there's?nobody else in the world but you   In case you haven't noticed there are lots of other people here, too.Gump was a big celebrity   He told JFK that he really had to pee   He never feels too dumb because   His mom always told him stupid is as stupid does   He's Gump, he's Gump   He's kinda square   He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump   What's with that hair?.Bedsitter people look back and lament,   Another day's useless energy spent..Everybody, we ought to change sometime,   Because sooner or later we're going down in that lonesome ground..Black hope shot down   There's a gun in his hand   That souls divine   There's a hole in his head..At last!.All throughout the world there are libraries.  Librairies have all different kinds of materiel stacked upon shelves.  Most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not.  I think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves.  Yes, i understand some of this material @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this.     If libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, ect.  I think they should be able to keep them.  Just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone won't like it.  Everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions.  Isn't that what makes the world go around?       Adults @MONTH1 have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library.  I understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material.  If libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries i think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go.  That way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not.       We go to school for a vast amount of reasons.  Some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent.  While we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us.  If you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies.  We, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday.  Since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it?     There is alot of different kinds of material in libraries.  Some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate.  I understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it.  I think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm"

The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.     The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition.     The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it. Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter.     The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves. The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.     In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is."

only did she do them wrong,   She did ev'ryone of them in, them in,   She did ev'ryone of them in..On Fourth Street in Louisville in 1978   Stranded in a honky-tonk, somewhere 'tween dates   There was a little band playin' as I sipped my beer   But I never thought that I'd hear what I'd hear      There was a young man a pickin' 'lectric guitar   Smokin' and a snippin', a learnin' how to be a star   He had a big blue bandanna tied around his head   A laid-back bass and a drummer named Red      Well, his hair was cut long in the fashion of the time   Sandpaper vocal but he milked every line   His fingers like lightnin' on the guitar that he played   He did ""Lay Down Sally"" and""Hank Didn't Do It This Way""      Well, I sat there and listened for over an hour   And the closest thing to country was a rockin' ""Wildwood Flower""   And I got that feelin' that I had been there before   But I knew I had never been through that door      Well, the jukebox was turned on and the band took a break   I made my way up front to howdy and shake   I said, ""Son, I like your music and I kinda like your style."".""Man, Mr. Johnson already taught us this..If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look.     When I was in the eighth grade I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There was alot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that.     If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops.      So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesnt. If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you.     These are some of my opinions about this catagory. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said"

First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area.     A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.     Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library. If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it.     Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed.     So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay. Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area"

We have to ask our selves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just down right boring?     Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We @MONTH1 have the right to take down the books but why should we. It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of stuff the our children should know about, such as the slavery, and famous people.     What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other then the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropraite off the shelves of the library there wouldn't be anymore books. Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books.      Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell u who wants to do that. Nobody,'' it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you @MONTH1 like to, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books they can't.      We don't need to take any books out of the libraries? There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, cause there isn't any good ones. We are just taking away something that is really big to us @CAPS1, and without those books there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do so why take them"

Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen.          Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book @MONTH1 talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer.     Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief.     All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose."

The reason i think that  they should stay on the shelf is because it might interest some of the people that read them. If people don't like them, or they think that it is offensive, they shouldn't go to that library.     I don't get offended by anything. When I am going through the library I have seen people get offended by some of the  things that they have on the shelfs. Reading things and them getting offensive is a totally different thing. People that read things and get offended by it, should have a say in whether it is on the shelf or not.     The reason I think that some of the things shouldn't be on the shelf is because it might be inappropriete. It might not be good for the eyes of people.     I think that all libraries should carry the same content in them. So that way noone is making a big deal about what is on the shelves."

beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen  @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way.  Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics.  Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway.      If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it?  Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited.  They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words.  This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean.      However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music?  Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand.  Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things.      In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored.  Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines.  Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians.  There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out"

Never would have known   You'd come into my life   Now you're the love of my life      [Chorus]   Once in a lifetime   Maybe the last time   Just the right time to fall in love   Once in a lifetime   For such a long time   I've been waiting for you      You were there for me   It was there for you   We were meant to be   Now we're fallin' in love   Finally fallin' in love      [Chorus].If I owned or worked at a librarie, I would have books, music, movies and magazines that to many people are offensive. But I would not have the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in the childrens area of the librarie.But I would have them in the adult area.         @CAPS5 I would keep that type of books, music or movies might you ask? Well because the adult and older tenageers should be able to handle and act like adult when reading the book, watching the movie, listening to music. If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town then i will completly remove the item from the shelf. Its that simple.           If parents get mad and angree because of these books, movie, and music don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them. Pick out a childs book like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, don't pick out a book from @PERSON1. Let your children read a book with lots of pictures and color. Watch @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 not @CAPS3 on a @CAPS4.         My questions is, '@CAPS5 not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive?' @CAPS6 people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music. People live in defferent worlds even though we all live in one.      In my oppenion offensive books, music and movies should stay in libraries. Just little and younger kids shouls not read, watch or listen to them"
"Okay, okay, okay, okay.Ah honey won't you hold on to what's gonna move..You wanted to leave me there, afraid of a love affair,   But I think you know, that I can't let go..O sisters too, how may we do,   For to preserve this day..I guess is better to be in love and not....And ya know I need ya back in my life   Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like   Girl you got that thing for real   When I was on a mission to make it   Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?.Feel good!.I never, never, never, never want to leave   Never, never      I see you in a   Thousand costumes   Strike many a silent pose   I heard you tell a thousand stories   Everyone in a different voice      Still I try, to make you happy   Still I try, to make you sing   Now if you're wonderin', what I think of it all   Just read the back of this postcard      The air here, breathing's great   Lord, we've cooked ourselves   Now were cookin' up an ass kickin' time (didn't we?).Once again now!.Away again   Dreamin........Do not mock me when I say   This is not a lie..[Feat Dee Money]   [Young Jeezy Chorus]   Street niggaz...   Real niggaz..   Street niggaz...   Gangsta niggaz...   Real niggaz...   Street niggaz...   [Dee Money Verse 1]   I relate to niggaz and they relate to me   Real niggas do real things that's how it supposed to be   Cut from the same clothes make the same shirt   Probably had the same glock and got the same worth   I'll whack ya ass and skip to da N.O   And lay low in the projects with my kin-folk   AK-47 with the shoulder strap Set it off had it sounded   Like the Nolia clap Got 2 strikes nigga dodgin the   P.O,P.O's This real life leave ya brains in da thresh hole   I a street nigga mayne pimpin ain't easy leave da block   Silent holla at em Jeezy..!.Rose   But we have a great finish..And we turn corrupt!.So Mary marry me, let's not wait   For those distant drums, might change our wedding day   And love me now, for now is all the time there may be   And if you love me Mary, Mary marry me   Yes, if you love me Mary, Mary marry me.Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked   Long ago in the sweet used to be   And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet   As they did when you picked them for me      And when I think of you and the love we once knew   How I wish we could go back in time   Do you ever think back on old memories like that   Or do I ever cross your mind      Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss   Your sweet lips like I did long ago   And how often I long for those two loving arms   That once held me so gentle and close      And when I think of you and the love we once knew   How I wish we could go back in time   Do you ever recall these old memories at all   Or do I ever cross your mind      When old memories appear my eyes wont stay clear   When I think of those happier times   Do you ever recall these old memories at all   Or do I ever cross your mind      Do you ever think back on old memories like that   Or do I ever cross your mind.You think I like it here, you fucker?.What a long, long time,   Long time...yeah..I need you, it's true little girl,   That you can lift the tears from my eyes..Well, she's gone I know not where,   But now I just don't care..But she gotta hold on (hold on)   Wanna leave the club alone (you dead wrong)   She gotta pay the bills but in the meantime   She like ""fuck how she feel"" living is real   So she back in the club again   Taking off her clothes again   Going to school, going to work, getting tiring   Lack of sleep but baby gotta eat   and these shoes on her feet   She got a test next week so she stressed   Ask god to give her a blessing, send her in the right direction   Her parents died when she was eight years old   And after that, she felt like she was all alone   But she got her grandparents and they raised her well   Keep going to school, take care of yourself   Getting hard, going to school and work in the club   And at the same time looking for love   She can't keep skipping for an occupation   In a minute, she'll be graduating   Make her wanna throw up her hands   Now she only wanna live again      [Chorus]      [Hook]      [Chorus].I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. @CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules. Like buying a rated '@CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is @NUM1, and not @NUM2 years old, but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law. I say shrew the law, because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4, its the parents right to tell/show there kid about things, not the goverment.      I Think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly, and I think we should. @CAPS5 have to follow what ever rules untill there @NUM2 years of age: @CAPS3? I wish I knew @CAPS3, but I dont. Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them.           For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen.     Video games, They are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like '@CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murders.' @CAPS4 makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that.      I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about @CAPS4 all they cant even handle @CAPS4. Its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world. Just because they have been kept away from all that all there life.     I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them @CAPS4 was bad, and never watch/read @CAPS4? Where did they hear @CAPS4 from? I beleive @CAPS4 came from the media @CAPS4 self. I can see the headlines now, '@CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murders.' Then they would have some made up percentage on how manny @CAPS5 turn in to a murder that watch @CAPS6 movie compare to @CAPS5 that don't.     What I am really saying is that I try not to let other peoples beleifs get in my head and change my own beleifs. Even by me writing this @MONTH1 have cause someone to change there beleifs, and I really @CAPS1 hope I haven't."

NO, I belive that every should have the chance to see it to other then the just the people how did and thought it was offensive. Someone could really like it or a group of people could.Even if some people find an object offensive someone else might need that object for something like school work.     Lets say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries becuase people find it offensive. Then a local school has a praject on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now do to somebody elses dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do thier reshearch.     It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive. The libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from. So no i don't belive that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or ext., do to the fact that some other people @MONTH1 find them offensive."

green   And there was no high walls and the sea was clean   Don't stop that sun to shine, it's not yours or mine, no..The media is destroying our youth! this is something we hear everyday. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning.     If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.     Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more.      Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see.  If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see.     Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives. If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop. They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship"

My view on the subject is that, if this begins there will only empty shelfs in librarys across the country. Once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left.     We use books everyday, for students we use them to learn and for a entertainment during someclasses. Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about. Even as adults some of them like to read in there free time.     I think its wrong to remove a book off of the shelf, just because a few or a bunch of people think its inaproprate. If it is the librarys should have section for those books that dont let the little kids go in that section. their is a problem for this idea, what books should go into this section of the library? A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to to remove or put into a speacial section in the librarys across the nation. This idea goes the same for everything found at a library.     Another soulution to this matter is that, the librarys across the nation have another labeling system like the dewey decimal system but use both. this new system could contain information like reviews from crtics about the book, or what happend during the book. This would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so.     The books, music, magazines found in librarys should be left their for a reason. Sombody wrote, or composed for a reason. so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music"

I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young.     Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence. If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it. When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young.     Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of. Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not. If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong! It is a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying.      Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language. They also should not be watcing anything about violence. Lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying"

man with the child in his eyes.Honestly there's alot of books and magagives that need to be taking off the self. I can remember in the sixth grade going to the schools library and picking up a book that not only told me wha weed was it told me how to grow it! Also alot of book refer to drug and sex now a days and  absolutly hate it! The last book I checked out, even though it is been a while sence ive checked one out, had enough referances to sex that i could honestly say I thought I was read a porn magazine.     Our schools really need to watch what they put onto there selfs. I mean come on sixth graders shouldnt even be able know what weed is! Let alone read about it in school! maybe that why kids get interested in drugs and achole at such an early age. The book I read didnt have any negative satments about the weed. what makes anyone think that a book like that would keep kids from doing drugs?     Like I said before alot of book in schools and pubic librarys have books that refer a lot to drugs and sex. They have books now in our library that tell you what the drugs are, what kind of high it'll give you. And were you can buy the crap to make them!     Ok I know im in highschool but you should have book that seem like pron magazines. The book i read have pictures of postions in it! it broke everything down into details! It even gave websites on the back of the book. And that my friends is not alright. Its just sad.     It is just starting to scare me about what kind of stuff my little brother and little sister could be reading. Doesn't it scare you? I know I dont want my siblings to be reading about drugs and sex in detail. Let alont them reading about it at all. just take the books off the schools and pubic librarys selfs. Hardly anyone will read them anyway. And if they do its by accident like mine incounters where"

No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child"

introduce a friend of ours,   a very talented guy named John Sebastian..The old folks don't talk much   They talk so slowly when they do   They are rich they are poor   Their illusions are gone   They share one heart for two      Their homes all smell of time   Of old photographs   And an old fashioned song   Though you may live in town   You live so far away   When you've lived too long      Have they laughed too much   Do their dry voices crack   Talking of things gone by   Have they cried too much   A tear or two still always seems   To cloud the eye      They tremble as they watch the old silver clock   When day is through   Tick tock oh so slow   It says yes it says no   It says I wait for you      The old folks dream no more   Their books have gone to sleep   The piano's out of tune   The little cat is dead   And no more do they sing on a Sunday afternoon      The old folks move no more   Their world become to small   Their bodies feel like lead   They might look out a window   Or else sit it a chair   Or else they stay in bed      And if they still go out   Arm in arm, arm in arm   In the morning chill   Its to have a good cry   To say their last goodbye   To one who's older still   And then they go home   To the old silver clock   When day is through   Tick tock so so slow   It says yes it says no   It says I wait for you      The old folks never die   They just put down their heads   And go to sleep one day   They will hold each others hands   Like children in the dark   But one will get lost anyway   And the other will remain   Just sitting in a room   Which makes no sound   It doesn't matter now   The song has died away   And echo's all around      You'll see them as they walk   Through the s.Some people get a sadness so long   They just go on thinking it's a

My life ain't no holiday   I've been through the point of no return   I've seen what a man can do   I've seen all the hate of a woman too      And they gave him away   Like in 'Whistle Down The Wind'

own dream   But possessions and concession   Are not often what they seem   They drag you down   And load you down   In disguise of security..The man at the desk said the restaurant was closed   Outside it was 14 below      The lounge was still open and so I walked in   In place of my food I had two double gins   I looked 'round the room, as a tourist would do   That's when I saw the girl in the booth      She sat there and cried in the smoky half-dark   The silent type crying that tears out your heart   Her clothes were not cut in the new modern way   And her suitcase had seen better days      Nobody asked her what caused her such pain   Nobody spoke up, yet no one complained   Without even asking, I knew why she cried   Life is just like that sometimes      The man at the desk said, ""It's 15 below."".But little do they know, I'm just a maybe.. IN MY OPINION I THINK THAT SOME BOOKS PROBABLY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF SOME OF THE BOOKS AREW FOUND OFFENSIVE. SOME OF THE MOVIES AND BOOKS PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE CAN BE PRETTY BAD AND SAY NASTY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.      SOME MUSIC CAN BE PRETTY OFFENSIVE TOO BECAUSE IT CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT ALL MUSIC IS BAD.. IT DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO IF IT SAYS NASTY THINGS BECAUSE THERE IS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TOO."

The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group. Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive.     Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge. They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in.      With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. We cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries"

Why I think these materials should stay well because,  For @CAPS3 lets say its a certain movie or song or book or whatever just that one thing you were looking for, for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happening to go to the library just to look. Even though  you know its not there, but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you where looking for.             And what if you wanted to look for a myster book and only the library had that book you where looking for. I can think of alot of reasons why we need certain materials. well i guess that about sums that up for me.                 And in concultion put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay."

resignation   That's how it is - how it's going to be      It's such a cloudy day   Seems we'll never see the sun   Or feel the day has possibilities   Frozen in the moment -   The lack of imagination   Between how it is and how it ought to be      Here's a little trap   That sometimes trips up everyone   When we tire of our own company   Sometimes we're the last to see beyond the day's frustrations   That's how it is - how it's going to be      It's such a cloudy day   Seems we'll never see the sun   I feel the day is all uncertainty   Burning in the moment - trapped by the desperation   Between how it is and how it ought to be      Foot upon the stair   Shoulder to the wheel   You can't tell yourself not to care   You can't tell yourself how to feel      That's how it is   Another cloudy day.One day I'll always remember   Was when you walked into my life   It was a very special night   When we danced so close, so tender   It gave my heart the second chance   That

But really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter? Well according to some people it does which i can understand but i will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to. Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so i say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, ect.     The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them. Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities, races, ect. When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious. Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it.     Through all of this you should know by now that i don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read. Casue like i already said there are gonna find out about this stuff eventually. So no need getting mad over it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books what  kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read. Casue im pretty sure i dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home."

at eighteen..Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.      Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general"

If an adult is reading a specific book or magazine and they feel @CAPS5's only for their eyes to see @CAPS5 then they should keep that item in a personal place that only he or she knows, not anyone else.      Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. The reason for this is because, @CAPS5's not fair to others who haven't read them, and who would like to read them, but can't because they have been removed to others oppinions. If the books and magazines weren't appropriate for children then the companies wouldn't print them and releasr them to stands for them to be sold. If certain music also wasn't appropriate then music producers wouldn't let artists release that song out on a track.     There are many chances for school projects that @MONTH1 require getting information, but the student who is assigned to get @CAPS5 is not able to, due to the fact that adults think the website @MONTH1 be inappropriate. For example, in history class a student is assigned an assignment to get done over the @DATE2 about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for a grade. @DATE3 comes and he/she doesn't have @CAPS5 and gets a @CAPS4 for the homework he/she was assigned. The student explains why he/she wasn't able to get any information. He/she starts explaing themself by saying 'the websites I went to were blocked. The books and magazines I tried checking out were either thrown out, or I wasn't able to check them out.' '@CAPS5's all because our neighbors who live in this neighborhood think the pictures and words are offensive, and since then the librarians stopped putting them out on shelves.'      The teacher then says, 'well then I will go and sign out a book for you and you can try and get as much information out as you can, how does that sound to you?' '@CAPS6 good, at least @CAPS5's better then getting an @CAPS4 on the assignment,' said the student. @DATE1 @TIME1 comes, adn the student has as much information he/she was able to get out of the two books, and hands @CAPS5 to the teacher. At the end of class @CAPS5 gets graded and the grade on @CAPS5 turns out to be a @CAPS8. Student is happy for picking up the grade but is still unhappy he/she wasn't able to get the items they needed from the start.     This is why movies, books, magazines, or even music should not be removed from shelves. Things like this will probably happen, and the kids will land up getting in trouble for not having the assignment turned in which is not even their fault. If only a few citizens have oppinions about certain items and they feel that those items should be removed, then they should be from their sight, and they shouldn't bother thinking of them. Even if @CAPS5's for safety of the children they @MONTH1 have in the house with them, then they shouldn't even have the books out of the little private personal spot where nobody knows of excpet for that one particular person."

certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you"

three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict.     We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter @CAPS1 precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too yound to see them, like under the age of @NUM1. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though.     @ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occassional '@CAPS1 to wear this @DATE1!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. @ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon.     Say a child around the age of @NUM2 is listening to the new @CAPS2' @PERSON1 song. He is being introduces to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the @NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending @NUM4 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated.     I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconciously) do participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with @CAPS1 it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed."

[?].I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light   Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night   For he might have to kill or walk around a fight      And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun   He won't say how many tried and died   Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run      He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train   Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up   So long Janie chin up I'll be back again      Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried   Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died   And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky      Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did   First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid   So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid      Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign   You won't find him there for business every day at nine   For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time      Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place   Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face   And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace      You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar   She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there   Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far      Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun   Wes Hardin chug-a-luggin' red eye got him in the back of the head   John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldn't run.No eastern kings came bearing gifts..Nothing but a grand illusion,   Legends in our own minds..Roll, roll, roll brother trucker,   Someone to love the truck driving man..I know that she's an angel and they're lettin' her fly   Every plan I thought we made together was a lie   She could of hung on, I bet she didn't even try   She left me dry, and that no one can deny   And when she fall from the sky, I'm askin' her why      [Chorus: x8]   Angels are falling!.Everything changes..Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising.     Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies have are cusswords. Also some @MONTH1 have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff.     Also another thing are advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as its good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in @CAPS1 hand, and we think its cool to try it, but its not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or inscents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college.     The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, @CAPS1 could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines @CAPS1 can be pictures in which you don't approve in either. So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have innapropiate scenes, and innapropiate pictures.     Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising @CAPS1 is. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about."

Beautiful lovers   Lovers ev'rywhere..Everyone today gets offeneded daily. So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelfs is no different than the rest of the day. However, there are those minds, which have not been poluted and influenced by these offensive materials, that should have a right to keep thier minds that way.      One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies. The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the lirary while the lower rated material is put on display for the public. The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public, and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way.     Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material. It, in my opinion and experience, corrupts both the mind and soul, and causes man to be things he is not by nature. Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things ment for inside of marrage, often accoplish nothing of great value in their life time. They are thus a hinderence to soceity. But if they can not accsess the material, they then need something to do to fill that time. In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty @CAPS1 off the shelf.     This thus leaves the labraries with a choice. They can leave their library the way that they want, they can put the offensive material in a seclueded room, or they can remove definent offensive material and keep soceity on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to odserve. Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendence goes up."

Hi my name is @PERSON1 I have a couple topics that I would       like to talk to you about. I have been hearing alot of people          talking about libraries taking alot of there stuff off the shelves      well I think that that the libraries around the world have alot        of information inside of them and if we started taking                  information out of them then what would be the point in              having them. I think that everything in libraries are very               important and who is to know that everybody wants this to          happen. The one thing that I dont really think that libraries           need in them is movies because like pretty much every movie      has a book that goes with it or is the same thing pretty much.       And lets get on with the whole offensive thing I think everone      should be mature about all the negative stuff people can say         even if it is hurtfull. Though I think that the more people read      about what people are saying about them is the less that              they are goin to care because they are goin to just be so used       to it that they are not even goin to know what they are                talking about. If there was one thing that I could tel the world      it would be dont be offened by what people say to you."

First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines.  The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music.  Second, what @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case.  There is no need for an angry public or strikes.  Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to.  After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning.  So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from thier shelves that are found offensive.     First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library.  For example, one person @MONTH1 like to read philosophical books, and the other @MONTH1 like to read romance comedy books.  If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read.  Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading  @ORGANIZATION2's book, or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1.  I had an experience similar to this with my friend.  She preferred horror movies, and I historical.  The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city.  My friend was not happy.  The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public.     Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings.  What @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 not seem offensive to another.  An example:  a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover @MONTH1 be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child.  However, that same cover @MONTH1 be interesting to a young adult because he @MONTH1 be into surfing, suntanning, or @CAPS2.  Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used.  So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so.  The solution is for the child to look at @CAPS4 Magazines, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS5 magazines.  The library should provide a section for @ORGANIZATION1 so that they can read appropriate material.     Finally, I believe that the peole have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to.  They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music.  They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities.  After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment.  The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer.     In conclusion, I belive that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive.  This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', the for the sake of human flourishment.  Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place.  They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education."
"Won't stop to surrender..I'm just a red blooded boy   And I can't stop thinkin' about   Girls!.Ay!.And the strippers start to fade away      It's pudding time!.Why did you stick in self deprecating bones and skin?.Good-bye Sue,   All the best of luck to you!.A maid..Don't know why   I have to drive so fast   My car has nothing to prove   It's not new   But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2      Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done   Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun   All I really gotta do is live and die   But I'm in a hurry and don't know why      Can't be late   I leave plenty of time   Shaking hands with the clock   I can't stop   I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock      Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done   Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun   All I really gotta do is live and die   But I'm in a hurry and don't know why      I hear a voice   That say's I'm running behind   I better pick up my pace   It's a race   And there ain't no room   For someone in second place..Don't ask me why, it's my mind ,   It's better, it's better than being alone,   Alone on the ground..(the long road)   There's no need to say goodbye..There's a fire that burns in our hearts   To see the lost return   To the Father   And it's a passion that's not of our own   We have seen it in the Son   In the face of the Son      Wonderful Counsillor   Mighty God, Eternal Father   Prince of Peace.Ever since I was a little child   I was told to do no wrong   The angel in my mama's   Precious eyes   Could be a devil with a heart   Of stone      I couldn't help myself,   Just had to go my way   Now I've got hell to pay      [Chorus]   Yeah I'm a twisted angel   Flying wild and free   Yeah I'm a twisted angel   Flying to heaven on a   Broken wing      Back when I was daddy's little girl   He brought me up on the   Rolling Stones   Thrown into the flame,   Thrown into the world   That's when I learned how   To rock n' roll      Look's like everything   Has gone my way   But I've still got hell to raise      [Chorus]      My mama taught me right   But the devil's up my sleeve   It's made me kind of crazy   But it's all right with me      [Chorus].Hooray, now back in your cells,   We've President Kill instead..Without you, what would a poor boy do?.I can't believe it's happened to me   I can't conceive of any more misery..Search in vane?.What it your eyes close before mine?.Am I lying to you when I say   That I believe in you   I believe in you..Do you know?.Your gonna take this!.Seems my destiny, Captain Fantasy   Take a minute to go down beneath the reaches of sound   You could be with me, Captain Fantasy      And when I'm there, I'm here   And when you're near, I'm there   The only words of your life, Captain Fantasy   And when I'm here, I'm there   And when you're near, I'm here   The only words of your life, Captain Fantasy      Please would you like to be somewhere floating free?.(Love me, hate me) Yeahh, say what you want about me   (La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la)      So tell me if you see her   (Let me know what she was wearing and what she was like)   Cause I've been waiting here forever   (Let me know where she was going I don't mind)      Oh baby, baby, if you seek Amy tonight (Oh!).Many places show and sell offensive material. It is found almost everywhere. Many people try to shelter their kids from it but the truth is if the kids really want to look at it they are going to find a way. So I do not think all offensive material should be removed from shelves but sometimes things can offend more than one person in which case they @MONTH1 need to be removed.       Take music for example, there @MONTH1 be explicit lyrics in songs but that doesn't make them terrible or make them worth taking off the shelf. Music is everywhere and if someone tells you can't listen to it over a few words then they are going to find a way to listen to it.     Movies @MONTH1 be different. For some you do have to be a certain age and that is because of the offensive material. But still some people go see it anyways knowing that there will be offensive material in there but they go and see it and then complain about how offensive it was. Movies should not be pulled off the shelf because it is your choice if you want to watch it or not and if you choose not to there will always be someone who chooses to watch it.     Books @MONTH1 be the only exception. Many people read books and many do enjoy it but many people do find books offensive. Now with music and movies people know they aren't real its just talk or acting. But some books are written by people with the actual beliefs they write about. which is why some books might be pulled off shelves because if one person believes something it won't be hard to convince somebody else.       There is a big difference between choosing not to look or listen to something than being told you cannot look at something. All the things that show explicit material have some type of warning for it and if you choose to keep reading or listening it is your decision."

Books ranging from children's to difficult adult ones. It's nice to know that you have many options and freedom to pick whatever book you would like to read. Censorship is the censoring of a piece of material so it is not legally or publically available. If a book was censored because of the contents inside it would bring into question other books or media related to it.     I believe that if books, magazines, movies, etc. were censored in a library the material wouldn't have a chance to be exposed to people. Some people write books and songs to express themselves or make money. If a book is taken out of a library other libraries will have to remove it also, and other libraries won't buy it. Some people just wish to get there thoughts out and share their message with other people. Censorship in a way stops the flow of what people learn.      Another part about censorship is where to draw the line on what is offensive enough to be censored. If a book is removed from the library for its contents, people will look into as to why it was removed. It gets people thinking as to what other books are also offensive. The reason why one book is removed could relate to another book and could get that one to be removed also. Since censorship is probably mostly opinion, there is no clear boundary as to what can sit on the shelf and what can't.     With censorship you are only stripping the freedom of press away from people. If a publishing company accepts a piece of media only to have is censored later on, this might mean we need new publishers, or that they are also interested in getting what people have to say out into the world. The boundary for censorship is very opinionated and should not be dictated by a single group. When one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question. Those are my beliefs about censorship in the library"

There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic @CAPS1 about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this @CAPS1 and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad @CAPS1. There is only people who are not yet ready for the @CAPS1 they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines,  and movies be censored? That answer is yes.     First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds. If the @CAPS1 given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become.     Secondly, @CAPS1 presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly. Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe. This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly. If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed.      Lastly, premature @CAPS1 can harm mentaly. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked.     In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not beleive that the materials that @MONTH1 be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world"

you hear   My dear      The seven things I hate about you   The seven things I hate about you   Oh, you   You're vain, your games, you're insecure   You love me, you like her   You made me laugh, you

thing I hate the most that you do   You make me love you      Compared to all the great things   That would take too long to write   I probably should mention   The seven that I like      The seven

see him fail   Filling their hearts with jealousies   Crazy people with love so frail   The people were intrigued   His wife held back her fears   The headlines gave acclaim   He'd realized their dreams   Faster than a bullet from a gun   He is faster than everyone   Quicker than the blinking of an eye   Like a flash you could miss him going by   No one knows quite how he does it   But it's true, they say   ""He's the master of going faster""   No need to wonder why   His wife held back her fears   So few have even tried   To realize their dreams   Faster than a bullet from a gun   He is faster than everyone   Quicker than the blinking of an eye   Like a flash you could miss him going by   No one knows quite how he does it   But it's true, they say   ""He's the master of going

When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media.     I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts.     Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to opress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control.     Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger, it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child @MONTH1 descide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities."

Things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things.     I personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted.     I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. @PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect on life. If something causes someone else harm we should not do it.     This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive!     I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them."

Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.      As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.      However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, @CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests.      This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their @CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.      I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or @CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened. This is why I feel books should stay where there are"

There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know. Libraries are out to make money thats all. Let them make money, they can sell whatever they want.      If I had a library I would sell just about anything i could. people will: watch, listen, read anything. So why not sell it or rent it out. It's a honest way of making money."

While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere.     To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well its not; banning books, music, etc. is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity. It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past.     Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remeber the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions.     A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away.     While yes, there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing"

Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on.     I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be that is concidered offensive to some people. Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent. If a person were to watch an @CAPS1-@CAPS2 movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be @NUM1 years of age or older. That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing.      Parents should, also, definitely be the one's to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children for the most part don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only.    These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want to because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities. The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer. Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you.     There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad. It's all in how these people being are raised, and were raised as a child themselves. If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive. These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials, therefore these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent.     If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then, what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive? What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things? Not every person in this world has the same opinion.     In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear is up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to. This is @LOCATION2, let's not be overly strict about things."

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Author, Katherine Paterson. She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we can not take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read. I agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library. We can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways. It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors freedom of the press, who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship. These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong.     Taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gives all @CAPS5 citizens the freedom of the press. This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions. If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 include a few controversial things we are violating there natural right. Which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge?     So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong. So, who are we supposed to believe? On person @MONTH1 think somthing is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary. That is what makes this country great. We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal. If the government would assign someone to censoring books, magazines, or music, there would be a uproar. How can one person say if something is wrong? And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included? How far is to far?     This is a hard question to ask. If we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included? Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music? Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles? If we implement this system of censorship, our who lives would become one big judgement. Self expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inapropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward.     There are always going to be those people who disagree with things. They find it out of place or offensive. What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways. We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary, and try to understand where otheres are comming from. If we can do that our world would be a much better place"

movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language.     Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it.      Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them. I think that cencorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere."

Yes because certain things need to be removed from the shelves for example many things that don't need to be seen out in public. Personaly I think censoring certain things is alright because there are certain books that shouldn't be seen, music that has either swearing talking about drugs or other things, movies that kids shouldn't see like the rated '@CAPS1' or '@NUM1' that has either blood or nudity or somethen on that line, and magazines now magazines there are many types of magazines like for example adult, children, cooking, cleaning, house things, stuff for dogs or cats, and outside stuff.      But censoring things that could be 'offensive' I can't understand how books can be offensive because some books are talking about history or something that has happen to them. Like for example lets just say a colored kid comes in and reads a book on '@CAPS2 slavery' that kid right there is going to get offensive about it and then that kid is going to say 'You owe me something because my anscetores were slaves' no your very wrong there kid because you either read the book wrong or you just didn't understand it. I have done that a couple of times either I got offensive about it and started getting very angry about it or just tose it in the trash because I got mad because I got offensive about it. Don't get me wrong I love reading but like I said before certain things are just ment to never be read or just never be found.     But as for me getting offensive about a couple of books, movies, music, or magazines @CAPS13 I don't read magazines so I can't get offensive about that but books, movies, and music I take very offesively because like if I read lets just say the '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' and then I watch the movies @CAPS13 I take it offensively because nothing didn't tie in with the books or that person didn't direct it right.      For books like I said I love reading books don't get me wrong but I do take very offensively because like something the character did or something that I wished I shouldn't have done something like that or a character dies and it reminds me of a close friend of mine or a teacher something on that line I either cry or I just stop reading the book period.     Music now I could go all day on that because for example I used to love rap with a passion but now rap is just becoming horrible because the rapper is either talking about killing someone, drugs, or 'sex' it's like I said 'horrible' thats one thing that needs to go away for a long long time. But there are many other types besides rap. There is @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7 @CAPS8, punk, @CAPS1&@CAPS10, etc like I said I could go all day on music.     The people who are censoring things like t.v. shows like for example @CAPS11 @CAPS12 seriously there is nothing wrong with that show some people are censoring that because adults think it is bad @CAPS13 people there is nothing bad with that show. I have been watching it since I was five years old and there was nothing bad on it then, then why would there be something bad on it now. All there is, is a grown man acting like a child it's like your going to tell your husband or your wife or your kids '@CAPS13 @CAPS14 I'm sorry but I have to censore you because your a bad person.'      I'm not saying that I would censore it I'm just saying maybe we as people should just take the time to look through some of these shows before censoring them.                                                              @PERSON1"

It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today. Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace.

Once the automatic  doors to the library opened she darted straight to the movie section. I couldnt help but laugh, because I knew thats why she truly wanted to go to the library. When i asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over with no reservation and, said' @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. 'I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6', I thought silently to myself. Then i realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information.      I agree with the statement of @PERSON1 in some degree. I believe if we started taking certian information away completly we would find ourselves ignorant. But when we let  our children ,the future of the world, vonerable to adult information they are greatly effected, @CAPS9 teens and violent video games, or explicit magazines. For example my niece is able to check out any book in the library, books like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 famous book intitled '@CAPS12 @CAPS13 ', which means my struggle in german. My @NUM1 year old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable as are many young children.     Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored, this includes public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and @CAPS14. I believe books should be censored by content much like movies. This makes the distibutor left responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effect"

I believe that in order for a library to censor or remove books, magazines, movies, music, etc., it depends on @CAPS1 the subject matter of those things are about.      It's also the parent's job to monitor @CAPS1 their kids read, listen to, or watch. @CAPS2's no reason for a library to censor and take away books because one or two parents complain that it's inappropriate, when the parent can just pull their kids away from the book or movie and move on to something else. It's not the libraries job to watch kids and make sure they don't read, listen to, or watch anything bad. It's the parent's job.      Katherine Paterson, an author, had a good point, also. She said that if she has the right to take books off the shelf, then so does everyone else. If everyone else starts taking books off the shelf, we have no books left. Everyone has a different view of books. @CAPS1 one person thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. It goes the other way, too: @CAPS1 one person thinks is good, another @MONTH1 think is bad. On the subject of movies, @CAPS2 are some that should be censored, like the movies containing extreme violence or gore. I remember going to the library when I was a kid, and I wanted to check out a @CAPS3 movie. I couldn't check it out because I wasn't at least @NUM1. I though it was ridiculous because it was only a @CAPS3 movie, and it was harmless.      With magazines and music, it depends on the subject matter of those as well. Some magazines contain inappropriate pictures and articles for young kids, and it's those things that should be kept away from the kids. They don't neccessarily need to be censored or taken away, just kept in another section for teens and adults. The music poses a problem, though. A lot of the music these days can be very inappropriate, especially rap music. Music that sends negative messages and contains a lot of cursing in the lyrics should be censored, in my opinion. It doesn't belong in a library environment where young kids are roaming around and where they're influenced by it.      In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should or should not be censored or removed based on the subject. It just depends on @CAPS1 the subject is about and how inappropriate it is. @CAPS1 one parent thinks is bad, another @MONTH1 not. Overall, I think that books, music, movies, and magzines shouldn't be censored. Parents can just decide @CAPS1 they want their kid(s) to read, watch, or listen to"

Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In todays world it is hard to please every living soul. Every one is going to disagree about something in there life time.      Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or to. People @MONTH1 interpride it different than others. Therefore I personally dont think they should take articules out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornograh then they should deffently take it out.     My conclusion is that you cant please everybody. I think that you shouln't take things out of the library that can help a student learn."

Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine. No one is the same, we all have different likes and interest.      Some people @MONTH1 find certain books distrubing and inapporiate, that the book shouldnt be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries. That is only some people, what one person finds distrubing and gross another person can find interesting. Not one person is the same so not all books are going to be eye ctaching and interesting to every person. If one person finds a book to be inapporaite, yet another finds it interesting and suggest that book to their friends, is that one whom disagress upon the reading material as unexceptable to thier community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it. Everyone should be given the same oppertunity to read the book that another made find inapporaite.     People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only. A child in the library can wonder over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those women, that mother doesnt want her child to be able to pick up and porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library. You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazine in adult stores where childern wont be able to view them. Now some books @MONTH1 have a naked picture in the text but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well educate the people in our society about the matter. Books of diseases that @MONTH1 have nude photos should be allowed, they educate the communitry and save lives. Although not one persons voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, we all should be heard. Books are as of the same way, they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitment, sorrow and anger. We all have different hungrys for different reading, music and fashin.     In this world today, in our society, and in our community there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library. Books were created by different people, who dont share the same views,who look upon life in a different way, whose voices arent all the same. The book has a curse word in the text, that doesnt mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community. That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life.       Everyone has different views, likes, interest, wants and needs. Not one person shares the same hunger of reading material. We should all be given the oppertunity to read or not read what another person finds inapporaite. The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unexecptable for the shelves of their local library. Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implyed with the pursuite to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person. Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many imapporaite context is included.Let everyone read as they please and let everyone be marry in what they read"

been a discussion about different things in libraries.  And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation.  There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate.  Many people have differnt opinions then other people. Everyone had a differnt point of view and sees things differently.  Ecspecially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.     I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate.  The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it.  And if she finds it not approprite then she has the right to take it off the shelf.     If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not apropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library.  Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area.       I have actaully had an experience with this.  At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate.  When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books.  The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library.  So she had a great idea.  She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk.  If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book.  It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldnt even see them.  And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.     Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material.  Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in.     I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone.  Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too.  I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme.  There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoyes the stuff there.  There should be action,adventure, humor, love, etc.  Talk to people and see what they like.  And just because one person complains, dont take it out right away because to another person they might love it.  Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped"

Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc."

see. In the kids section, they have kid's books. In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @MONTH1 be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@CAPS5' or '@ORGANIZATION1' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience.      That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated @CAPS4 but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out. Just make a new section for it."

If you walk into a store or video store there are so many different things that children are exposed to. They see things and then seeing them makes them think that kind of stuff is @CAPS1. I believe that there should be a very limited selection that children can see. Things that are inappopreite should not be visable to children. I think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else. Also the music on the radio is censored yes but it doesn't mean that people don't know what the words are. There are people that get affended by certain words and they are still on the radio, on @CAPS2, in books. They are everywhere. Things would be completely different if people would watch what they put in stuff. It makes people expecly children believe that certain things are @CAPS1 and they are not. We should have very strict rules on things like that so then nothing inapporpreite is shown to people making them believe it is all @CAPS1. There are rules now on things like that but it doesn't mean that underage children are still getting to see this kind of stuff. That's why I believe there is so much violence now because children are plating video games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 and when they see shooting and stuff they think it's @CAPS1 and they grow up believing that. I am writing this paper today to ask of an article in the paper on stricter rules for these kinds of things and maybe it will start to make things such as violence less"

censorship in libraries.I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In todays generation everyone has their own opinon on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things.     Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out. For example if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do ? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library.     Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch,and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have differnt interests. Not everyone likes the same things.     In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school there is so much more to learn. People can go to librarys' and learn about differnt things that they want to learn about. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to @CAPS1.If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to. Libraries can not censor  their materials!     I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public.People are differnt and that is okay. If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opprotunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want. Not every parents chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore kids have different interests. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things. The librarys' who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have a equal chance to learn. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines"

apart   She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same   Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel   My belle of Ponchartrain   We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked   We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same   And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money   And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine   She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me   I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again   I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore   And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain   Dorraine, I called Dorraine   Come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain   The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return   But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine   As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start   To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain   At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all   And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine   But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat   For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain   Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away   And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain   Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore   Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine   Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel   My belle of

I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear.     If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions. Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it. You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion.     Library's are everywhere. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down in sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most.      We live in @LOCATION1, which since founded has been all about freedom. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf. There is also a religion conflict. There are many different versions of the @CAPS1 but, many different religions. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the @CAPS1 do we take that off the shelves too?      In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish"

There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others.     There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.     The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read.     So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone"
"And when we buried him beneath the willow   The angels sang a whiskey lullaby      The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself   For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath   She finally drank her pain away a little at a time   But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind   Until the night      She put that bottle to her head and pulled the

has in store for us   The race for economy   Makes people forget   The lives around this planet   As men become more egoistic   Pretty soon, there will be nothing in this world   For men to spare   Stupidity   Causing pain   And sickness   To our world   Suffer   Chorus   On the burial ground   Is what this planet is all about   It's where we are right now   We might not have any future to be found   On this burial ground   We have nowhere to hide   Death is laughing at our crimes   And now we are feeling the effects   That the forces of nature has brought   The droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions   It's getting worse than ever before   We can see the revenge of this planet upon us   As we keep hurting the sea, the soil and the air   Sometimes some catastrophic accidents happen   Causing death rate and we wonder from where   People are dying in civilizations of different lands   Because of drought   Occurrences of flooding everywhere   Killing innocent people and leaving others in despair   Abomination because people fear that all these events   Happen without any warning killing unexpectedly   Men subjugate the forces of nature   But we don't know that it's destroying us slowly   The animals are becoming extinct   Seas and rivers polluted by toxic waste   Combustible smoke   Factories are creating acid rains   That is burning our skins, damaging plantations   And soon it will us to death   Air pollution is disintegrating our atmosphere   Allowing the ultra-violet rays to burn the earth   Ad to provoke us fear   Chorus   On the burial ground   Is what this planet is all about   It's where we are right now   We might not have any future to be found   On this burial ground   We have nowhere to hide   Death is laughing at our cries   Soon some of the lives on this planet   Won't exist anymore   Because we won't be able to recreate   Some of the beauty that we had before   Nobody seems to care   About the future of our children's civilizations   We better act now   So they won't have a life of torment and frustration   Stupidity   Causing pain   Punishment for violating   The ecologic balance   Chorus   On the burial ground   Is what this planet is all about   It's where we are right now   We might not have any future to be found   On this burial ground   We have nowhere to hide   Death is laughing at our face   Cursed by men this world has become   We are building our own tombs   By eliminating our source of life   When blindly we continue the destructions   There's no future   Day by day we are reaching the end of our lives.No stranger am I   You enter my world   I hear flowers sing   No emptiness now   You enter my world   Hear flowers with me   Sing joyous      I feel you 'er I sing   No unending time alone

secrets, will you keep mine?.People all judge things differently. Thats why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What @MONTH1 be found as a offenisve book to one person might not to another one. If there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive.          What might be offensive to one person @MONTH1 interest another. The person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it.           I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and @MONTH1 have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or waching then it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. Thats not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group.          I understand the fact that some people take things offensively. Also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library.                     All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is"

in the libraris  would be liked cutting the worlds air supply. It would be taking away from a readers imagintion. stoping readers from being able to express their mind.      My veiw on censorship in the libraries would not be needed. Libraries around the world do good jobs keeping certain books in the apperpate ages levels. By removing certain materials out of libraries would cause reader attention to why their being removed. Then readers would demanded that we leave their books alone. Then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries.      Books were made to keeping people wondering, learning, and excited. By cutting away different materials would be stopping people from enjoying the world of minds. More you take books away the more the population on watching television gets higher. Then there would be no more author and more actors and actress. People minds would not be wondering, learning or being kept excited.      I remember when i was a little girl i went to the library. I was in the library looking for a book. I wet to the big kids side as i called it and tried to check the book out. The library lady told me i was to young and showed me to my age level books and took the book back. Then i was able to check a book out.      So all i am sating is that censorships are not needed in libraries. That would be tking away from a librarains job. So dont take away readrs imagintion"

And some people @MONTH1 feel the need to remove books of their choosing but, I also say that if the library sees it fit to put such books on their shelves that is their problem. I believe that if you do not like the books then stay away from them. Now if the books are only meant to be seen by adult eyes then, yes by all means remove them. I personally know parents that would not allow their childern to need a book just because in the review they read the main characters kissed. I find it rediculous, but that is the way they parent their kids. And as long as they dont take it upon themselves to force they parenting methods on to libraries and other learning places just because of the books I am fine with it.      I find that some people see books on slavery and the holocost and such topics to be offensive. I see those books as our history, those topics are taught to us in school and we will most likely hear about such things as we grow up. What is the difference between learning about them now and learning about them as a adult? People seem to be trying to shield the world from thing like swear words. Why? If a book has a few curse words oh well, tell your kids to stay away from it if you think its bad. But, do not take it upon yourself to remove that book from our library. People have different views, we always have and we always will. If a parent feels so strongly about a few books get a postition and get signatures saying that these books should be removed or atleast moved to a different part of the library. Do not force your thoughts on some one else"

They should be in the other room to where you have to have like a id to get in. They should make sure about this cause you dont want your little son looking at like playboy. I know i dont.     Little kids should not be reading books with alot of swearing and evrything cause no kid needs to act like that. It bothers them they could get in trouble with school and at home.     Yes it @MONTH1 be true that adults like to read about sex, and drugs but do we really want our kids reading the same stuff that we read. Some people just need to think about what they just leaving out in the librarys because little kids loves to see new stuff all the time.     So next time you working at the library or just there vistiing you might wanna watch where you put stuff at cause little kids will see it."

Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do?      Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music"

From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or  any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they @MONTH1 become violent or depressed. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediatley.     Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they @MONTH1 imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind.      Another reason why  libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing , so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy.      Finally , inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a @CAPS1  in a magazine, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they @MONTH1 want to try and experiment with drugs  themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them.      Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media , they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which , inturn , can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy. With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths ,and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted , with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves"

Sixth Sense   She said she wanna fuck my brains out   But she gonna have to suck this dick first!.Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive."

I don't think that they should be removed from the shelfs. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To were no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's volgar or sexual. Then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person @MONTH1 love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you @MONTH1 have a person who is real religous and can't stand to see it.      There are very many view points of this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style. Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight. Should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?     Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it @MONTH1 affect the kids reading habbits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more. Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.     My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in controle of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away."

If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are ment for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with '@CAPS1 does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know @CAPS1 to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.           When parents going through the explaination of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and i would not want a child reading a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a @CAPS4 your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.      Young kids and teens can always find things that they should notat certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now."

If the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magizines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books , movies, and magizines would not return to the library any more.           For example, I like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. But, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. If your with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people @MONTH1 not like it. This doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them.          Libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magizine or rent a movie, that they should have the childs parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magizine, or movie. Libraries should have an age limint to check out books and magizines. If kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned. This permission slip will and can be used for all movies.           Libraries should not remove their books, magizines, or movies. They should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out. So, library material should be a choice"

blank sheet of paper   This fool's about to write you a letter   To tell you that he's sorry for the way he did you wrong   To ask for your forgiveness for leaving you alone   He's been looking down at me, seems like forever   Takes the top on and off his pen   It's like he can't decide just what he wants to say   If he'd just tell the truth, I'd be on my way   But he just stares at me   I just stare at him   He don't know where to start   To say he doesn't want it to end   And now it's one hour later   And I am still a blank sheet of paper      Sunlight is shining through the curtains   He's almost asleep, pen in hand   There's a tear in his eye that refuses to fall   If it would land on me, that would say it all   But he just stares at me   I just stare at him   He don't know where to start   To say he doesn't want it to end   And now it's four hours later   And I am still a blank sheet of paper      And he just stares at me   I just stare at him   He don't know where to start   To say he wants it back again   And now one broken heart later   I am still a blank sheet of paper.Love me now.Lovin', yeah, yeah   Little Miss..Oy vey, oy vey!.They need to remove the bookstors because all studeds wants that the library have many books like spanish books or the diffrent culture, and the students can knows diffrent languges or that they can do many this with that books.  Like example they can read load and also they can do the same book with others words.                                                                                      And also the music and movies they need to remove because     some dvds are spokeds thats they need to remove.      For example librarys in the world that the need to borrow somes books for many people took, and the people can takes the book without pay nothing, thats the people want that the librarys are free.  Also the librarys need to spants with many parts in the world that many people think that did's great idea because many people said no because the librarys can't not borrow a books or dvds,  magazines, etc.   Thats why the librarys need that the people know that the   librarys not borrows books thats happed in the world....  I think the librarys need to do is go with the people and show what they have in the library and borrow books dvds thats the people want too... sometimes the library can rent the dvds that are interesting that the people can't find in the other place, like movies new but if the library not have the dvds somes people can go to the library and give to the bookstor that you can find in the other place. would we have to read more like many people do thats great idea. And the library need more style for the people are excited and take the books and read."

Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves?     I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world"

Whether a certain piece of material is considered offensive and should be censored or not is more often opinionated rather than logically opposed, because it really does all come down to someone's opinion on this matter. It is too difficult for most people to step in someone else's shoes or be persuaded from a viewpoint different from their own or even escape pressures from the general public to consider something else. Things get censored for a lot of reasons, too! Sometimes they're just so intentionally offensive that perhaps the author or producer wants it to be censored or would appreciate the controversy, or that a new view or opinion is so radical and against a majority of the population that it is just considered offensive for being so different. Well, when does someone have a right to take a song off the air or pull a book permanently from a shelf?     The first thing that needs to be contemplated is if something is offensive or not. There are extremes to pieces of media where one sometimes must ask, '@CAPS1 were they thinking when they made that?' A movie being so outrageously graphic or violent is a fine example (although the same thing can happen in books, just with words instead of pictures). At the same time though, whether or not something you might think as unnecessary gore in a film might just be @CAPS1 I'm excited to see when I go to the cinema - it's all opinionated!          Another interesting thought is that somebody might come up with a revolutionary, radical scientific theory and write a whole novel or film a documentary explaining it all, but certain groups of people might claim that it is offensive to them. However, we might investigate into that theory ourselves and not be offended in the slightest. This is understandable though, people grow up in an environment that has its own set of ethics and principles, and people will honestly believe them and probably stick with those fundamentals throughout their lifetime. If you go against someone's beliefs that they hold so dear like that, they would of course be offensive to them. Does that mean that the something should be censored just because it offends a couple of groups in a population?     Whether or not something is to be torn from the access of the public is left up to the opinions of the general public themselves. The opinion of the public is created by the current time, trends, ethics, and problems that are going on. When something goes against too many of those things, people get upset. If most people are upset by something, it will probably start disappearing from sight. It's bad for business, and libraries are losing customers already due to most people not having an urge to read anymore with all of the stuff that you can do otherwise. Certain things can just put a bad taste in your mouth, and if someone gets that too often when they go to a library, they probably won't go there anymore.     So when it comes down to censorship in libraries, or anywhere, its just a bunch of opinions. If the general public does not like something, it will stop showing up. Certain books or other pieces of media are asking for the controversy that many subjects bring, while others are just unintentionally going against certain groups of people. People's beliefs are determined by where they grew up and when, and they'll hold on to those things for their lifetime. If something goes against those, people will be offended, and if enough people are upset, it gets taken away"

They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why.     I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen. let them do what they want to"

If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves.     I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance.      I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point. Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up. Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out.      Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others.     In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves"

I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not ment to offend people, but just to let the reader know how the author feels. I think that the books, movies, magazines, etc. should stay on the shelf because if they are removed what are we left with? Seems like all that would remain would be the dictonary. I think that when Katherine Paterson said, 'Children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that she was making a big mistake.      So what seems to be offensive to people? Topics such as gosip and politics are a gold mine for authors in the @DATE1. Yet people find these topics to be offense probably due to that persons backround. If aomeone find a read to be offensive, then they should stop reading and that be it. Instead, people deside to go on a rampage against that magazine or whatever they read and what it banned for life from others to read. Readers have the choice to read whatever they want and if they disagree with that subject, just move on with their lifes.      At the library I attend many poeple different shapes and sizes walk through the door everyday. Many of them like a different subject then the others, so its commen to find everybody reading about a different topic. Sure someone here and there does not gree with an author, but never decide to go crazy about it. Instead they just go pick a different read to enjoy for themselves. People read what they want to so they can enjoy it, not to bash the wuthor for his writing.          In my own read's, I have found at times stuff i disagree with. Instead of going off the deep end and getting all excited about it, I choose to think about where the author is coming from and try to understand his side. On the other hand, some movies are ment to be for one type of audience when instead another audience see's the material. This still should not get movies or whatever the material is banned from the library. When on the box it says rated for teenagers and up, that means it is not for a four year old to watch and their parents get mad at them for it. If people followed what the box says and listen to the guidlines, then there would be no problem.     I disagree with @PERSON2 when she said that some books, magazines, movies, etc. should be removed from the library. People have the right to read anything and to see anything they want, and if they disagree well they should just deal with it. In my own exprience, I have not found there to be a problem in my community library with people wanting content removed. Once people start following guidlines and reading the boxes and still disagree, then maybe will have something then. But until then, we should keep our nations libraries the way they are today"

A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently.     In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it.     Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts.     I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials."

Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1. or @CAPS2. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     In my conclusion, about this article. I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries"

If there is a group of people that are interested in a book and want to read it more then once they will like telling a new person about it. Then if another student has decided they don't like the book and they don't want anyone else reading it becuase they find it offensive then I honestly believe it shouldn't be taking off the shelves.      I think it would be different if everyone found the book offensive, but if it's just one or two people complaining then I don't think they should take it down and ruin it for everybody else. It's just a book and students should know just because it's there doesn't mean its directed towards them. I think they should overlook it.     If your playing some music, dacing around, and just having fun with it then thats good. Now, if there is cussing and talking about drugs and those sort of things in a song then don't play it in a school system or around someone that @MONTH1 be religious or against that kind of thing because they @MONTH1 not like it and think that your into that sort of things. They might not want to be around you as much. Show them respect and play something everyone can have fun with. So if the libary has this type of music it should be monitored as to who checks it out.     Movies are something you have to look out for too. Movies already have ratings so this kind of helps for people to check them out and make sure the movie would be safe to watch. If your getting movies from the libary then I would think it would already been watched by an adult there to make sure it can be watched by a student or a child. I wouldnt want my little sibblings watching something that they didn't need to see or hear.     You have to watch out for magazines too. You want a magazine that is going to be interesting and clean. Kids @MONTH1 not know what is bad from good, but you still have teenagers. You don't want kids seeing nudity, cussing, or drugs in any magazine. If I were to walk in a library and see those kind of things in a magazine I would suggest you to take it off the shelves. I would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things. I wouldn't want them thinking about doing anything bad like they saw in the magazine. I'm just looking out for their safety.     Libraries @MONTH1 always need advice. They need to always have an eye out for things and make sure everything is clean and so that everyone can look at it, read it, or watch it. I'm glad we have these safety ideas for kids. I hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things. I know I if I were to ever have children I would want them around something they understand and know, nothing bad and harmful. So thanks to libraries that have an eye out for things like this"
"Na na, na na, na na, na na..And do you really, really drive this way   Just to piss me off?.When I was a young man I busted my jeans hopping a freight down to New Orleans   Worked on the oil rigs and played in the bars but nothing ever killed me so far   Now I'm waitin' on the other shoe to fall and right now you're walking out on me   I can hear your footsteps going down the hall   And I am waitin' on the other shoe to fall      [Fiddle]      Well I joined the army and I did my time they sent me right up to the front lines   People were shoutin' and shootin' at me but I had to keep America free   Now I'm waitin' on the other shoe to fall...

dying for   Who will take the blame   Why did they make a war   Questions that come again   Should we be fighting at all      Once a ploughman hitched his team   Here he sowed his little dream   Now bodies arms and legs are strewn   Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom   Each moment's like a year   I've nothing left inside for tears   Comrades dead or dying lie   I'm left alone asking why

music   When I hear the music   Let it play, Let it play      Life's just rented space, Gettin' laid to waste   When the lines on my face say I'm growing older   Just a stitch in time, Gonna save my

Damn I miss you      [Chorus]      [Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.].In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be.     The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals; but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities. Most children from ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers. Now the library is not a place where a child can recieve adult information right? Wrong! the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage. A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take ones innocence. Some parents in sociey believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm free enviornment to raise children. Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance.     The media draws it's attention to captivate our children. We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight year old daughter. She believes that she can recieve surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use. He will think its ok to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher. Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught.     In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain. We should teach our children that life is better explored through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. Parents should feed kids 'imagination' and not feed their 'image'. Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience; but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library."

Books all have those things to someone some where. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.     Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials.      Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist.     The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let @CAPS1 speek their beliefs.     Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who @MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life"

that I was sorry   But I heard them all singing for comfort and peace   And in my confusion here I still believe      You are the one to make me cry   You were the one to take me home   Of all the people in my life   My thoughts keep returning to you   But consciousness is fading fast      Surrounded by sights that go on living   Make circles in time, the spider web spinning   But I have no illusions of where I am now   I'll let this wave take me and draw me down      You are the one to make me cry   You were the one to take me home   Of all the stories in my life   Only good things return to you   If I could only say the words   If you could hear me cry for help   But I'd lift my head up to the sky   But the planes that were circling now have gone.Sometimes they're in a bottle   Sometimes a pair of high heal shoes   Some come rolled in paper   Some have six strings and only play the blues   Once you meet the devil   There's no way he'll let you be   When I'm not chasing demons   There's demons chasing me      Skeletons in closets   Ghost underneath the bed   They hide out in pictures   And in words better left unsaid   They hang around like perfume   And haunt me like an ancient melody   When I'm not chasing demons   There's demons chasing me      [Chorus:]   There's things I can?t leave alone   'Cause they won't leave me alone   What I want ain't what I need   Still I reach for the things I crave   Better try to runaway   Maybe I'm afraid of being free   When I'm not chasing demons   There's demons chasing me      So roll one up and light it   Pickup my old guitar   I'm playing crossroads   Drinkin' whiskey from the mason jar   There's heartache at my front door   Says she needs my company   When I'm not chasing demons   There's demons chasing me      [Chorus]      When I'm not chasing demons   There's demons chasing me      There's demons chasing me   There's demons chasing me      When I'm not chasing demons   There's demons chasing me      There's demons chasing me   There's demons chasing me   There's demons chasing me   There's demons chasing me      When I'm not chasing demons   There's demons chasing me.Written on the back of my

certain materials such as books, music,            magazines, ect should be removed from the shelves.              Libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to          know more information about something the library or the @CAPS2 should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the           Libraries and the @CAPS1 started putting these materials away, many people wouldnt bother to go to either. The @CAPS2 in my      eyes is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been threw, and things we have accomplished while we           have been there.In the @CAPS1 could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about you past?,'No, I couldn't.          Eventhough things @MONTH1 seem offensive in ones eyes, it could be the history of anothers. Many people now days relie on the           useage of the magazines, books,and music to get information from. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has                happened in their pass to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone           else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in lilbraries, @CAPS1, art shows because everything has it's on history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know. I myself, 'would want to know, than not to ever have known.'"

know your are going to find something interesting to read,listen to, or even watch. Most people use librarys to find information on a certain topic, some of these topics are not always appropiate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the @CAPS1 and look to find books that interest them, sometimes they cross book about stuff they should'nt know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups.     @CAPS3 you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing, you might have passes by many books about racism. As a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read. That kid just went from reading abot nascar to reading about racism and different races. I believe that book should be kept in order of age. @CAPS3 a teenager goes into the @CAPS1 to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on there topic. In most libraires there are topics such as sex, killing , and viloent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it.     If I am at the @CAPS1 I will always look for a book interest me. My skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was @NUM1 or @NUM2. Now that older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at the our hometown @CAPS1 and saw a @NUM3 year old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. @CAPS3 I saw this I was suprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections..     Kids visit the @CAPS1 all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too. Libraires would have trouble containg what kids read, so they should exposed all the differnt topics. @CAPS3 your little and your reading about these topics, you will then be more informed @CAPS3 your just little older.     Next time @CAPS3 you visit the @CAPS1 check and see what kids in your local towe are talking and reading about. You will be suprised @CAPS3 a child apporachs his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraies should exposed what they want @CAPS3 they want to ensure knowledge to everyone."

Children can learn alot from the books at the libraries. If you need help or answers about certain things you can always find what you are looking for in a library, they have all the answers. You can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book. As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school at the library.     It's so many things at the libraries that's educational, you just have to know what you are looking for. For some of these adults, if you was having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, do not mean the same for your child. Sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age. Parents please don't take away the good things out the libraries that could really help your child at times. If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start.     There are things that you would be better off finding in a book, because not everthing is on the enternet. So many sciencest found their information in a book, because its easier. You learn so many good things from a libraries. The books and things in a library help you with so much research. Taking materials out of a library I would have to disagree."

think its always good to have an anappropiate material on the shelves of stores or a library. i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy. Or maybe when you been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive be cause it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up.         My views on censorhip contain to keep the offensive materials because its what people like best. Music, magazines, books, and movies. All of these materials can entertain adults, and teenagers because of the anappropiate sayings. It seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act, such as music as the number one offensive material. Music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and starts to feel that anapprpiate vibe.          Another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch. Movies and television. when we watch a movie thats is offensive and that can be very anappropiate, you learn from whats in the movie. Most people make movies that can teach lessons if your willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life. Thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores. Television is basically the same for movies. You can learn a lot from a offensive @CAPS1 show, you can learn what and what not to do.          Also my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials of what we read, books; books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands. People seem to read books because of the catorgories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of peoples lifes, rough, lovely, funny and drama. We attend to read these offensive books because of what some of us been through as a kid or just would like to read it because they wanna maybe feel the same sympothy that some one else @MONTH1 have had. Also books can be adviceful of ehat people want to do in life, careers that you @MONTH1 be intersted in.     last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines. Magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf. I go against the reason of magazines to be on the shelf because its alot of gossip. I believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines. Also because of the false information. The false information that that give, is what we wanna buy. But for the most part of my oppinion, i believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up.     I believe the offensive materials music, movies, books, and some what of magazines should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy. They all catch eyes for gossip, provokinding adds"

In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so.     Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future.      Imagine the impact if the @CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the @CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place.     While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading '@ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music @MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they @MONTH1 speak a message. To a creationist @PERSON1's views @MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they @MONTH1 be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own.      We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another."

You should know what your picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off shevles of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyones opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for.     Censorship in libraries is just uneeded. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they dont pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child.      Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some it @MONTH1 be pictures. For others it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just can not be avoided. So why take it out of libraries.     If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book @MONTH1 contain material that @MONTH1 offend the reader of the book. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectingly pick up a book and be offended. But the people that @MONTH1 enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them.     Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what your picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that @MONTH1 enjoy reading them. Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries. It's not accomplishing anything."

Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case"

I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NO. THE REASONE WHY I STATE THIS BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE BOOKS THAT HELP YOU THROUGH OUT YOUR LIFE. THERE ARE RUDE AND HORABLE THINGS OUT IN THE WORLD. LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND SOME OF THOSE BOOKS WOULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR DESION MAKING. NOW THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY I THINK SO.          FIRST, HOW WOULD THE BOOK HELP OTHERS IN THE LONG RUN. I THINK IT WOULD BECAUSE SOME BOOKS TALK ABOUT THRE REAL DEAL. LIKE HOW TEENAGE GIRL BEING A  MOTHER AT A YOUNG AGE, OR HOW KIDS DONT FINISH SCHOOL AND NOW THEY ON THE STREET, IN JAIL, OR WORST. BOOKS MATERIALS LIKE THESE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE LIFE OTHER THAN YOU. SO THATS ONE REASON.     SECONDLY, THESE BOOKS IS LIKE A GUIDE TO OTHERS. THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE,  IF PEOPLE READ ABOUT VOILENCE AND STUFF THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY DONT WANT TO  GO THREW LIKE MYSELF FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS READING THIS BOOK CALL MY HOOD. AND THIS BOOK TALK ABOUT ALOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES LIKE GANG BANGING, SEX, DRUGS, HOOD FIGHTS ETC., THAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD.     THIRDLY, MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW OF DONT REALLY LIKE TO GET ADVISE OR TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PROMBLEMS. AND THEY CAN GET A BOOK OR SOMTHING THAT HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AS WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING THREW. THOSE BOOKS AND THINGS IS NOT VERY BAD THEY ACTUALLY HELP. AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE THEY REALLY NOT BAD THERE LIKE A LITTLE GUIDE TO MANY PEOPLE.     SO IN CONCLUSION DO I BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUCH AS BOOKS, MUSIC, MAGAZINE, ETC., SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF THEY ARE FOUND OFFENSIVE. ABOSULTLY NOT BECAUSE THOSE BOOK TALKS ABOUT REAL LIFE AND LIFE IS NOT ALWAYS FAIR"

that some materail should be remove if very offensive. I also believe that if its helping you learn then it should stay on the shelf. Everyone, has different thoughts about was is offensive or apropreate and whats not.  Also, everyone has different ideas or expectations on if books,music,movies,magazines, and so on are apropreate. Each person should read the cover of the book and so on to see if it will be apropreate for them.And the liabary should put warning stickers on  the book, so that person knows the graphic or voulgur language. Therefore, I beleive that the laibaries should put warning signs on anything to reduce less books being removed from the shelfs.   And so forth my decision is to not remove certain materail, only if offensive. The liabaries should use warning stickers on books so that person knows ahead of time about the graphic or voulgur language. I believe this will help and reduce the problems in our liabaries. Even thought alot of people will dis agree, this is what I believe should happen.  Heres why I believe this should happen. One day when I was younger just starting to read I came across a book. I was reading it to my mother then she takes the book away and gives it to the liabarean and told what happen. I guess I said a very inapropeate word and they had no idea the book had that kind of language in it. So, now everytime my mother takes my younger brothers to the liabary she makes sure the book they want are apropeate for there age group so the same incadent wont happen again.wouldnt you be the same way with your children?

Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, your going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. @TIME1 world is far from perfect. One reason i don't belive they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedon of speech and the press was not ment to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks their articles are innapropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are.     The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is becuase the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns. Kids can't be sheltered their whole lifes, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that. Kids these days are resiliant and can handle 'innapropriate' content. Parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in @TIME1 imperfect world of ours. It's just a natural part of growing up.     Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of @LOCATION1's libraries. When the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there. They are not guidlines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for @TIME1 great country. People to @TIME1 for freedom over much bigger issues than books. Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down. People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. I think it would be a crime against @LOCATION1 to censor things in libraries.     My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. If they think some of their articles are profound and innapropriate, meerly isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see. If people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections. Take responsibilty for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone @MONTH1 want that offending book.     These are all supporting opinions why I personally do not belive libraries should be censored. @TIME1 world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. Plus @TIME1 act would be completely unconstitutional. Finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them. If libraries were censored there would be a lot of missing information in @TIME1 world because there are many things in @TIME1 world that are 'offensive' to atleast someone"

I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion.     I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people, but sometimes can offence other people.  So, with this way I would really like if there was a scale, or organization of books.      So with that, people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like. If there is a scale factor of these books, music, magazines, or movies, you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories. Even though, I, personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization, it would atleast worn people of these things.     If you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed. I think that organizing the books in a different way would be better. This would be a lot of work but, thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself.     I would not like any books removed from libraries. This is because if you start taking one out of the library, that my offence someone, I believe you will start taking out more than one. With this thought I think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all. So please, please think about organizing the books, magazes, movies, music, and more so then this will not happen in the future. Thank you for your time to read this, I hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more. Also, maybe publish some too, into the newspaper."

The library is not just for the children but also for the adults. Children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. So why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? I think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. By pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library.     Another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. Their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. Most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. If everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. Their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being.     There are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair. I just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do."

Some believe that it is necessary others would disagree. My personal opinion would be that censorship is not necessary. Everyone is entitles to what they believe, and others have to have the maturity to accept that.     Censorship is not necessary because if you are offended by some material then don't read or listen to it. It is as simple as that. Everyone can be offended by something, so if everything was removed that was found to be offensive to someone there would be nothing left. If things were organized into sections that stated how offensive the material was then it is likely that almost everything would be in the offensive section.     Because censorship is contraversal there are many different thoughts on the subject. It ranges from no censorship to complete censorship, my view be just one of many. Censorship is truely just a matter of maturity and how a person goes about dealing with the material. The only person who can let you be offened is yourself, therefore censorship is not necessary in the library people just need to be mature about it."

looking for that sun   You're looking for that light   Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way      Black, you're looking for that sun   You're looking for that light   Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way      Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie      Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie..   Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie..   Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie   Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie   You're the big green monkey, everyone's a junkie      Black   You're looking for that sun   You're looking for that light   Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way      Black, you're looking for that sun   You're looking for that light   Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way   And I'll remember this someday      Black, you're looking for that sun   You're looking for that light   Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way      Black, you're looking for that sun   You're looking for that light   Lonely, you're not the only one to feel this way      Big green monkey, everyone's a junkie.Tell      Leave me out, get away   I gotta go a long way home   Can't see through the trees   Leave me out, get away   Better run fast as I can   From the man, the dirty man   Run away when he's knocking on the door      [Chorus: x2]      [Repeat: x2]   What's she runnin' from, I really don't know   Keep her runnin', it's a long way home   I hear the music, the songs we know   It's out of time and the beat's too slow.Candy talks to strangers   Thinks her life's in danger   No one gives a damn about her hair   It's lonely down on track street   She used to go by Jackie   The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers   Take a number where the blood just barely dried      Wait for something better   No one behind you   Watching your shadows   This feeling won't go      Crooked wheels keep turning   Children, are you learning   Acclimatize but don't you lose the plot   A history of blisters   Your brothers and your sisters   Somewhere in the pages we forgot      Take a number Jackie   Where the blood just barely dried   You know I'm on your side      Wait for something better   No one behind you   Watching your shadows   You gotta be stronger than the story   Don't let it blind you   Rivers of shadow   This feeling wont go      And the sky is full of dreams   But you don't know how to fly   I don't have a simple answer   But I know that I could answer   Something better      This feeling won't go      Wait for it [Repeat: x4].I do not think that anything is really offincive so i wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves. I do not easily get affended so i don't know what some things would be offincive but i guess that black poeple would be offincive of a rasist book?     I don't think that porn or anything involving nudety should be used in school library's because some parents are very stricked about that kind of stuff and that is very inapropriet for school. I think some parents take it over the top with whats inapropriet and what's not. Library's that are just public library's are totally diffrent and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal on what there about. If the people don't like it they don't need too look at it or get it.      So, i think that library's should have all diffrent kinds of books and movies. If the people don't like it then they can leave, and don't have too worry about it. That is what i have too say about that problem. I hope that this has changed or proswaded you alittle bit"

I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to. You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want.     The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing. If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings. That is no excuse.      The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it. Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around. Shows, movies,and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences. Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway. If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school. These days children learn about things sooner and sooner.        The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want. It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else. They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it.     That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed. It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want. A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy. This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it"

I read, watch, and listen to things everyday that my parents my not be too thrilled about, but it hasn't changed the person I am today. You can't escape things like drugs, sex, and other explicit things that we might not want our children reading about. It's in society. These things are everywhere, and just taking these materials off the shelves are not going to solve the problem. I think that we have a freedom to read about, listen, or watch whatever we would like, and removing these things takes away our freedom. I think that inappropriate books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should not be taken off the shelves.      '@CAPS1' items are all over society. It's everywhere you look. Billboards, signs, books, magazine, music, television, movies, etc., but taking things like books, movies, music, and magazines off the shelves are not going to stop the inappropriate behavoir. Everyone in society is still going to act this way, whether you can stop your children from hearing about it or not. You still have commercials, billboards, etc. What are you going to do? Ban your children from life in general? No, I don't think so.      Reading, listening, learning, about this stuff isn't going to make your child a horrible person. I personally think, at a certain age, they need to know about this stuff. For example, I'm a good student, I behave well outside of school, I have good friends, and I get along with my family. I also read every single one of @PERSON1 books. All of them are about people who do drugs, are suicidal, and do sexual related things. These books are extremely good. Definitely the best books I've ever read, but reading these books hasn't changed who I am. I don't do drugs, I'm not into sexual things, so why would it hurt if I read books about it?      From my experience, reading these things are honestly kind of helpful. It takes you deeper into things. Everyone knows the basic learning you get in school, which is extremely @CAPS2. Reading these books, and listening to this kind of music, and watching these kinds of movies, takes a whole different point of view. Back to my experience with the @PERSON1 books, you read stories that are based off of her life and relationship with her daughter. Crank, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 is a trilogy of books that show the life of @LOCATION1. You see the struggle, the hurt, and the pain the family goes through as @PERSON2 starts to walk with the monster, also known as @CAPS5. Reading these books makes me realize that I don't want to ever put myself through the things @PERSON2 does to herself, and her family. It gives a whole new look on things. After reading these, I believe I won't ever do 'offensive' things.      From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary. It gives a deeper look into information about these things. Also, you can't escape explicit material. These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from. You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material. At least not forever"

pastures of dream day   Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me   Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning   Come see me take my hand   Come see me in my land   Flying invisibly high, watch me   All on a beautiful sky, I'll be   Clear and serene in the love I've discovered   Long search is over, the soul is uncovered   Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing   Bidding farewell to the fears now decreased   Come see me take my hand   Come see me in my land   High on a golden crested wave she sits   The little nymphs dance in her hair   The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives   Horizons come to sip wine there   The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef   The albatross flies to the stern   And only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return   Crossing the mountains of truth see them   Soaring majestically high, and then   Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly   Thunder awakes me, it crashes beside me   Shatter the scene and

has begun   Let us stand together   And remember, men fight great, but women are greater fighters)      Huh!.So I would know the reason why....In libraries, is censorship truly needed? I believe there should be some censorship to some extent.     Libraries are usually pretty good at sorting things. I mean, they do use the @ORGANIZATION1 in every library I've been in. But even when they do sort the books, music, and magazines by topic, there's always something offensive that can fit in that topic as well.     I remember as a child of seven or eight going to the library all the time with my mother. I realized I was getting too old for the 'kiddy book section,' so I ventured forth to places I've never been before. Any isle of books was open to anyone, I felt that I had the world in the palm of my hand.      Most of the books were too mature of a read for me anyways, butt I still looked through them all. I mean, it was something very new to me; almost like an adventure. Then, I came across the music.     There were so many inappropriate titles, cover-arts, and even names of bands. But this perked my curiosity. I remember thinking to myself, 'were books this way too?' I soon found out yes, they were. There were even doctor books with graphic images. The worst were books with cuss words that I found. Innocence in the library was gone.     I think libraries should have a different section for older, more mature people; not including children. Some people loves books, and will open any book just to read or look at the pictures. Libraries need to realize that. I was once that little kid who opened the wrong book, at the wrong time.    In conclusion, I think libraries should have at least some censorship. I understand that people enjoy the books and music that once terrored me, but I think there should be something done about it"

I remember when I was younger and  I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library , I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people. I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish.      Another time something like this occured was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magizine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions. The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half , talk about having issues , anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well.      There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things , one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it.      But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door , it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote , ' @CAPS1 speak louder than words '"

views on cencorship @MONTH1 not  be what others believe. With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call innapropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelfs is easier. Although many people @MONTH1 think that a certain book is appropriate, others @MONTH1 disagree. That's why creating a rating system would be best.     With a rating system of books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch. If there is vulgar language inside of the book, it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is. That way, if there are complaints of the item, the library would not be blamed.      I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others' complaints should occur. I believe that the books could be kept, but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they @MONTH1 be more innapropriate than the normal. What happens when a college student needs a book that is mandatory for his class and the book is banned because of 'innapropriate usage'? There is no way of making everyone completely satisfied, but with this system a lot of issues would be resolved.     My views on cencorship @MONTH1 not be what others believe, but taking away perfectly written books is not right. Disagreement isn't the easiest thing, but just because it's hard doesn't mean you have to give up. The rating system would decrease the complications and help others to be more free with their decisions"

What one might find appauling, others @MONTH1 find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests.          Books such as The @CAPS1, The @CAPS2's @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been removed from many library shelves. Though people @MONTH1 check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education.      Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them.               The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that @MONTH1 be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them.      Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom."

Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries.They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons.     One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books.     Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs. Also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will. People arn't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some arn't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person.     Another reason books shouldnt be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You @MONTH1 get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime.Find another way to solve that problem.     There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completly remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive. Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it @MONTH1 offend them. Thats why removing books from shelves arn't cause for."

In many libraries, some books are not censored and catagorized the way they should. In some of the reading material, one might not even realize that some inappropriate things are in it. Supervision of children and young adults are not always looked upon, and some of these people might not even know what they are checking out. Censorship needs to be pushed more in libraries.      In most libraries, the catagories for books are children, young adult, adult books by genere, magazines, and music, but what needs looked upon is what is on the inside covers of those books. Some magazine articles are not appropriate for some teens, even if it does claim to be age appropriate. I remember when I was fourteen, I read a series that was related to colors off the color weel. Each one covered a different topic such as suicide, alcholism, drugs, sex, same sex dating, and jealousy. Looking back on it, I am surprised I was allowed to check them out at the library. A fourteen year old didn't need to read books on such heavy topics.Also, language in books and music maybe unappropriate for children, and @MONTH1 be distasteful and disrespectful for some adults. The catagories need to be catogorized even more, so people further know what they are getting into when checking out a book or magazine.      When a child goes up to check out a book they found, a librarian sometimes doesn't even pay attention to the book they are getting, they simply check it out. Libraries should have a rating system like movies do. Generally people would not let their ten-year-old go to a movie rated @NUM1, @CAPS2 or that is unrated, so @CAPS1 would they let their child get a book holding the same content? If books had a rating system, that ten-year- old would not get their hands on a book rated '@CAPS2' or '@CAPS4' for mature.     In libraries there is not as much supervision as their needs to be. I am aware that libraries are not day-care center and the librarians are not babysitters, but there also needs to be stricter guidelines, because some people are not fully aware of what their children or what they, themselves, are reading. For example, a thirteen-year-old girl wants to check out @CAPS5 magazine, because her best friend's older sister gets it. The girl's mother allows it because it probably won't be too bad and she assumes her daughter wants to look at the pictures of new clothes and trends. What the mother @MONTH1 not realize is in the middle of the magazine contains an article about sex and protection, and that @MONTH1 open a whole new world for the little girl. Even though the mother shouldn't have had let her daughter check out the magazine, if the guidelines were stricter at the library the girl might have never have read that article. Even if librarians had to check or scan a person's library card to make sure they can be in the section or be reading a certain book, it would be protecting many more people then it would be hurting.     If libraries censored books better, then children and teens @MONTH1 not be reading things not age appropriate to them. I'@CAPS4 not saying that books should be removed off the shelf, just maybe put up higher, and be watched over more carefully"

Premonition....There is, however, a class of fancies of exquisite delicacy which are not   Thoughts, and to which as yet I have found it absolutely impossible to   Adapt to language..No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive.  I think that if a parent sees something that they do not want their child reading, then it is in their right to not allow that child read it, but it is unfair to take it off the shelf entirely.  That book that has been marked 'offensive' could have been a way for another person to learn about that book and possibly gain something out of it.  There are some non-fiction books out there that can marked as 'offensive', and they are just that non-fiction.  It is something that really happen and anyone can learn something from it by reading it, and to take it away would be taking away the knowledge that another person could have obtained.      I believe that in a library people should have a choice to read what they choose and not have it ripped off the shelf just because parents don't want their child reading it.  I think that if they do not want their child to read it, then the parents can tell that child that they don't want them reading that and then everybody wins.  I know that I have read some non-fiction books that would be marked by some people as offensive, but with that book I also learned much about the topic at hand.  To take away that book would be showing that you care only about how it might be offensive to some people and not how it could help extend the knowledge of another.  If we are to take away every book that might have a racial slur here or an act of violence there, what would we have left our children to read and to learn from.  They read these books and they can find out how that racial slur or act of violence as hurt someone emotionaly and physicaly, and that they should never do it in fear of the concicence that they might have to face later on.       Overall, I think that the books and other material in libraries should be kept on the shelves, and if someone finds it offensive or anything else they shouldn't read it and not deprive someone of that knowledge.  We live in a world today where education is everything, and we think that everyone should have an education.  But if we take away every book that a person does not like then what do we have left to learn from."

 and people were behaving' like they ought to: good   There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy   and this is what he said   ""Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash   robbing' old folks and making' the dash""   They did the job, money came with ease   but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease   He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother   Tried to rob a man who was a D.T..Author Katherine Paterson proclaims, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work i abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' A controversial issue in today's society are people's conflicting views on censorship in libraries. Many types of books, magazines, music, movies, and much more have been banned from being put on the shelves of libraries because of their content. From personal experience, observations, and reading of the issue censorship should not be allowed in libraries.     The shelves of libraries will soon be empty if censorship continues. Certain readings, and types of entertainment have already begun to disappear one by one. It is understandable if one person does not agree with the material being placed into these books, but why should they ruin the entertainment for everyone else? From my own experience, people in my elementary school were not able to enjoy reading a popular series of books at that time period. Since I went to a @CAPS1 school, the priest at the corresponding church during that time decided he did not agree with the content in this certain series of books. As a result, he took charge and made the staff of the school remove those books from our school library, and no student was allowed to come to school with one of those types of books. If it had been up to him, he would have decided to go ahead and take out all those books from everywhere in the world. Just because one individual does not agree on the content of that book, they should not be able to have the power to banish the lovely leisure for the rest of the population.     Authors and artists of books, movies, and music have the freedom to put into them whatever they choose. It should not be up to their audience to decide whether or not it is appropriate. The concept is quite simple; if the reader or viewer does not think they would agree with the work, then they should not spend their time to read or view the pieces at hand. Just because they might not completely think what the content entails is necessarily appropriate, someone else might enjoy it. Censorship is wrong for this very reason. The creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to. The audience they are trying to appeal to @MONTH1 not have the same taste in style as someone who the work was not necessarily meant to have their own opinion on the matter. Books should not be able to be taken out of libraries because what one person might think is not appropriate to be placed into public, another person @MONTH1 enjoy thouroughly. Likewise, if the content of a work of literature does not appeal to an individual then it should just simply not be read by that person. As humans, there is the freedom of choice as to what people would like to read, and what they would not like to indulge in. So make the correct choice in deciding what you want to read, and do not ruin the enjoyment for many others.     In a great deal of different types of literature censorship is touched on by the authors. For example, in the popular prize-winning novel, @CAPS2 @NUM1, books are burned, or 'censored' because they contain information people should not be aware of in that period of time. However, in today's world books are a major type of entertainment and are important in the knowledge of everyone. Books provide so much information on almost every subject known to human-kind that it would be such a dramatic loss if now books were burned if caught reading one. Paterson does point out that everyone has a right to their own opinion of this matter, but if people do not take the right approach to solving this situation, there will be no books left on library shelves for several generations after to enjoy for themselves. Every individual has their own right to be able to read books and absorb all the wonders and knowledge they contain.     As a result of the growing awareness of censorship in today's libraries, people @MONTH1 never be able to enjoy certain types of books, movies, music, and magazines. From my own past experiences on this situation I know how wrong it is to take away someone's own privelage to enjoy types of literature. People should not have a say whether something is appropriate or not to be taken out of libraries. If the individual does not simply agree with the specific content of the work then they need to accept it and move on instead of causing millions of others to not enjoy it. Also, from different types of reading, censorship has definitely become a serious issue, but it should be abolished. Keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves"

These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf.     One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'.  This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people.    A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4.  This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'.  Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart.  But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real.       But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs.  The book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs.     So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive.  Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1'!"

Where you go to make money,   And now our fortune's made,   And now you're there,   Little house in old Louisiana..In my opinion,  I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited.      When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic.          Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well.      Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases.      Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that @MONTH1 not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, @MONTH1 be seen as a good thing to another."

and the friends,   And we played the parts 'til the words came to an end..In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, @MONTH1 offend other.      In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non fiction..(etc). So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people.      We are blessed to live in @LOCATION1, where we have freedom of speech. So authors have freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people? I do not think that is right.     '@CAPS1 man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book @MONTH1 not mean something to one person but it @MONTH1 mean the word to someone else.      You never know what people @MONTH1 need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book @MONTH1 offend a few people, but it @MONTH1 save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life.      Take @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for intance, her journal is now a book. Now this @MONTH1 offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like @CAPS4 @CAPS5, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your @NUM1 year old to hear about how they use to treat @CAPS4 @CAPS7 women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told.      I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offened a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book"

In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1.     Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.      I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.     I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television. Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.     If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom."

Some people @MONTH1 believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others @MONTH1 disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away.     If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy.    For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed.     I am also aware that people @MONTH1 just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's @MONTH1 require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game.      We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them"

But i also think people should beable to read what they want to read. many people wouldnt read a book that they think would affend them.      There are many kinds of books not all book will be bad or affend people. but books that are not apropriot for young kids or teens shouldnt even be in school librarys. In public librarys i think it should be ok to have every type of book. and have different books in different place's. like haveing the young adalt section and the adalt and children section.     I think screton books should be sold in book stores like i dont think they should have inapropeiout books in children book store's. They should have a different store for certain books. And parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying.      There are lots of parents that dont really care about what there kids read, and to me that's there busness but my apenioun is that they shouldn't let there kids read what they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, i think they would be old enough to choise what they want to read. by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easer"

wondered   If it smarts when you've hurt and ignored   Oh, the sort that goes away   Even though I waited for you   Oh, how I adore you      You never saw my face   I traced your path each day   We could be always together      Now I watch you bleed   You had all I need   How I love you so   Now we'll never know   If I can't have you      I even did the research   Went to work, learned to flirt   Wore a skirt and faced dirt   And, ah, still you didn't notice   You never focused on me      You never saw my face   I traced your path each day   You never lifted your eyes to me, ah      Now I watch you bleed   You had all I need   How I love you so   Now we'll never know   If I can't have you      If I can't have you   If I can't have you   If I can't have you.The countess krupp   Crossed

pressure on me to make more weapons..Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve?                                            What if @NUM1 people came into a library with  @NUM2 books, magazines, music and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like.                                                                 If someone did not like your house and said I don't want to see it should they have to demolish it just like nothing?                The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse.              I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it. One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have  separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges.                                       If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy."

your heart has been broken   Is it love?.Do i think that if books, movies, music, magazines, etc should be removed from the shelves just becuase they are offensive? No, i don't think that the stuff should be removed from the shelves just becuase someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say this ok if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelve because i think it's offensive or this or that then we wouldn't have anything to wacht, lissin to, or even read. I under stand that yes people do have rights and there believes on something but it doesn't mean that they have any say so on what should stay or what should go.           If we let people do this than nobody would be abel to wacht, read, play,  or even lissin to for fun. Us people used these thing for haveing something to keep us intertaned. Let's say this ok we all know how littel children have thier emanginashon and they used that to keep them intertaned just like us older people used books, music, movies, and ect to keep us intertand. Well if we don't have this stuff than we would be lost and won't know what to do with out that stuff. Just's think of our littel kids if we take there emanginashon away than they would be lost and hoples because that's how they learn and grow up.     We people used this every day use to not onley keep us intertaned but to also help us learn more about what every we need to learn about to survive in every day life. See in ways we are not so diffrent from our chiledren at all realy. they used what every they find or see to keep them intertaned and for enjoiment. If people realy thought about what they are realy going to do by removing something from the shelves than they would regreat that what they did was stupied because now they don't have anything to read, lissin to, or even wacht. I my own self had experience on what it's like to have something like that polled down from the shelves befor and it's realy not cool at all fore that to happen. Takeing something off the shelfs that is alittel bit offensive doesn't meen that it should be tooken off the shelves.     I think that if people who took something off the shelves just becase one person thought that it was offensive if wrong and should not take somthing down that maby other people like. I mean just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not and maybe it's something that people could learn from. Taking something down befor even reading it your self is stupied on be hafe of your part becasue maby other people like and maby you like it who knows. I just think that people should realy think befor they go and take something off the shelves with out haveing alote of people giveing you a bad coment on it befor just taking one persons opean on it."

Who can truely say a book, movie, music, or magazine is truely offensive. There are some of the obvious movies that completely make fun of or taunt someone's personal views as a religion or lifestyle but is a book about a wizarding world really that offensive?     While growing up I had a friend who was very religious. Her parents would never let her read the @ORGANIZATION1 books by @PERSON1. At the time I didn't understand why she wasn't able to read such fantastic books. Now that I'm older I understand that her parents believe what is in 'The @CAPS2' and nothing more. Make believe and imagination was @CAPS1 a suitable thing fpr their child to read. For many families, though the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series is nothing but a different world in which they can set themselves free from the real world. Should a book that many people love and adore be taken off shelves because some families are offended? I personally don't think they should.      While my family loves the books and movies some families don't. That is their lifestyle and their opinion. Everyone has an opinion, and if we took out everything in this world that could offend someone we would be left with nothing. Movies would be boring, stories would @CAPS1 be interesting, and there would be no music.      If our world was based off of the opinions of others and making everyone happy we would @CAPS1 have music. Music is a way for someone to release their soul. The different sounds of music are based off generations. My mother's generation was based on @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 and mine is of @CAPS6, @CAPS7&@CAPS8, @CAPS9. So what would really happen if all the offensive materials were taken off the shelves of a public library or say a @ORGANIZATION2. The shelves would be blank. Empty shelves would be a horrible look.      Everyone is offended by something. I'm offended by the rape scences in movies but some people believe in some situations it makes a movie better. My friend's family is offended by the make believe world of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and I believe that some where out in our world there is another world, a wizarding world as a matter of fact.      People believe in many different things and like many different things. I've never met one person who is exactly like me, because there is @CAPS1 one. I'm an individual like everyone else and if the things I liked were taken off a shelf because someone was offended then my life would be boring because I wouldn't have the things I enjoy. In some cases some offensive things should be taken off shelves but who am I to say it should be, because there is someone out there who believes it should be on the shelves of @LOCATION1"

The libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should sperate their books only as they do already.     Some material does seem to advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic gwroth. Some people should think that school should not read @PERSON1 due to racism in the south. This was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. If there were those soprt of restrictions then schools would lack much of histories best literature.     Just as the movies do for the gerneal population, @CAPS1 is for @NUM1 and up while @NUM2 is for @NUM3 and up. These are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. This concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem.Yet this is already done in libraries. There would be no reason to break these sectiopns up more then they already are broken. There is the young adult section, adult, and youth. Those are the main catagories that most perople want sperate due to offensivce material such as drugs, sex, and alchohol.     Much of the media that is public today is censered and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the outh can stunt them academically"
"Shit, no one can fuck with me in this tin can!.If I could only do it all again...      And the sky is filled with light   Can you see it?.What it is?.Let me say once more that I need you,   One more time or just maybe two..Do you wish to be a man?.Outside day starts to dawn      Your

you   I'm just the broken hearted kind   Worrying blues in my mind   Worrying blues in my mind.A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled..Early morning day is dawning   Cooling towers and factory gates   Dirty streets and laughing people   Skinny dogs and beer crates      Hello my old friend   Hello my old friend      Sad canals green black water   Somewhere bicycles and beds   Wet

Here I could stand for hours and hours      (Young girls sing Fara Jacka in the background)   Big machines that once were champions   Turn to dust under the sky   Broken windows choking chimneys   Factory walls for miles and miles      Bye bye my old friend   Bye bye my old friend      Just to see the sunset   Pretty rainbows over your majestic towers   To feel your earth beneath my feet   Here I could stand for hours and hours.I love it though   I love it though      Uh put your hands to the constellations   They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation   I know I'm preaching to the congregation   We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan      I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting   We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation      May the Lord forgive us   May the God's be with us   And that magic hour   I seen good Christians   Make brash decisions   Oh she do it,   What happened to Religion?.Na, na, na, na, na   Na, na, na, na, na      Ain't got a damn [?].I went and sold my soul so I could pay my rent   I waited by the mail, but the check was never sent   So I called the Devil up, but I just got his machine   I left an angry message, said ""I gotta have the green""   I didn't give up then, but I made another plan   If Satan didn't want my soul I'd sell it to the man   I tried to find the number, but it wasn't in the book   I'd get the money anyhow, no matter what it took   No matter what it took      No paragon of virtue, at least I'm not a thief   It's so easily justified but always leads to grief   So I got a piece of cardboard and made myself a sign   To sell my soul below the market rate was my design   I went down on the street and I tried to make the deal   A Land Rover drove right by with Satan at the wheel   He saw what I was doing and said   ""That's not yours to sell!.It is time to face facts and not mince a word..She's got a world of talent, knows just what to do,   The little girl from Central, a tweedle dee dee doo..oh, galvanized in the world wide show   As we fertilize the seed..Oh the smartest packet you can find,   Ah he, ah ho, are you most done?.Some people think that offensive books should be off the selves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed.     I do not believe that certain materials (books, movies, and magazines.  If we take evey book off the self then we would not have any book to read.  If we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking @NUM1 books off the self.  Then with in two days there would be not books left.     If we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad. We should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read.  If people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books.     This is why people should not take offensice books off the selves. This will make peoples eyes so bad that they would not see good at all."

And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on   See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny   I fall back and all a man do is laugh   I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft   Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math   But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on   So I had to come through and take the corner back   And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack

I look away   Then you show me, I'm not really on my own      Chorus:   I can't always see you   But I know you are there   In the quiet ways you talk to me   I can tell you're near   You love me even when I'm not aware   I can't always see you, but I know you are there      So many times I know you're speaking   And although I may not hear   All the things you have to say   In my heart you make it clear   That you'll never leave me even though I turn away   And you show me, I don't have to be afraid      Chorus      And I remember how your love was so real   And how you changed my life completely      Chorus (2x)      I can't always see you, but I know you are there.Imagine your child or someone that is very close to you. He's only around @NUM1 old just starting to learn how to be an adult and take on responibliltys. He wants to try new things. He listeans to his friends talking about drinking alchol and how much fun is it. He thinks it sounds amazing to drink. He dosnt no something is bad about it or not. No one every told him. So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing. Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you. If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life. Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are. There should not be censorship in libraries. Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.' @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people.     How do you tell on someones maturity level? There are many ways to tell. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature. But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature. Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing. Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way. Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.     Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.. @MONTH1 have inapropte things in them. Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles? @CAPS1 a hard question to answer. But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes. If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies. People could assume that drugs kill you. But, what about the other thing? Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio. But, when they here that word or read about something or watch. They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive.      Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..? It depends on the person. But, you can educate someone about the subject matter. No matter how offensive the topic is. We should teach people about them. If we dont, its bound to repeat it self. Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was. No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust. Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea.      Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects. Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects. We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level. These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places"
"I'm in love with a dying man..Where is she?.There stood he, on his chariot made of gold   He did reveal the trinity of secrets old..Life, I love you, All is groovy..First chorus   Intro: [d] ...[a7] ...[d] ... [d7]   Yea!.A spark soaring down through the pouring rain   And restoring life to the lighthouse   A slow motion wave on the ocean stirs   My emotion up like a rain cloud      When did the sky turn black?.Is it you girl I'm thinking of?.The witch keeps sellin' me!.Lord, You're leading me   With a cloud by day   And then in the night   The glow of a burning flame      And everywhere I go I see you   Everywhere I go I see you      And You take my hand   And You wash it clean   I know the promised land   Is light years ahead of me      And everywhere I go I see you   Everywhere I go I see you      And the eagle flies   And the rivers run   I look through the night   I can see the risin' sun      And everywhere I go I see you   Everywhere I go I see you      Well, the grass will die   And the flowers fall   But Your Word's alive   Will be after all      And everywhere I go I see you   Everywhere I go I see you.Outside the window, on the ground   Our hound dog was growling   Grey Riders flew across my lawn   I looked again   And they all were gone..Christopher discovered you're way ahead of your time..Those summer nights seem long ago   And so is the girl you use to call   The queen of New York City      But if you send for me, you know I'll come   And if you call for me, you know I'll run   I'll run to you, I'll run to you   I'll run, run, run   I'll come to you, I'll come to you   I'll come, come, come      The power of youth is on my mind   Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time   Will you still love me when I shine   From words but not from beauty   My father's love was always strong   My mother's glamour lives on and on   Yet still inside, I felt alone   For reasons unknown to me      But if you send for me, you know I'll come   And if you call for me, you know I'll run   I'll run to you, I'll run to you   I'll run, run, run   I'll come to you, I'll come to you   I'll come, come, come      And if you call I'll run, run, run   If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come      Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine   Cashmere, cologne and hot sunshine   Red racing cars, sunset and vine   And we were young and pretty.Here we are in a warm embrace   As cozy as a kitten by a fireplace   The lights are dim with a mellow glow   The musics playin' soft 'n low..Please don't laugh at me   When I tell you   I believe in love,   'cause it's still   The only thing that   There is too little of..You either have it   or you've had it!.Hmmm, I guess but baby you should know oh, oh, oh, oh      I'm an optimist   I'm so positive   That you'll never get another chance with me baby   I'm an optimist   I'm so positive   That your chances blown, boy you're gone, spread your negativity..Promise I will be by your side (who would've thought baby)   I'll be everything you need to get by (missing you baby)   What I broke you know we finally mend (I need you baby)   Baby if we got together again (why me?).we'll run shit basic   Everything kitty, cocaine crazy   Bitch they hit my phone, they fucked out my situation..Love possesses nothing   Nor would it ever be possessed   Love is love sufficient unto love   And you can figure out the rest      God rests in reason   So what should you do, oh, oh   When god moves through you?.(Hug self as if snug and warm.).I'm too old to change, but what of my sons,   How will they know that we weren't the ones?.Grandma take me home!.Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left. So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library?     When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My @CAPS1 did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and @CAPS1 was okay with that and things like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', and '@PERSON1'.      Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; @CAPS1 likes country, @CAPS7 likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my unlcle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it.      That just does to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others. If we relied on peoples' opinions to keep our librarys free of offense, there would be nothing in it"

books it has on the shelvs? I think it should be. There are many offensive books and thangs on the shelvs. I wouldnt want my kid or anybody els kid reading offensive books. So lets get rid of all the bad stuff or atleast filtyer it all.     I beleve any book, movie and magazines that have alot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be cheked out to a certion age. If they wana keep teh books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permsion slip to get the books. Removing teh  books and thangs complitly @MONTH1 cause to much troubl so we should defntly make sure the kid is a certian age and has permsion.     I would not want my @NUM1 year old kid read a book with bad language in it. Kids cach on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing. There is alot going on in socaty now a days that badly influnce children. They do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals. I think thats why we have so much of a probly to day becouse evry one sees it at a young age and they want to be lyk that wehn tehy get older but that is a very bad thing. They do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good. If we do not filter wat they do at a young age they will end up being hellins and outa of countral becouse they will think just becouse someone in a book or movie did it that its ok for them to do it but its not.     I would not wnat a young kid to read bad things. I say lets put a ge limit on them and mack our socity beeter and are kids to become beter adoults later on in ther life. We need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids. If we don't who knows how theyl grow up to be the world could go to hell if we dont stop the kids from learning bad things. So lets get the fi,ltering satrted and save the world and our kids future."

It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certin cases when it's needed though.     It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids. they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them.     The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it.     Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not rignt. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be down right mean some times. The whole world is just corupted.     There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature. People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read. The library shouldn't censor their books."

The main reasons that i belive censorship in libraries are fine are that almost everything in the library are for people to learn about weather they read it or watch a movie about it. Another reason is that if they took everything that was offecsive or unliked then there would be a lot less information for people to learn about in libraries.     I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive then there would be no books left. Every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone. For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away? Libraries are a place that someone can go to, to learn about something. They hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive then they should just leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it. There are things in life that people need to be opened to or informed about even though they @MONTH1 not always be plesent. Libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information.     To sum it all up, yes there are things in libraries that some people @MONTH1 find offensive but other people @MONTH1 learn from it and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else. A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should alway have information on different subjects and topics. Many people have learned things from a library that have affected their lives and will keep learning more things as long as they are still opened to a wide source of information."

In @DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive.      Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model.     Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies.      Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life.      Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used.      In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have."

unbelievable   In the mystic air   Was it just not in your cause   It seems so unfair!.No, cause if that is the case evry  book you read could be offense to somebody. If they think the book is bad then don't read it.First off a book should not be banned from a libary.It is just a book.Second the only reason they would want to band a book is because people like to start drama. Third reason every could be offense to somebody.          First off they should not band a book just because people don't like it.If your child read an adult book that is good for them, for reading those big words.And if they just happen to see a naked picture it is not the end of the world. I bet it is not the first and it won't be the last.     Second some people would try to band a book just to start drama. They know it will cause a lot of crazy things with the author.     Finaly If they band books for being offense then they would not have a libary. Cause any body says something is offense.In all they should not band one book."

I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this. I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read. A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space. We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials.     I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people. There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against. If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone. Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think.     If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view. If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like.     Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine. There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and @MONTH1 find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining. Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are. These arent ways to judge a book.     I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations. Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us. There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people."

No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.      First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different intrests than others. Some people @MONTH1 like certain kinds of books and movies while others @MONTH1 not. For instance, one of my favorite types of movies to watch is a comedy. On the other hand, there are many friends of mine that love to watch horror movies. This is something you can not change. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem.      I believe that we can solve this problem by just seperating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are seperated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completly from a library.      All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being to offensive"

Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imaginiation, taken in whatever direction they so choose for @CAPS1 be to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less then lonesome trash floating the winding streets if @CAPS1 were censored.       @CAPS1 is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way to scary for them, plus @CAPS1 shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch @CAPS1. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about @CAPS1 of course.      The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see @PERSON1: @CAPS1 in my childrens section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them"

Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.     First, people have different views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely.      Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone.      Finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it. Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it.      Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. Taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more. Not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them"

It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting.  The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.  If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public"

That I never gave..Hey!.No one ever told me when I was alone   They just thought I'd know better, better..Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book. @CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another"

in the '60s   So unsure of my direction   I would follow where my friends and family would lead   I was strengthened   When I first heard the music   Sparked by inspiration   I was scarred by the pain   Of constant departures   I was wounded severely   At an early age   But my hopes hung high   On the thought of the future   I was happy to watch      The time go by   Eye to eye   Watching the time go by   Watching the time go by   Day for night   Watching the time go by      And then the world changed   There was hope in the distance   Til it raced up around us   And proceeded to shine   Like the moonlight   Full of reckless abandon   We would reach for the stars   'Cause there was room at the top   And food on the table   We were doing quite well   At such an early stage   There was no need to stop   Nor were we able   And no one could see      The time go by   Eye to eye   Watching the time go by   Watching the time go by   Day for night   Watching the time go by      There are moments I regret more than the rest   There are days I can't recall at all   Looking back now, there's not much that I would change   I am happy to watch      The time go by   Eye to eye   Watching the time go by   Watching the time go by   Eye to eye   Watching the time go by      Watching the time go by   Day for night   Watching the time go by   Watching the time go by   Why, oh why   Watching the time go by.I hear the rumors flyin'   About a head on crash   At the stroke of midnight   When centuries clash   Some gonna party   Some gonna kneel and pray      Well you can quote the bible   Bribe the devil   But there's gonna be some hell to pay      We were young and innocent   Thought this day would never come   And tomorrow seems a million miles away      Let's look each other in the eyes   And realize it could be time   To set aside our anger   And know we're all the same      Take my hand   We gonna cross the line   To a brand new day on the end of time   We're gonna rise as one and fall together   Out here on the ledge   Standin' on the edge, of forever      From the silence I hear the thunder roll   Words of the prophets echo in my soul   One salvation in this world to me   I know in my heart if we love each other   We can face what's meant to be      We were young and innocent   Thought this day would never come   And tomorrow seems a million miles away      Now there's power in the wrong hands   A madman in a foreign land   If we don't get our senses   It's all gonna slip away      Take my hand   We gonna cross the line   To a brand new day on the end of time   We're gonna rise as one and fall together   Out here on the ledge   Standin' on the edge, of forever      Take my hand   We're gonna cross the line   To a brand new day on the end of time   We're gonna rise as one and fall together   Out here on the ledge   Standin' on the edge   Out here on the ledge   Dancin' on the edge, forever   Oh, oh forever, oh forever.I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed."

different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow.     At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose.     My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it.     Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives.     If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains."

In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people. Because not all people have the same interests.     First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves.     Another example can be a book. what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended. They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend.     The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertizement. A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person.     In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. they shouldn've look at the item in first place."

People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter. I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books. I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want. Second, the libraries should be able to put what ever they want on the shelfs. Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book.      Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that. Everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad. There is all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them then other genres. Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you.     Libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like. There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music. Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it. the stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are.     People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out. You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases. People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or @CAPS1. The libraires and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are. That can tell you where the uncensored parts are. You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive.      The libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies. Its your choice what to get not theirs. People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive. Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others."

People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff.      Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive.     For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life. In history @CAPS2 because he killed people. Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self. which is a saying I have heard many of times.          So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, edgucate, and entertain themselves by. Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people"

However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes.  @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.  We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.     If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.  If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.  Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.  Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.  After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.    Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.  We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.  We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.  People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.     Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.  Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson.  Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.  If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out.  Then, many words would be gone.     Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.  However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.  I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.  People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.  We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.  If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.  However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.                                                            Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2"

Rather than you, she said   I prefer solitude   Rather the company   I prefer cigarrettes   Even Los Angeles   Suffers occasionally   Do you have somewhere to stay?.Hot, fire, hot      [Chorus]   L!.Books That Are Offensive     @CAPS1 view point is that books should not be taken off the shelfs if taken offensive to one person. Sometimes people get help from books that are offensive to others because somebody is doing something wrong and the book @MONTH1 help the other person. Everybody should be able to read a book if they want in a library. In a library everybody should have the right to read every book.     The idea of taking a book off the shelf is a bad because people want to read books like that. Some people have a problem with that type of book but if they don't like it then tell people not to read it not take it off the shelf. If anything put it in a different area or just move it put all that type of book in one area not mixed in.     When people need help they read a book or look it up. So if the book is offensive but can help somebody with problems then don't even move it. People do have a reason to read books that are offensive. We don't know all of the reasons but there are alot of them.     If a movie is not good for children or just very horid it @MONTH1 need to be put in a place where nobody will look. Kids and grown ups are the same and nobody needs to see a movie if it is really bad.       Usually when somebody takes something offensive they are guilty of something and know they are but will not admit it. People think other people write things that are just offensive on purpose ,but they don't they write it and somebody is guilty if something and can not live up to it. Sometimes just the reading is read wrong and misunderstood.     Everybody has had a book that they thought was offensive but then the next person read it and they might think it is funny. The biggest problem is some people can't read. then some people read so fast they do not comprehend it correctly.     I don't feel like them certain materials should be taken off the shelf if found offensive because that person @MONTH1 be feeling guilty of something. If the materials should be moved they should just be moved to a different area not off of the shelves totally. If it is taken offensive they should tell the librarian and then if very many more people say it is offensive then it can be taken off the shelf."

@MONTH1 concern,      Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover.      In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the selves of the world or nation's libraries. @CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries      Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientel. When a major divistion such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. @CAPS1 would ruin the economy. Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to.      People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intellegent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuede others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences.      Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. @CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated"

Beautiful no strange cause....I don't know!.Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well.     Books are essential part of life. They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books.     It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1.     Over all, books are a good thing. They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them."

dysentery..No, no, no   No it just can't be      And why can't anyone ever tell me, now ?.Take the best..Libraries in @LOCATION1     I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book. I dont think that just because it is offensive someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject.          I think if someone dose'nt like whats in the book they should just not read it or something, because some people might find it interesting. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. Thats why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. Thats what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf.     So whoever is reading this please take this in consideriation and relize that some people like different books than others.

Censorship in Libraries     I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library"

"".Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose.  This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's.  Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books peole read.     Censorship of books is competely unneccessary.  If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to.  Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice; nobody forced them to read it.  Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book.  Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose.     Finding a book offensive is a simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence.  So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not?  Just because somebody running a library belives a book to be offensive or innappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf.  There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive.     Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already.  Movies for example, are all rated, and this therfore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch.  The viewer should not expect to check out a rated '@CAPS1' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects.  By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films.  It is simply not thier responsibility.     Music also is rated, and if thought neccessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content.  Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be innappropriate.     Magazines @MONTH1 not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'.  As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material; not the librarian's.     Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians.  Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise."

Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional.      Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it. For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod take it from them. It is not a right to have the device it is a privelage and parents are aloud to take away privelages.     In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically. Most media is viewed, because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music. If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current oppurtunities for profit.      Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press. These offensive materials are included in this right. I understand admentments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that. Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers.      In brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits. Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material"
"Just like magic, I'll be flying free,   I'ma disappear when they come for me..I feel a song comin' on   And I'm warning ya   It's a victorious   Happy and glorious new strain!.Mama was..Some will last,   Some will just be now and then..One good man,   Oh ain't much, honey ain't much,   It's only everything, whoa..And why have the birds wings to fly?.Always asking questions   We're always asking questions      Why this?.If I could hold on   To just one thought   For long enough to know   Why my mind is moving so fast   And the conversation is slow..It's outrageous a man like me stand here and complain..Ready as this audience that's coming here to dream..Deep in a rosy glow   The face of my love you show   Day dream   I walk along on air   Building a castle there   For me and my love to share   Don't know the time   Lordy, I'm in a daze   Sun in the sky   While I moon around, feeling hazy   Day dream   Don't break my reverie   Until I find that he   Is daydreaming just like me   Don't know the time   Lordy, I'm in a daze   Sun in the sky   While I moon around, feeling hazy   Day dream   Don't break my reverie   Until I find that he   Is daydreaming just like me.Discoverer!.A dictionary's necessary but not for talking,   It's used for walking the Ziegfeld way..I love all kinds of weather   As log as we're together..Seem to have developed, different beaks..But I remember, oh, I remember when I was gay..I heard about a king   Who was doing swell   Till he started playing   With that evil Jezebel..I really can't stay   Baby it's cold outside   I've got to go away   Baby it's cold outside   This evening has been   Been hoping that you'd drop in   So very nice   I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice   My mother will start to worry   Beautiful, what's your hurry?.You don't know how lips hurt   Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,   Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,   You don't know what love is..This royal steed will never cease..Fail to follow through with all I must do..From night to dawn   You soldiered on, did ya?.No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone thinks it's offensive. I believe that poeple have the right to read what they want and so do authers have the right to wright what they want. One of the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 statements is @CAPS5 of speech giving people the right to say and wright what they want.     People shouldn't take anything out of libraries because libraries are built for storing things like books, magazines, music, and movies. If people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library. If everything is taken out then nobody would have any reason for going to a library.     This brings up the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. ''@CAPS5 of speech'' meens that people have the right to wright what they want to. if others find it offensive, then don't reed it. Also @CAPS5 of expresion lets people do this to. If people wish to express themselves by reeding it then they have that right.     One of my personal experiences is that I love music, so do my two best friends. One of them goes to the library to find music and we both listen to it. He found these bands I had never heard and I realy liked them. If someone found them ''offensive'' I would have never got to hear how good they were.      This is why I believe that people shouldn't take things out of the libraries. not only does it deny others of something they could love but it also destroys history. libraries will be around for a long time and they store so much information,it would be a shame to deny future people the right to read these wonderfull peices of work someone worked real hard on to create."

If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library.     I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them.       In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day.     What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything"
"And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories   And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,   Homeward bound,   I wish I was,   Homeward bound,   Home where my

Lord   Envelop me within the clouds..You pretended like we were friends   I was blinded by sentiment   You complicated what love should be   And I could swear that you're using me      I keep seeing things I shouldn't see   I've been watchin' you   Are you using me?.I can learn to live alone and move on with my life   There's a million things that I can do to occupy my time   I can wake each

your mind      I can use my hands to wipe the dust off this guitar   And let this music that I'm playing take the mind off my heart      [Chorus]   But I don't know how   don't know how   don't know how, not to Love you   I don't know how   don't know how   don't know how, not to Love you      [Bridge]      You said that time would ease the pain   But I still hear your voice whisper my name

I think you should have to have permission from a parent, or guardian if the material is explicit. For example in a store where you buy cd's, games ect... you have to be of age to buy the material that should be the same with books.          Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1' it shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someones standards it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up read the back and see what it's actualy about. Then if it's what you was exspecting it to be talk to someone who is in charge, and explain top them what the problem is in your case.     Also you could always have a section of the store, or librarie just for adults only. It @MONTH1 sound stupid, but it can actualy help out alot. There is tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children. Such as love books, they talk about love, and passion in ways that are very innappropriate for children.      If there was a section of a store or librarie it could help keep these things out of your children, or other childrens minds. You or anyone else wouldnt have to worry about children picking certain material up that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time your in a librarie and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see"

darkness won't delay   To steal her cherry lips away   For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down   The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown   In kissing sips we drown      And Adam will have his way   Adam will have his way      Adam's on the island, living in the land of love   Shadows lurk around him, drunk on the royal jelly of pure love   Full and ripe, the fruit hang, for when the prince arrives he will want more   And more and more he will drink from the canvas cup   The son of a swan will then loose his plumera   And he will wear a new age suit and haunt the joints in town   And play a silver magic flute and call his lovers down   And call his lovers down      And Adam will have his way   Adam will have his way   Will have his way      Adam's at the easel painting in the wrinkles and the gray   Waiting for November, easy with the darkness of the day   Smiles a tear of gladness, and Adam's at the window once again   He's burning in the sunlight, too late to wait, for darkness won't delay   To steal her cherry lips away   For while the careless tongues of sunlight slowly trickle down   The curve of hips, her fingertips, in kissing sips we drown   In kissing sips we drown      And Adam will have his way      Adam's at the window.Starlight, I hear you callin' out to me..Well, the bell hops tears keep flowin',   And the

the shelves if they are found offensive because, some students read book on a daily basics and reading also keep some students out of trouble. The @CAPS8 I say that is because if you find a book you might be interesting in the book and you might share @CAPS2 with you youger sisters or brothers to keep them from doing the wrong things. Also some books that are offensive shows students to not do the things they see in the book. Some books that are offensive show how people that do bad thing have to pay the cost and people can learn from other people mistakes. Some books that are offensive show people what to do or what not to do so you wouldn' t have to pay that cost from doing something wrong.     Also music can be offensive because of the curseing that some of the songs have in @CAPS2.The music is sometimes good to listen to because songs speak and takes action in a certain way.The offensive part about the music is that some music is calm music and @CAPS2 keeps you motivated inside and some music have bad vibes to @CAPS2 and can make you do bad things.Most of the time music can make you happy and you can undertsand alot in life just by listening to music. Music is a description of life meaning that life is ful of offensive things but you have to be very selfcentered to understand.     Some movies can also be offensive because of the actions in the movies. Movies are enjoyable and you can also relate to some movies in your own way. At times movies can be very interesting because of the actions and drama in the movies. The titles in the movie can also be offensive but that don't mean the movie is a bad relation in the story.     Magazines can also be offensive because of the things inside of the magazine. Some magazines shows appropriate things that children and adults can relate to. Also there are different things like activitys and things for family and freinds to enjoy. Many magazines are different in there own way @CAPS2 depends on how the cover is and the person who created the magzine. Some things are good about magazines because they show you posters of some of the super stars in the music career.     There are alot of things that can be offensive in the world but you have to learn how to seperate yourself from the negative things in life. Also all things are not offensive because you can relate to some of the books and music that we here in these days. The most important thing is that you don't have to listen what the magazines and movies are telling you because, you have a mind of your own. People don't listen to what the books and etc, are going by because some of the things they are talking about is false information. So thats why i say @CAPS7 i do believe that cartain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

said,tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go..People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into.      If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear.     Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it.     We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'@CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can."

Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many diffrent intrest. Wheather that be cars, boats, toys, or animals it shouldn't matter what the intrest is. I firmly beleive that a library should have books over tons of things. Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possible learn about it.      This is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast!! There are to many people making enimies all over the world. I was asked to submit my opinion and i beleive that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want too. If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked outh then they don't have to watch it.      There are multiple solutions to the problem. The librarys could have diffrent sections for diffrent types of books or such as sorting them by class or hobbies. There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anyting that they shouldn't be watching or reading.That way the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with.      Well i cant wait to see how the results turn out!! I also hope they people make the right vote. Im not saying that my vote is the only way, its just my opinion. Either way there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 for letting me voice my opinion!"

The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.     Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. @CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!     Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.  By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.     Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.     In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society"

the road I look and there runs Mary   Hair of gold and lips like cherries..Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book sheleves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries?     There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from romance, action packed, and scary. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines.      I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very well either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about.     I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best.      Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way."

It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of @DATE1 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in @DATE1's society.     Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies.     Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society.     The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media."

hand,   She's got one end in her mouth..ABC, baby, nah nah!.How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.     For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority @MONTH1 find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics.      My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person.     People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.     Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present."

I do not believe so. In this essay I will describe to you why I think this way.      The word offensive is a contreversial word. Is it kissing that makes books and media offensive or is it curse words or fighting. Many people see many different things.      Many off the books today's youth read are 'offensive' to older generations. That is because today's standerds are different. Children are more free to do what they want and say what they want, making offensive a changed word.     If a book, song, or video is offensive then the parents should take that up with their children. Things that are offensive for some people are just fine for other people. Just because it is out there does not mean that we have to see it.      So in conclusion I do not think that books and media should be removed from the shelf for being offensive, because offensive is a changing word and it is different for every person."

Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable.      In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books @MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin.      There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on.      Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's @PERSON1 on the front page with no hair, or @LOCATION1's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely.      People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you dont want to see it, don't buy it. Its quite simple"

library shelves.  I stand frmly with this because it is a choice to read material that is found offensive.  I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropiate materials because they are not interested in them.  Just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book.  Basically there is a maturity barrier that seperates what each age level is interested in reading.     There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing.  People who would get offended mainly children are already exposed to violent videogames which glorify war and violence.  And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive.     If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well.  A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button.  Also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material.     Some people might enjoy material that is offensive.  If material is removed  alot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted.  There would be alot of complaints, and problems.  And some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited..     The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have.  Many people will be satasified, and most people will be happy"

up to you..Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindeling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experince to read or listen to what we want, who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to?     As an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life. The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want, wether it is offensive or not.     If you want to put certain restictions on a book such as a age limit i can understad that, but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as an @CAPS2 citisen. To read and watch or listen other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard.     Music and television i understand some censorship, i dont want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the '@CAPS3 bomb' or seeing anythin obsene, but these days its getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media.      Many kids today have access to the enternet which can be good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer. Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4, but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible weather it be fiction, classics such as 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6', or educational litterature.     So is our reading choices becoming scarese? Yes i believe so, na it all has to do with censorship. We cant read some of the classics because the're 'racist' or are 'pornagraphic', but you have to understand for the time they were written the weren't. so let everyone read what they want when they want."

always stay      And our love will keep on shining   Through the wind and the rain   And when the day is over   Our love will shine again   And as the years fly over   I'm feeling younger every day

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style.     Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive.  These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader.  While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it.  However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct.     'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book.  Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some.  However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong.  Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it.  None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response.     Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'?  Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are a tool of knowledge.  Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge.  Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others.  Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written.     '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story.  How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books?  They often state that it is their favorite book of all time.  If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it.     Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions.  How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp?  If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons."

There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world. They love to pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read. Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lyes with the parents.           If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book.      if we  had all of this then there would not be any more problems. it would be a nice controled libaray. so in conclustion this is the way to go. this is the futur of tommorw"

If we made the change the age limited on movie we might be even better off . If parent were to watch the movie then the parent would be able to tell them what ok an what not. we need to put more true history stuff in them an make them where you want to watch them we could be teaching kids more stuff so they know.the music should be censorship some what like with rap. there is alot of rap music that should be cleaned up so little kid dont hear it.      There might even be a better way to controll this stuff so little kids cant get a hold of it. We can have teacher help tell the kids an let them no that it not right for them to watch that. we also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on tv. There are some that need to be clean up. There are also lot of different in what people want. Then there some that dont care about it to. Maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to do it"

They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults they have coffe tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books. never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out.              Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are book stores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries.     The world is full of offensive things period. Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library."

days of old..Hey hey..in the U.S.A., Yeah, Yeah!.Bows and flows of angel hair, and ice cream castles in the air   Feathered canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way   Now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone      So many things I could have done, but clouds got in my way   I've looked at clouds from both sides now from up and down and still somehow   It's cloud's illusion I recall, I really don't know clouds at all      Moons and Junes and ferris wheels..Oooohhh I've seen it all..[Chorus]   I've got some things to say, oh   Please don't go, oh   So don't you turn away, oh   Please don't go, oh   I need you here to stay, I   Miss you so      My daddy left me, and he ain't even die   So when he did go, I ain't even cry   I had reason, but that ain't even why   How could he have failed if he ain't even try   I ask no questions, I ain't even pry   Truthfully I wanted to I can't even lie   Like a canceled flight, that ain't even fly   To just walk away, like you ain't even my   Like, like, like I ain't even your   I cant even say it, I ain't even sure   He shoulda gave me everything and left me even more   But he left me without saying what he was leavin' for   And that's when I became a man   And that's the day he stopped bein' one   This year I became a father   And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son      [Chorus]      I have nightmares of me not bein' round   He took his first steps and daddy couldn't be in town   Daddy's entertaining everybody   But missed out when it came to trainin' for the potty   I give a fuck about hip-hops new beef   I was more excited when my son grew teeth   So I same the problem   Of the famous stardom   Just like Em and Haily   Just like Game and Harlem   Weezy's at the awards with Miss..I'll be your bridge,

Love you so it hurts my soul   Can you forgive me for trying again   Your silence makes me hold my breath   Time has passed you by      Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world   Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own   Here I am left in silence      You gave up the fight   You left me behind   All that's done's forgiven   You'll always be mine   I know deep inside   All that's done's forgiven      I watched the clouds drifting away   Still the sun can't warm my face   I know it was destined to go wrong   You were looking for the great escape   To chase your demons away      Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world   Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own   And here I am left in silence      You gave up the fight   You left me behind   All that's done's forgiven   You'll always be mine   I know deep inside   All that's done's forgiven      I've been so lost since you've gone   Why not me before you?.I know how to do it on my own,   This is not your life,   I know how to do it on my own,   This is not your life,   And I know how to do it on my own,   And this is not your life,   I know how to do it on my own,   And this is not your life,.And Neither one of us will ever be the same..I love my dog as much as I love you   But you may fade, my dog will always come through..I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like."

If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?"

Ugh!.Toiling has bought too many tears,   Turn 'round all those past years..You're something special, oh so special,   You're the girl for me..Whose to say what is appropriate for whom? whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors.          In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. Causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll as if your they're last place where they can ask for help, where you should be they're first resort.         No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. Its altering a authors work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal not required.          Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language. Or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young?      I conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. Or everything is censored and everything is controlled  I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nuture"

their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for."

These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials.  What about the adults?  Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults.     Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them.  To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this.  Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it.  This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism.  If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them.     Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of.  Offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship.  Some adults like the original songs with the original words.  Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to.     Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over.  They are being rated @CAPS3, suitable for all ages, @NUM1, suitable for children @NUM2 and older, and rated @CAPS4, suitable for people @NUM3 and older.  These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie.  Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs.  If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @NUM1 or rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.     Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme.  If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian."

Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that one book. There will always be many more books there to look at. If there is a bad book just go to a different section in the library. There is going to be more good books for a person than bad books.     If other people would like the book then the library will not take the book off of the shelves. It @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book. Some people go to the library just to see them kind of books. Certain people like certain types of books, maybe it was not the right section for a person to be in. The book could be a interesting book all there is to do is try it. If anything the reader might even like the book and check it out.     The books are there for entertainment. Thats why they have so much different sections and selections to choose from. If an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid. A different parent might come in and think that the book will be great for their child though.      Books should be sat out on the shelf for anybody that goes to the library. The librarians will not take books off the shelf for one persons opinion.

Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them. Are you?     There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head. Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people. If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book. Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended.      There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there. Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that @MONTH1 offend someone. It would be very helpful to so many people!      In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inapropriate and those books can be removed. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read. Let's put a stop to it.     In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading!"
"Hey, hey, hey.I was found in Wilson County just a mile outside of town   On the doorsteps of two people who brought me up to where I am   I was born to be a loser and my name nobody knows   And as far as they concern I'm just a bad seed daddy sowed   They brough me up to the age of ten before they let me know   And since that day it seemed that life lost its magic glow   But they raised me right and every night in prayer we bowed our heads   And they asked the Lord to light my path and guide each step I made   But the path you're walking on becomes a mighty rocky road   When you know that all you'll ever be is a bad seed daddy sowed   At thirty one my heart was won by a girl half my age   And with love so strong I could see no wrong in decision that I made   And you know I learned that there was truth in all I always been told   Because you can't judge a book by its cover   And everything that's shinin' sure isn't gold   Yes I guess I'm guilty of dreaming an impossible dream   Because the way the things turned out sure isn't way it seemed   And so tonight I'm leavin' behind the only thing I ever had to call my own   And I know as long as you live you're always be a reminder of all my wrongs   But I hope that he'll forgive me when he's old enough to know   That just like me he'll always be the bad seed his daddy sowed.Please please please please   (please please, oh oh)

Taking items such as a books, music, movies, magazines, ect., will not stop people from getting offended. The @CAPS2 question's are who decides what is offensive, and how is it offensive? What makes something offensive"

Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.      Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears.      If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon?      Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed.     For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction"
"But girl, I got to have you for myself..It's just another full moon..If a black cat crossed your path, little woman,   Would you walk along with me?.And the song that is coming through..No sweeter name than the name of Jesus   No sweeter name have I ever known   No sweeter name than the name of Jesus      No sweeter name than the name of Jesus   No sweeter name have I ever known   No sweeter name than the name of Jesus      You are the life to my heart and my soul   You are the light to the darkness around me   You are the hope to the hopeless and broken   You are the only truth and the way      No sweeter name than the name of Jesus   No sweeter name have I ever known   No sweeter name than the name of Jesus      No sweeter name than the name of Jesus   No sweeter name have I ever known   No sweeter name than the name of Jesus      You are the life to my heart and my soul   You are the light to the darkness around me   You are the hope to the hopeless and broken   You are the only truth and the way      You are the life to my heart and my soul   You are the light to the darkness around me   You are the hope to the hopeless and broken   You are the only truth and the way, the truth and the way      Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus      You are the life to my heart and my soul   You are the light to the darkness around me   You are the hope to the hopeless and broken   You are the only truth and the way.[Chorus]   Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,   And you don't ask the time of day..Hide the switch and shut the light, let it all come down tonight..The things you, want but don't get..Behind the wheel was Frank      Well I chased him through them county roads   Till a sign said ""Canadian border five miles from here""   I pulled over the side of the highway and watched his tail-lights disappear      Me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin'   Nothin' feels better than blood on blood   Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band   Played ""Night of the Johnstown Flood"".(Why can't I turn off the radio?).Riff      1 2!.What's it all about?.Every time I run away from you   You searched me out and found me   I build a wall, surround myself   But you've found a way around it   Everywhere I go in this big old world   You're just one step behind me   I turn around and there you are   Ready to remind me   Woah, baby, let me, let me go   Honey, don't you know?.Just clap your liver lips and I'll run my business,   Brother,   Clap your liver lips and I'll run my business, brother,   If I'd followed your advice on how to make dough,   I'd been in the jailhouse long ago..All of the world can taste his glory..I ain't naive, I got a line or two..You claim the belt, the glory I bask in   I bee hop in the ring, niggas ya cash in   It's like stoppin' a train,   Nigga think he's stoppin' my reign   Talk slick while droppin' my name?.But bless her heart, she couldn't stay,   I begged her not to go away..Well, are you ready to fall in love?.I never ask you where you're going, so don't ask me      I'm not so good so far   Fell off the beaten track   'cause sometimes we go forward   Must take two steps back      Chorus   (solo)   Chorus.Smashed potatoes, sliced tomatoes, apple juice, blueberry, raspberry, cherries and peaches in a fraction of a second!.As my tears drop on my crystal ball,   Magnifies the reflections of christ..Certain materials, such as books, music, magizines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, to have the freedom to say what the wish within the context of their own individual wrighting. Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well.      If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. Several great leaders, such as the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people. It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they @MONTH1 be.     Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. Many people in this world serve in their nations military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people percieve literature and art. @ORGANIZATION3 would hate @ORGANIZATION2's art, and @ORGANIZATION2 would hate @ORGANIZATION3's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world.     Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. Others @MONTH1 teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used.      Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be."

Should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not?     I dont think any of the books, or magazines should be censered. If some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them. The parents @MONTH1 not let some kids read them but some parents just dont care. I think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say.       Should the movies you get at libraries be censered? I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching. The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it. The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it.      Should all books.magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censered? No. If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit. If the book, movie, magazine, or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out. A public library can but there are mostly adults there. The kids should know what they can and cant watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something they cant read, watch, listen to, or look at. Some parents @MONTH1 agree to censering them but if you do that you are limiting the books everyone can read. Even the parents or adults wouldnt be able to read them aswell"

That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be?     I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There @MONTH1 be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing.     Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library.      No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice.     Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good"

Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves. Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like.      If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true. Every library in the world should not take certian books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1. If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources.     Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books,movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see whats new ,or watching all different types of moive, and listening to music.     I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, moive, or magazine that would offend people today.     Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended, they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about"

bad sign..Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.     There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve?

I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate.     With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to. Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive. Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a persons life.     With censoring there would be no diverstiy. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small.     I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society.     I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys. It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society"

Feeling like I'll die by myself   Why?.Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these procautions?     In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch @CAPS1.V. or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, @CAPS2, and videogames.     I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for.     When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it.     Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don'@CAPS1 care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library."

My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. This also includes music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. The less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway.         We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. theres even songs about it, no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items we @MONTH1 see positive results.     Like I said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials. They will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they're older. In the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf."

a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, ect., to extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, ect., would have to be scary. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are. Would you want your child, that's @NUM1, to go out and do what the other @NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do?     Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now? Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now. Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit. These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss.      I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if i had any problems today. If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore; neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol. You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life. Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities.     So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it. Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it. Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong. Lets make these profanities go away on their own. If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either"

You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.     Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains 'offensive material.' @CAPS1's ridiculous; @CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.     How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can't enjoy @CAPS1. If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1. @CAPS1's not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn't have to voiced.     We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think @CAPS1's approprite to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1's mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If @CAPS1 weren't appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.     To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive. We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else."

Wait, I know that book! That book is absolutely offensive! How dare you read that!' Then, imagine that they snatch that book up, and you never see it again. This is an example of how censorship works. If the government notices citizens in our country with offensive magazines, books, movies, or music, is it right for them to grab it away? No, not in any way do they have a right to do that!      Everybody should be able to decide for themselves @CAPS1 is right or wrong to; watch, read, or hear. Nobody has to be exposed to anything that they don't want to. Also, if a person truley wants to find an offensive form of entertainment, they will find it, no matter if it is legal to or not. Therefore, I believe that trying to stop people from this is a fruitless action.     Remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story, '@CAPS2 The @ORGANIZATION2'? Well, you can't read it anymore, the government declared the book offensive to camels and took it away. Now, you have only a boring book on facts about camels. @CAPS1 fun is that? And I have to think, '@CAPS1 about the authors?' @CAPS4 thing that is amazing about our country is our freedom of speech and expression! Stopping all that creativity from our author is tough and cruel. Writing a great story is near impossible to accomplish with limitaions that could result from government censorship.     If a song is beautiful and sweet, but contains @CAPS4 bad word in it, is it a bad song? If there was censorship, who would decide @CAPS1 is appropiate? Would the @CAPS5 decide for us? Or would the @ORGANIZATION1 get together and read aloud the books before they were declared inappropiate? Personally, I would love to decide for myself. And, as a mature adult, I can. I have the morals and the mind to choose for myself @CAPS1 is good or bad.     Perhaps, the multitude of books and songs that we have now would disappear altogether. It is possible. It is incredibly difficult to imagine the entire country having the same moral opinions on our entertainment. This could cause a number of entertainment forms to be eliminated. So, how can we create a standard to approve these forms of entertainment?     Understanding that there are young, fragile children, that are privy to all forms all public entertainment, some censorship @MONTH1 be required. However, I strongly believe that this should be limited. The censorship should be used only to help the kids. This is similar to the way a parent has their children eat healthy food instead of junk as they are growing up. When the kids are grown, they decide for themselves @CAPS1 food to eat. Some of the items I believe should be censored are; public commercials, children's television shows, and children's movies. The things I, and many others, believe should be censored are; profanity, violence, and offensiveness toward race, religion, and gender. Later, these children will be able to chose for themselves @CAPS1 they think is acceptable, and the censorship can end.     Total censorship is bad. Each and every citizen has the right to read whatever they please to. And nobody should ever try to take that away. Please, don't ever let people tell you your own morals."

Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.      One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections.  Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice.  It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book.     Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned.  If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today.  If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone.  Censorship holds back many artists true potential.  Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world.     I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left.  Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else.     Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something.  As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right.   Censorship shouldnt be in libraries."
"I can bring this number to   When you're good to Mama   Mama's good to you.Let's get it!.Grrr      I'm a gangster, I'm a straight up G   The gangster life is the life for me   Shooting people by day, selling drugs by night   Being a gangster is hella tight..I've flown around the world in a plane   I've settled revolutions in Spain   The North Pole I have charted   But can't get started with you      Around the golf course I'm under par   And all the movies want me to star   I've got a house, a show place   But I get no place with you      You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you   scheme, just for a sign of you   dream, both day and night of you   and what good does it do      In nineteen twenty nine I sold short   In England I'm presented at court   But you got me so downhearted   Because I can't get started with you      You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you   scheme, just for a sign of you   dream, both day and night of you   and what good does it do      In nineteen twenty nine I sold short   In England I'm presented at court   But you got me so downhearted   Because I can't get started with you.I took a chance and I lost control   Trying to find out why   On a night in July......Down neon streets the streaker streaks..I can see the rain   Come into my room again   Broken window pane   Now reminds me I'm alive      Could it be right   Giving up, my darling   I'll wait for you now   To remind me why I've gone      How I love to write   Songs that have no answers   Oh, there's nothing on my mind   That I want to let go of      Letting it go on pretending   Everything has its way of ending   And I'm a loner   The way I should be      Set it free   Let it free my love to fly   Set it free   Set it free   Let it free my love to be   Can I be free?.Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,   Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,   Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail..I want to get away   I want to fly away   Yeah yeah yeah      I want to get away   I want to fly away   Yeah yeah yeah      I got to get away   Feel I got to get away   Oh oh oh yeah      I want to get away   I want to fly away   Yeah with you yeah yeah   Oh Yeah !.And all the ladies sing,   So, oh, oh oh oh..I'm a dead man walking..And you may have thought it tragic,   Not to mention other adjec-   Tives, to think of all the weeping they will do..Honey, I'm home and it's late, the day is over   You've been running through my mind all day long   And there's somethin' I'm just dying to tell you   We're not lovin' enough here at home..Even with my dark side?.Hand me a tissue   Hand me your hand   I feel like crying please understand   I have been foolish      I crossed that line   That borders friendship   In this bed of mine   We slept together      And it felt so wrong   Now I know forever   That that friendship has gone   She wore the night shirt      You would have worn   If you'd been there   If I had've tried   To stop myself acting      Like I chose to do   Is this the end   Need we pretend   I slept with a friend      And hurt you      Hand me your pencil   Hand me your heart   I feel like writing where do I start   We drank together and jumped into bed      I had the pleasure   Then I lost my friend   We slept together and the guilt's so strong   Now I know forever      That that friendship has gone.Baby, you've been on my mind tonight   I'm so low, I just had to sit down and write   I spent all yesterday tryin' to figure out what I'm gonna say   One letter from the heart is so hard to start, baby   How's your momma, how's the weather, how's that son of mine?.It?.I walk the wire every night   I can't decide between wrong and right   I've lost control over the things I do   'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you      Now the one who never took a chance   Becomes a victim of circumstance   I've lost my way now I'm so confused   'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you      All my dreams are far behind me   They don't matter any more   I don't care about the things I could lose   'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you      Now the one who always played it safe   Becomes another who's lost his way   I can't believe it though I know it's true   'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you      All my dreams begin to blind me   And I was so confused   And I don't care about the things I could lose   'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you      I'm not gonna fight it I'm gonna choose   To hopelessly fall oh yeah   You know I'll hopelessly fall in love with you.Let's have a party..But I caught you way worse   They say, ""You want a war?.Ain't it a shame when a girl goes bad,   It's enough to drive you mad.. Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? I thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. And then you wouldnt have even known about it. Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see."

I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer.     Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business.     From what i've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already. Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them."

These books, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf?      If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young Children need books to help their imagination grow.  If there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf.  One book or movie @MONTH1 seem offensive to you, but @MONTH1 not to another person.     A world without books. No imagination. No adventures. It would be a boring world.  I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all. That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes"

Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contian offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that dont consider them to be offensive.     What is offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from as song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday.     These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certian magazine @MONTH1 not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likley be nothing left. Removing them could cause choas to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certian materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesnt offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.     Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience teenagers are interested in alot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain alot of physical and sexual content along with a decnt amount of foul language. A older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more becasue they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing alot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.     Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor @MONTH1 not offend me. Chances are that there will alwasy be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They @MONTH1 still be offended on the insided but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing"

How does that really help? Even if you remove certian book or music from a library doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else. Besides many of the things that people should be censored is probably not that bad. I think it is better for some one to read about somthing the have it happen to them and then experince it. Like Katherine Paterson said if we let people get rid of book of music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to what will we have left. Nothing! Through people think censorring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many bad side to have much of a good effect.     When people try to censor things they normally just take things off of shelfs and get rid of them. But, in today world of technology that doesn't stop people from obtaining there goal. We have the internet that lets people upload book and music to share. So yeah, you many not be able to get a book at the library but you can almost always find it online. In result trying to censor libraries by removing books and music really is doing anything.     How do you determine what should be censored? People all have a different idea of what is ok for the public and what is not. Some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them. Then you loss business and make poeple mad at the same time. In some way isn't it better for people to learn about bad things like crime and death through ways that aren't real and don't hurt. When things like that happen in a book they normally don't just stop there. They show the results or how the situation was handled. Which could come to help people who end up in the same sort of situatuions later on it there life. Which makes it really hard to determine what should be censored and what shouldn't.     Katherrine Paterson even said that if we let people censor what they think is unmoral nothing will be left. Everything will be gone, because every person in the world would find something is every book that they could find bad. Even if there is a book that people agree should be censored, there are people that think the other way. No books would be left if we  censored libraries because people could find thing bad or unmoral in every book.      Overall, censoring libraries ends up being more pain than it worth. It is not stoping people from obtaining the information another way. There is no way to decide what shuld be censored. And, censoring somethings will lead to people wanting other things to be censored, which will leave nothing. In conclusion, censoring doesn't really stop people and ends up leading to bigger problems in the end."

Also if they are books that can be offensive and that it can or not be removed by the libraries.I think that the libraries have the right to have any materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more on the shelves. Well in my opinion I think that they should not remove any books because people @MONTH1 think that it can be offensive but other people @MONTH1 be into those books. So no I don't think they should remove any because some people have different opinions on different books.When I go to libraries they are books that I can enjoy reading or not like but that is just my opinion. Some people might like the book that I did not liked or hate but I think that the books should not be removed from the shelves because some people might enjoy it and some won't.I think they should not remove books because the books are for people that are interseted on the books that they want to read or learn about the stuff about the past or just fiction books.I just talked about the essay I just wrote I talked about the books about the libraries, and how some books can be offensive to other people that are trying to pick books, and also if they should or not remove books from the shelves"

Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view?     For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages.     Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to.     Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you.     With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech."

All of these  are factors found in our books and music we have today. Do you believe these items should be cencered? If books or music have these types of messages in them it is going to influence children and adult's choices on what they do in life. I feel that, yes books and music should be cencored.          My first supporting reason of why books and music should be cencored is the fact that children and adults get a huge influence from the information. Look in today's world; murders are happening, gang violence, and even abuse. If a book or song is advertising about murdering some one, or selling drugs nine times out of ten people think that is the 'cool' thing to do so why not do it. With people following uncencored books and songs it leaves dead people, inmates, and poor choices. Most people want to follow what an artist or author is doing because they are famous, which is causing peer preasure.     The second reason books and music should be censored is the simple fact of respect. Some books or music affends people by their race, religion, or their apperance. You find most of the critizisium from music more than books, but it does occur. Young children and teens shouldn't listen to or read about racism, sex, how to drugs, ect. Books and music that have advertisment about these types of things is disrespectful to parents and what they teach their children. The message brought from the book or song is basically saying go against your parents and do this. A person should be able to sit and listen to a nice song, or book without getting disrespected and offended.     My final reasoning for books and music being cencored is the reputation it will have or has. Books and music are just like people, they can send off the wrong message leaving a bad reputation upon others. For instance, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 tend to have a lot of bad messaged songs, so therefore most people think that all @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are bad. If songs and books were cencored there wouldn't be a sterio type against a certain type of music, or books have the best message. A normal person bases the first song, or book they hear/read by if or not they or their child can listen to or read that type of material.      Love, positive messages, influencing good, these are the types of things most people want to hear or read. If books and music are cencored there will not be any more cursing on the radio, bad ideas given to those influenced, and could stop less violence. Again I state, yes I feel books and music should be cencored."

your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of  music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive.     First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves. Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start.     secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger. Same with music, movies, and magazines.     So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do"

Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. If people would like to buy inapporpriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not.     Certain material such at rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers. Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that.     People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library.     Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library.     I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far to young to know about.     The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it."

taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 the author, Katherine Paterson. Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them. I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle.     First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inapropriate things. And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and I.D. so that kids and children don't accidently slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better.     Secondly, if an indivual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away. That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough compaints. Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see.     Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inapropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas.     Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library. There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inapropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inapropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it."

The reason for this thought is because, although it @MONTH1 be offensive to one person does not mean it's offensive to another. Taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples' knowledge of our world. This in turn makes the world illiterate.     Libraries provide multiple things that are not family disscreation but, to the right age group offers alot of knowledge. Movies are a large portion of this problem but, they are there do to entertainment  reasons. I feel that all items that are equipped in a library should be looked at as a way of knowledge and not as weither it is offensive to a certain quanity of people. The removal of these things @MONTH1 become harmful to a new generation in the long run.     I personally think as a person who attends the library often, that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways.  I have read multiple books that have been aquired from all different sections of the library. Some even pertainig to racism of my own ethinticity that uses words that are not to my liking. I tolerate with the words do to the fact that I would like to know what my ancestory had to do in order for me to get where I am today.             Magazines are also a small portion of this conflict. As like movies though they are there to provide entertainment. Most people like to use the library for a time of relaxtion. The library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something.      In conclusion, As a fellow person of the community and a frequent library attende, I think that things should not be taking off of shelves. Libraries provides various things that are not at a family disccreation level but, @MONTH1 provide help to other people. Some books pertain to racism of ethnitcity. It's not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are. Things like magazines are there for your entertainment and if you think it's inappropriate then you should'nt read or watch it."

do, do, do, do.).Strangers in the night, two lonely people   We were strangers in the night   Up to the moment   When we said our first hello..The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves"

Did me wrong eveytime we were together... Gether   And that's why....Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor"

I can't choose @CAPS3 they are both understandable. Therefore, I well dicuss how i feel about it in this essay and what I have experience on this topic.     Well lets get started! I could go both ways with this. But first I well just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that is instersting to many people mght not be instersting to me. I mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy. And I could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to. Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we wouldn't every think we would. It's just that simply. I mean I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both. Noone can tell anyone what they should like or dislike.          I agree in away too! When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you make sure room is clean all the time! I agree with this @CAPS3 something maybe to offensive to someone and doesn't want their children. One time I was in a library looking at this book that really seemed good to read. But then some lady told me that I shouldn't read it @CAPS3 it to much for me. But it was just right for me. @CAPS2 went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was like, 'Are you serious?' I didn't want to be rude so I told her calmly, '@CAPS1 are you so worried about what I am reading?' @CAPS2 replied, ' @CAPS3, the book is to reviling.' I showed her what the book was called, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. We ended the agruement. I still checked out the book, @CAPS3 I knew I would love it, and I do! They should just put things aside, that they think well be offensive and let people ask for the things. So people won't make a big deal out of it. Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want.          Well I'm done now. Hope you understand both sides of the agruement. Just remember that if you agree or disagree.Or you like me, who can't choice or understands both sides. It's your decision and noone can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to. But I can't pick aside @CAPS3 either way their both a understandable."

mind   I never thought I'd ever fall this low but here I am with a man I hardly know   In a booth back in a corner...   [ steel ]   I do the things a proper lady wouldn't do   And it all started that first night when I lost you   To see me now you wouldn't know me I'm changed so   Cause here I am with a man I hardly know   In a booth back in a corner....Offensive much? Thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books. For instence if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an athiest, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtfull to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a resourse that is very helpfull, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects.      First, besides books, we have magazines. If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. Second there would be less gossip. Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebritys. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves.     Lastly there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' @CAPS4 if you don't then i'll tell you a little about @CAPS5. @CAPS5's about america, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. In the chorus @CAPS5 says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3,- but we tried to fight @CAPS5. @CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @CAPS5's a song that is about americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the begining of time @CAPS5 already was. The song inspired many of the famous singers you @CAPS4 know. Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know. We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to americans. Without mucis there would be chaos.     Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our intertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. For instince the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind.     In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education. Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. I hope I have made a positive inpact on your thoughts, and feelings."

No, I won't fall off the edge of the earth,   I won't let go, just wait and see....There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act.     @ORGANIZATION1 depicts beautiful as half dressed and makup put on like plaster. Many magazines and books, such as @CAPS1 and books about modeling, portray beautiful as stick thin and your clothes almost falling off your body. Many songs and movies tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these magazines, books, and movies at your local bookstore, don't you think that they could possibly be two miles down the road at your local @CAPS2 library?      Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers. They are intended for people of all ages. Many people do not realize this, but at many libraries, there are sections specified for teenagers. Young adult books and magazines should not even be put in the teenager section, only for the reason that there are subjects in many of the young adult books that a lot of teenagers have not even begun to dicuss yet. If these books and magazines are put in here for teenagers, do you not think a five year old child could wander up to the section, take out a magazine and wonder how the women in the advertisements grew up to be so beautiful? Like I said before, @ORGANIZATION1 depicts people to look beautiful, when it's all photo-shopped.      If a five year old child can get their hands on books and magazines that they shouldn't even know about, @CAPS3 would a library keep them on their shelves. The thoughts that the five year old child has now is '@CAPS3 am I not that beautiful?' @CAPS4 image is the key to how people view society today. Modeling agencies, photographers, and even cheerleading coaches make girls feel like they are worthless because they are 'too fat', 'too ugly', or 'too short' to be part of what they have wanted to be in their entire lives. Many women that @CAPS8 starve themselves every day just to maintain the 'healthy weight' which is @NUM1 pounds and you can see every rib in her body.      Many books, magazines, and television shows portray this as well. You can find them in libraries nation-wide. The magazine, @CAPS1, has articles about how to become skinny. The television show, @LOCATION1's @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, shows people that being tall and as skinny as a stick is the way to go. Many workout books tell you that being like @PERSON1 is the 'best for your bod' way to be. You cannot tell a girl that she needs to be a specific height and a specific weight by a specific time. Woman don't work that way. No one does.      Many magazines, books, movies, and music tell you this, and it is not true. I believe that if libraries took these types of materials out of their facilities, then if would drop the rate of society's '@CAPS4 image' rapidly. Many woman and girls wouldn't feel like they are ugly or fat. They would love who they were and they would not believe what another person says about them or what they look like. Being beautiful is not just on the outside. Anyone can have a beautiful heart and that will shine through more than anything else."

It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached. I say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are.     I think that there should be no censoring of libraries. It would impair our basic rights. Such as our right to freedom of expression. And our right freedom to the press.We would no longer live in a free country but a totalterrian state.     Though if they would put an age restriction on certian things that @MONTH1 please the debators. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed . Thus, if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials apporiate for their age.     Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries. It's the parents who introducee the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on this debate would not be going on as it is.     The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years. Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice. @PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then thier will be no more books for any of us."

What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers."

I think we all can agree with @CAPS2. We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read.  I, however, believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults.  When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn.  Yes, they @MONTH1 choose another book and learn from it too but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read.Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.'  @CAPS2 is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver.  I have never seen @CAPS2 movie and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to.  @CAPS2 seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for @CAPS2 because what some do not want to learn from, others can.  I would never watch @CAPS2 or anything like @CAPS2 but my friends who have watched @CAPS2 have learned something. That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun.'  I kid you not, after hearing about @CAPS2 sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless. @CAPS2 brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, @CAPS2 video can not be on the internet.' none of my friends would have seen @CAPS2 or told me about it.  Therefore I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person.  Then, when I was older I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos. You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be.In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn.  We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool. If we all took away the materials that we felt were innappropriate or needed censorship then we would have very few learning materials left.  As Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'"

direction..But it just didn't up and build itself..To who it @MONTH1 concern:     @CAPS1 you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of liturature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries.     In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe.      Liturature can be described as art that an individual portrays it as in his/her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day. This means it has been there wars, politics, art and slavery. All of these are a part of liturature, so liturature is history in it's own way.     Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries. they might think that it should be removed from everywhere. It should not. It is a part of history. @CAPS1 you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at that certain time. It tells us what was happening in that part of the world. It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right. Many people thought is was right. They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs in return that they respect our's.     Liturature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldnt be where we were today. Liturature should stay in the shelves of libraries where they belong. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. @CAPS1 you want to be know for destroying an important part of history"

This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.     When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3.      Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.     When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.      If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again.     In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny. Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'"

What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the @LOCATION2 it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people. If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future.      When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for. Say a book on the asassination of @PERSON1 is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.           Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests @MONTH1 break out and rebelious citizens @MONTH1 protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.           The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell. @CAPS1 are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows. Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many @CAPS1. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents. The censorship @MONTH1 start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten.      Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were cencored, not only would  knowledge in the @LOCATION2 desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away"

In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might affend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is. However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelfs due to the feelings of another persons thoughts.     In @LOCATION1 over the years things have become more exceptable in media and books.  The rights have always been there but not fully practised. There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for there writings. For many years it went on until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perepective. Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded. In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they commited a murder.I do think there is a limit to how you distibute certain books and magazines. They shouldnt sell a book about death,poverty,or sex at a public school.      We all have diffrent things we like to read and write about. So why shoud we be taken away from because somone thinks its to offensive. I think not, if you dont like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it. With my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them , bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen. Thats just a easy way out of a situation. I have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do  bad things, no!      I know i cant speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc. or not harmful. But think about it like this wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace from it rather then go out and do what the character did in the story? Reading opens up new things and is scientificly proven to make you smarter in the long run. The more you read the more awareness and knowledge you gain ,and just becuase you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it. It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more."

I do agree that certain books are not approperiate for some children.  Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries?  Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can wright what we want on paper because it's what we want it's called freedom.  Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the approperate age groups.     Books are a great part of a students learning.  Parents need to learn, and understand no matter how much they don'@CAPS1 like it that they can'@CAPS1 protect their children from the world some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves.  How would childern and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual on @CAPS1.V.  If students never know how will they live.       Books can be learning in many ways.  Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child.  Maybe the family can'@CAPS1 afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books.  If students can'@CAPS1 have access to then whats the option for them?  Everyone knows how today's society is changing, if a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's they should be able to if the age is approprite.     All libraries check out books so the book is under a name.  I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out.  If schools had books that our for only a certain age group a soultion to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up.  So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get.  Books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by  parents."

holiday   We've got to get there in time to play      Tune up the fiddle, rosin the bow   We could be the only country band on A rock and roll show   We've got to get up, no time to hit up   There's another crowd waiting for the music to play      Slow down - come down   Don't take A ride on death's merry-Go-Round.Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon   And the anchors have been weighed   From Miami to Nassau   She's bound across the waves   She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay   Into the open sea   Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it   Now the many years she's been to sea   She's seen the better times   She gives a groan of protest   As they cast away her lines   And the grumble of her engines   And the rust along her spine   Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'   But the sands run out within her heart   A tiny spark glows red   It smolders through the evening   There's laughter overhead   Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt   And the drinks are passed around   Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'   Now it's midnight on the open sea   And the moon is shinin' bright   Some people join the party   And others say goodnight   There's many who are sleepin' now   It's been a busy day   And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'   ""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning   Let someone understand""   But her silent plea is wasted   In the playin' of the band   Everybody's dancin' on her deck   And they're havin' such a time   And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""   Deep within the Yarmouth Castle   The fire begins to glow   It leaps into the hallways   And climbs and twists and grows   And the paint she wore to keep her young   Oh Lord, how well it burns   And soon that old fire is a-ragin'   Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast   The captain stands aloft   He calls up to the boatswain, says   ""Boatswain, we are lost""   For the ragged hoses in the racks   No pressure do they hold   And the people down below will soon be dyin'   All amidships, oh she's blazin' now   It's spreadin' fore and aft   The people are a-scramblin'   As the fire blocks their path   The evil smoke surrounds them   And they're fallin' in their tracks   And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'   Oh then the ship, Bahama Star   Comes steamin' through the night   She sees the Castle blazin'   And 'tis a terrible sight   ""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries   ""We'll save you if we can""   Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'   ""God help the ones who sleep below   And cannot find the way   Thank God for those we rescue   Upon this awful day""   Now the heroes, they are many   But the times are growin' slim   And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'   Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'   She's cryin' like a child   You can hear her if you listen   Above the roar so wild   Is she cryin' for the ones who lie   Within her molten sides?.Had to think I had heaven right here in my hand   And oh, just let it slip away like sand..I've heard it said that the thrill of romance   Could be like a heavenly dream   And I'll go to bed with the prayer   That you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems      Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears   Then whisper sweet little things in my ear   Hugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing   Lover man, oh, where can you be?.That's all I know   now..Oh my darling I sure loved that meal   Though I could still taste the pig squeal   Now I'm weak and losing focus   I think you gave me trichinosis   Trichinosis is little worms that dig   And

If you want it   Come and get it.Censorship in libraries? In my opinion I don't really care if books, movies, or magazines are censored. I'm not a person that does much reading but I do know of some books, magazines, and movies that are filled with perfanity. In my opinion that is just the authors way of how he or she wanted to do it.      I believe that libraries should keep these type of materials on the shelves but have them in sections maybe. Taking them off the shelves would be disrespectful to the authors/producers. That is their work and they took the time to do it for our entertainment! Maybe you really dislike all the cursing in books and magazines and want them gone...Well listen, there are heeps and heeps of books out there you can find that are not bad!      If you are more of the movie type of person but also do not like the cursing or nudity, there are plenty of movies out there that are very innocent! I hate when I sit down to watch a movie with the family and then all of sudden the actors start throwing around the @CAPS1 word and half naked women appear. But if we would simply read about the movie on the back of the case or ask about it then we would know to choose a different movie. One that is more family oriented and safe for children eyes.     So just because there are some materials that are out there with all sorts of fowl language and indecent human behaviors doesn't mean you should ban them from the libraries. If some people want to fill their mind with filth, let them. But for you who do not, get other stuff. Simply try telling other people about better books they can read and nicer movies to watch. Be a role modle and teach them about healthier viewings"

For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advandages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. @CAPS6 many books would be gone?     If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person @MONTH1 find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that '@CAPS1' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public. @CAPS6 would we get as much knowledge as we have?     Without all the books that are in our libraries @CAPS6 would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn @CAPS6 to do things. I myself have learned @CAPS6 to become a successful @CAPS2 novel @CAPS3 from the @CAPS4 I took out of 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4 for @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries?     Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be createative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books?     Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropraite but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different park of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want cenorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books."

source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated,      ' All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.     The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.      Another  important reason why library censhorship is wrong is that material that one person @MONTH1 find to be offensive @MONTH1 not be ofensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of      @CAPS1, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories  or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people @MONTH1 be able to look back on these events both now and in the future.        In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrigh the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content.

What's behind those big brown eyes   Do you dream at night   Without your lullaby      Little boy sits alone as he sings in the dark   Wondering if his own dreams had pulled them apart   He sings a song of tomorrow he never can see   Mostly sings of a lost little girl's memory   And now...      As his dreams go flashing by   He begins to hear   A lonely lullaby      Well now...   We used to sing   And we used to cry   Through everything   In our children's lullaby      Little girl on the street with nobody around   Has her head in the air dirty feet on the ground   She shuts her eyes and wonders if this is a mistake   Now she's gone from the warmth of her little boy days   And still...      She believes that she'll get by   On her own without   Her little boy's lullaby      Little boy prays to God to answer his song   To hold her hand when everyone else's are gone   Time goes by and the wounds slowly turn into scars   So he makes his final wish on the midnight stars   And he screams...

If so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it? I know in my experiences I have found some things that were offensive, so I am sure that they are out there. I think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone.      If you were in a children's library or a school library, I am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc. should be removed from the shelves. Now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable. The audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. Part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it.     In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. @CAPS1 is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read.     As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is why I think there should be guidelines or rules. If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. Different things are offensive to different people. If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future.     I think there should be censorship in libraries. Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'"

There are manny ways people can exspress them self in todays world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people exspress them self. Because all of us are different and have our different veiws on the subjuct. Im not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong. im just going to share a few prior exspereances. Now all of theas were from being in a libraries. Some of them in smaller towns, others in the hart of a larger city. There is evean a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city. It is also amazing to see what is exsepted in differeant parts of our country.      Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 librarie. It was a small groupe of friends and we were all working on our reaserch papers. But we then saw a man and a woman, what I proseaved as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly infront of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazin she looked over to him and proclamed, that is so derogitory against woman. So he put it down and walked out. Wandering what was so bad about this magazin I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underware with a classic car. About a mounth later I was walking in my local librare droping off some books for my mom. Instantly when opening the door I hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section. Wich was of a woman with her chest exsposed, now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly  pealing off. Now that painting was there for manny years with out any one saying any thing and that was the argument made by the head librarean. There were manny people standing in the area that this was taking place, and manny of them were not evean willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could reamber.      As you can see there are manny differant veiws on what is exsepted in the modern time. Advertizement is all over and manny magazines use peoples bodys to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product. I belive there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of addvertzing. They @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that. if they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pic that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that. altho when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were yong too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall. There is a fine line when it comes to the information being exseptible or not that is why I do belive there should be some kind of rating system whith the book and etc"
"That's why I know I'd rather believe in You..What do I do now?.Talk to the people, but they just don't listen..I need you..When love comes so late, it'll really hit hard   It slams through the gate, it'll catch you off guard   Everyone said, ""What a perfect love match   'Cause she is so smart, she's a hell of a catch""      I was drinking in love, gulping it down   Drifting for months on a billowing cloud   But after awhile I stopped to rebel   I'm back in the past and I'm raising up hell      But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life   And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life      We'd been living together for over a year   The harmony's perfect, it rang loud and clear   But then very slowly, my nerves start to fray   The little things big, that's what they say      I acted impatient, I acted unkind   I took her for granted, I played with her mind   She didn't deserve it but it was too late   I walked out the door and left her to her fate      But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life   And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life      (Whoo Whoo Whoo...)

4x].Is nothing sacred anymore?.@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4.      Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4. And yes, We all know that most people these days don't usually share.      To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want. Either get over @CAPS4.      Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion.     We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree.      Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2.'      No, I do not believe that books,music, and etc. should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6!?     I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book. I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music.     Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing . So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1. '@CAPS7 life'     @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager.     So basically I'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying.     You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree"

in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them"

Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so. These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library.          People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching.           Genre comes in all kind of different types. For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only. Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand.     All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section.          All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media"

Just because some one @MONTH1 finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are.     I feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to. No one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read. Every one has the choice. To choose what they want to read or watch.      what one person @MONTH1 find offensive and wrang. Another person. @MONTH1 find interesting and exiting. I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf. The next person after me. Has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have. To like or hate what ever is on the shelves.     There are lots of things in a @CAPS5. Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive. There are scary books like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON2. There are mistury books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON1.     So to some up my esay. Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves. Just because i or any one else finds them offensive"

You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They @MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of."

I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up.      I'm a @CAPS2. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things. And its something that would have to be done.      Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing.  I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others"

I believe that the answer to that question should be no, because everyone in the world could find something in a library that could be considered obscene or offensice. However, if a library decides to remove every  piece of literature or art in its possession that someone finds offensive, the walls and shelves of its core would be bare.          I'm sure you have seen and heard many people who have been offended by silly things such as children's novels, pictures in magazines, and song lyrics. I know I have seen people who have become livid because of how offeneded a piece of literature or art has made them. But with seeing such reactions, I've come to the conclusion that what someone @MONTH1 find offensive, another person could find beautiful. For example, paintings of nude men and women are looked at as wrong and disturbing by some and are also seen as masterpieces by others. Everyone has their own opinions about things but it's not the library's job to worry about which opinions are wrong or right.           There is really no way to avoid offending someone without completely clearing the walls and shelves of a library. Simply anything could be seen as offensive to anyone. I know that I've personally found some books on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be disturbing because of how graffic they are. However, that doesn't mean other people shouldn't be able to read something a young woman found offensive. Offensive pieces of literature and art are often the best kinds because they evoke emotions in people, although maybe not the intened emotions, and make people think. You learn a lot when you're looking at something that has put strong emotions into you.       With everthing going on in our society and culure today, in the @LOCATION1 and around the world, someone is bound to be offened everyday by something. Religious groups @MONTH1 be offened by the way a cover of a book is drawn or the pictures in a teen magazine and politcal leaders @MONTH1 be offended by what journalists are writing about them. You see, there is simply no way to avoid offending people. To me, it's truly surprising that libraries are still worrying about censorship when television shows are showing sex, drugs, and violence. People are obviously getting offened by what television shows are airing but, see, that's just it. The television shows are still being aired. Offensive or not, people are still watching, just as people are still reading books, looking at pictures, listening to music, that someone, at some point, has found offenseive.      If a library decides to take out every offensive piece of literature and art what would be left? My friends, the answer is nothing. A beautiful creation to you @MONTH1 bring back horrific memories to someone else but that doesn't make it a bad creation. A novel that makes your stomach turn in knots @MONTH1 teach you more than you've ever learned before in your whole entire life. I hope people realize that just because something is offensive to someone doesn't make it wrong. Just because someone decided that they thought a piece of literature or art was not what they wanted to see or read doesn't give them the right to deprive someone else of the chance to read or see it.  As you can clearly see, libraries shouldn't waste their time on censorship, because no matter how hard you try, someone will find something that bothers them."

deeds that rang our youthful dreams   It seems shall go undone   North for the shores of Valinor   Our bows and crimson sails were made   Our captains were strong, our lances long   And our liege the holy king      The hills did turn from green to blue   And vanish as on the decks we watched   But every thought in that noble company   Was forward bound   To the lifeless plains of Valinor   Where reigns the dark and frozen one   And with tongues afire and glorious eyes   We pledged our mission be      The clime from mild to bitter ran   The wind from fair to fierce did blow   Oath and prayer did turn to thoughts   Of homes left far behind   Longed every man for some glimpse of land   And the host that did await us there   But each new day brought only a sea   And sky of ice and gray      Thanks give no word can drag you through   Those endless weeks our ships did roll   Thanks give you cannot see those sails   And faces bleach and draw   Ice we drank and leather did chew   For the oceans are unwholesome there   The dead that slid into the seas   Did freeze before our eyes      Then a wind did fling the ships apart   Each one to go her separate way   The sky did howl, the hull did groan   For how long I do not know   And what men were left when the winds had ceased   Grew dull and low of countenance   For soldiers denied their battle plain   On comrades soon must turn      So one by one we died alone   Some by hunger, some by steel   Bodies froze where they did fall   Their souls unsanctified   Until only another and I were left   Then just before his flame did fail   We shone ourselves brothers-in-arms   To serve the holy king      Perhaps this shall reach Andilar   Although I know not how it can   For once again he's hurled his wind   Upon the silver prow   But if it should my words are these   Arise young men fine ships to build   And set them north for Valinor   'neath standards proud as fire.'Cause I got crabs,   I got crabs,   I got crabs,   I got those

should not look at. It can be offensive. I believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work. I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at.     My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book. I feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not. Censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read.     I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person. I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible.     I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book. If it offends them then they should not read the book, and choose another book. Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process.      My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriete to someone. My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday. But as of right now I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries"

feel the calm when the problem's all gone   And then you start to see another piece   Of yourself that you can't let be   Memories of the last fight to free yourself   Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well   And now you know that you can choose   To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise   You can live if you're willing to   Put a stop to just what's killing you   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me   I feel it everyday, I feel I made my way   I feel it swell up inside   Swell up inside, swallowing me   Alive in me, inside of me   A part of me screams away silently   Alive

to. I read world war @CAPS1 books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it.     I think they should age books like this book is for ages @NUM1, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines."

Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi. Everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore.     @PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. @PERSON1 is the reason why there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics. Books SHOULD @CAPS3 be censored at all. It hides the authors thoughts, idea, and meanings behind their writing.     I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in. Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books.     Pre-@CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and menatally. Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones. It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false.     My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read. I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine; yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it. A skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life."

Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts @MONTH1 be offensive to a select few in our @CAPS2. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public.      Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect @CAPS2. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real @CAPS2' and one of the greatest ways to abtain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' @CAPS2.      Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The @CAPS1, @LOCATION1's genocide, and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. However, history is an important factor in everyones lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconcepted views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.'     As people develop their own opinions and views overtime they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. Your rights @MONTH1 be someone else's wrongs. What @MONTH1 be offensive to you, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the @CAPS2 goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions, censorship destroys our ability to do so.      Everyone is different. The @CAPS2 is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our @CAPS2 becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful @CAPS2. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmul to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do"

These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?"

Librarian's shouldnt have bad stuff on the shelves at libraries if it is offensive to some people. Libraries should only have interesting books with good story's to read and kid books. There should be no sexual or racial book's, movies, magazines, etc.     Those thing's that are found offensive should be taken off the shelf because there are little kids that go to the library and they should'nt be able to see those thing's or check them out. I do agree that library's should have a wide range of different kind of book's, and movies, etc because everybody has there own taste in what they like. But the thing's that are offensive should'nt be on the shelve's.     If library's didnt have offensive thing's on the shelf then nobody would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it would'nt cause any problems with people because they would'nt be on the shelf. So if they would just take those thing's off the shelf then nobody would see them and there would be no problem's at the libraries. Adults and kids could go to the library and pick out what they wanted without seeing the offensive thing's on the shelves which would make it a much better place to enjoy."

Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this. A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents @MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents @MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also @MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents @MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @MONTH1 be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people @MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.     Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, @NUM1's, and burned onto @CAPS1, there's no removing it. Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person @MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?"

I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.

taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people @MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody.     Think of some authors that wrote books like @PERSON1, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now.     Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature.     People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news."

They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spollied. they want every little thing in the world and the parants are buying it for them to make them happy.     The parants are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated @CAPS1 movies or get a rated @CAPS2 video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parants and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parants.     When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parants what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parants that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard.       I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it ment but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was preaty sure they didn't tell there parants because the one how told there parants got hit still woundering what it ment still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it ment i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again.     Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parants or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine beacuse it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this 'what you decide people will be against it no matter what'"

Maybe, but @CAPS2 all depends on who you are and @CAPS1 angers you. Somepeople think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but @CAPS2 can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries.     From @CAPS1 I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is '@CAPS1 gets them so angry?' @CAPS2 is different for somepeople than others. For example, a @ORGANIZATION1 fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. others can get mad at a movie because @CAPS2 discriminates races of other kinds. Like how in the @NUM1's, some movies characterized @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. In my view, actually being @CAPS3 @CAPS6 myself, sort of aggrivates me too, but none the less, shouldnt argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech.     @CAPS2 depends on how @CAPS2 angers them also, like how back in world war @NUM2, the @CAPS7 people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @CAPS8. That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldnt worry about @CAPS2, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read @CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if @CAPS2 is truly offrnsive to people in general, not just you.      Then after that the main question we would ask would be '@CAPS1 should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library @CAPS2 came from and ask them to read @CAPS2, and if they think @CAPS2 is offensive, then they would more than likely take @CAPS2 off the shelfs. Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, dont tell the library, thats just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read @CAPS2. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination, but not over a sports team.     So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending. Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons, not silly one"

magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover, or any offensive mind grabbing, sexal contact in any of the  story, music, etc. Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitten around, the radio for example, the music that they put on like rap, hip-hop with all the cusin and singing about mony, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio, and adalt books that are sitten around in @ORGANIZATION1 ready to be read by adalts, not children.The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day just not when there @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old looking at pornograghic magazines, and movies. So I hope you keep this in mind get that stuff off the streets and not into childrens hands."

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself?      Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note.      I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.         What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught.     Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall.  Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music"

When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes. I wonder how do people come up with these ideas.The real reason is why people listen to music, read books watch movies are so offensive. In todays world you got music with all this negative stuff about people, talkin about people, with the curse words its not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to the music. I feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed. Parents dont want there little children hearing that negative music. When they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else.     I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves. The reason i say is because movies are funny, scary, sad etc.Sometimes u need the offensive in a movie, with out that it would not be good most of the time. One of my favorite is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and it was about character from the past @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 get back together and do one more mission. That movie was offensive but u still have a good time watchin it because its has the nice cars and good character. Movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun.People can not go to the movies with there friends and have a good time.If u are taking little kids out make sure u pick the right movies for them.To conclude argument Music is not bad thing to listen cause u have good music to but all im saying is make sure to watch what u listen to and get in trouble trying to do what they say in there music.To the movies keep comming out with good movies and keep making the movies good"

Books, music, magazines, movies, commericals. Is it right to have all types of @CAPS1 shown to all ages? I disagree. A variety of people could take offense to the content this @CAPS1 contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming @CAPS1 should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home.      Even though some people @MONTH1 not take offense to any type of @CAPS1, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this @CAPS1 brings. Some content @MONTH1 not be suitable to younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements.      Religion. Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the @CAPS1 contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree.      A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended.      @CAPS1 can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners.

Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it.     Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read?      Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing ,and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem.     I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society. There are many people who @MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity?"

Some people @MONTH1 think any books with god or jesus in the are offensive but that @MONTH1 just be because it is not there religion. If every person took off a book that they thought was offensive  there would be no books left. Because people think differently. Or some @MONTH1 not like the @PERSON1 books because of the violence and goryness but to some people those are there favorite books, so that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others dont. There are many books out there that not everybodys gonna like the difference is how you think and what you think is right and wrong"

Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries?     Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people @MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself.           People of different races and cultures @MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout. Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue @MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.      Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries. What will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.      Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us"

some place I'd never ever been   And then in came a cake all decorated in my name   With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name   The clock was passing out from time to time   I saw it all at the beginning of the ending of my first levity ball.All you slingers and fiends   Hide behind your rocks   Put down your guard   I'm not here to box   This is no showdown   So throw down

beeper?).This is my prayer, my humble plea,   May the Lord be ever with me..In my way of viewing things i say that what i think is that the book, movies, music, and magazines should be put in critical order because some of us want or like to read or see stuff about what we want to see like the news that are in one way good to us, but some others like to see what's behind from the reality and want to speak up but they can because they are afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up. So i think that those things(books, music, movies, magazines) should not be removed from the shelfs because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that i have is music i had once heard a song in spanish called '@CAPS1 The @CAPS2' and it talks about the corruption in @LOCATION1 and that how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top do not care about them, also if you treat them as kings they will treat you as a slaves, and that if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you, they will take out advantage of it, how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but its not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for them... its a very good song that says the true about it and that nobody does something to finished.So i don't want that songs or books that show the reality disapper because some people doesn't like them at all"

for all my life   I'll be always on your side   In the shadow, in the light      I'll follow you, wherever life goes   But I'll always be aside   In the shadow, in the light      But if we don't

I promise you, even when the tide is high   I'll be always on your side   In the shadow, in the light.He said, ""I'll take a run there, if I have nothing on."".I can ??.She sits alone,   In the abandon't corner, of her room, (oh her room)   Lost her life, her lovely past, ooo ooo ooo ooo   She used to love, feel and have compation,   But now Her life has lead nowhere, nowhere(hold 4 count)   (Chorus)   She feels attached,   And can't come loose,   Like strings holding on,   She can't let go,   She begs and pleads,   As she tries to relase,   And falls to her knees (hold 4 counts)      What's holding her back?.Blowing my mind..Getting over all the time I had to worry,   Leaving all the changes far from far behind..We have nothing to give   That didn't first come from Your hands   We have nothing to offer You   Which You did not provide   Every good, perfect gift comes from   Your kind and gracious heart   And all we do is give back to You   What always has been Yours   Lord, we're breathing the breath   That You gave us to breathe   To worship You, to worship You   And we're singing these songs   With the very same breath   To worship You, to worship You   Who has given to You   That it should be paid back to him?.A crack in the smile   But she's always in style while she waits   Waving goodbye but she's too tired to cry and she's wasted   A letter he wrote   But it's far too expose so he throws it away   The sound of regret as it's counting the steps back to safe      [Chorus]   I don't want to leave you with perfume and promises   But we'll never know 'till we capture and bottle it   'Cause wouldn't it be such a shame   If all was wasted      Not an inch of the room   That isn't in bloom or in light   So we drink 'till its dawn   Every drip 'till it's gone and we're wasted   It's a thing of the truth   But we'll lie and we'll look for the perfect escape   And the moment will go like melted snow in the rain      [Chorus]      Stay for another morning   Study the curves on my face   Stay even when we're unknowing   Stay 'till they tear you away      [Chorus].La-la-la, la-la-la,   La-la-la-la-la-la-la!.I'm sorry I don't feel the same..I was hot for you..Unrivaled, unruffled I'm beauty unleashed   (Yeah)   Jaws drop, hearts stop, so classic and classy   We're not talkin' Lassie   La, ah, ooh, aroo   Ruff, ruff ruff ruff ruff

By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person.      @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them.     Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the resonsibility to know the past and use it's lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self.     People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects dissappear for another person?      In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the concequencies of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day.     In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is resonsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions"

I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right"

might be taken to others as something they value. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is.                                                Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect with books in a way that others @MONTH1 not understand. Taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. They use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless. People love movies. It helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive. But, it's not up to anybody else. Magazines help people keep up with news. Most of the news can be very offensive. It is the people around you causing the offensive news. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news.                                          Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way. Everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel?"

There are lots of stuff in book that people @MONTH1 think is offensive. Some other people @MONTH1 think differently. I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways.     I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library. They see stuff that's around them. they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library.     In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing. Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs.     I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world that it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they coudn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library.     We shoudn't take books offensive. After all they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library. Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly."

fingers   And see with my eyes      In the hearts of the children   A pure love still grows   Like a bright star in Heaven   That lights our way home      Like the flower that shattered the stone   A sparrow finds freedom   Beholding the sun   In the infinite beauty      We're all joined in one   I reach out before me   And look to the sky   Did I hear someone whisper      Did something pass by   As the river runs freely   The mountain does rise   Let me touch with my fingers      And see with my eyes   In the hearts of the children   A pure love still grows   Like a bright star in Heaven      That lights our way home   Like the flower that shattered the stone   Like a bright star in Heaven   That lights our way home      Like the flower that shattered the stone.So call me Simba little mama

I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are a place for learning and work. If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward.      Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously.    If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries.      How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes. If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such."

I think thats the best thing for them to do when they dont have anything to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think that some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here but some of the things we learn are not very appropriate.      In high school just walking down the hall ways your going to learn alot of things you probably dont need to know yet but when you walk into  a library they dont need to encourage it by putting  books of drugs, alcohol, and sex on the shelves.       Books about drugs are alright to an extent.  If your reading about medicanes you can take and being in the doctors office and getting percriptions is alright but when you got books about pot, weed, crank, or meth thats a little much.  We need to learn about those drugs and what they could do to us if we use them or abuse them but we dont need to know how to roll a blunt or make meth.      Books about alcohol are the same way.  We need to know the dangers of drinking but we dont need to know about teen parties and things to do when your drunk.       Advertisements, magizines, etc., are the worst things for us kids because everyone of them have something to do with drugs, alcohol, or sex and trying to get us to do those thing in high school. The front cover of magizines always have people who have got caught with drugs who is dating or sleeping around with who and ik that we will and need to know these things but i dont think we need to read them out of books because then we read it and see how other people did it and we feel the need to do it or try it.     I believe these books that are over the line about alcohol, drugs, and sex need to be taking out of the librarys so that the kids have something to learn about and ask there parents about.  I have been in the librarys and I know for a fact that the first books I go for have one of those three invloved in it because those are interesting and we like reading about stories at parties or someone getting pregnant or an @ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and I think I want to go to a party they made them sound fun.     This is what I think about some of those books on the selves and what I think should happen.                                                                       Sinceraly,                                                            @LOCATION1"

government work here?.Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1.  Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.   These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever"

Repeat Chorus      Mikee, Donna, Regine:   What took you so long to make me cry....I need someones hand   To lead me through the night   Need someones arms   To hold and squeeze me tight   When the night begins   I'm at an end   'Cause I need your love so bad   Need some lips to feel next to mine   Need someone to stand up   And tell my when I'm lying   When the lights are low   And it's time to go   That's when I need your love so bad   So why don't you give it up   And bring it on home to me   Or write it on a piece of paper, baby   So it can be read to me   Tell me that you love me   Stop driving me mad   Because I need your love so bad   I need a soft voice   To talk to me at night   Don't won't to worry, baby   I know we'll make everything alright   Listen to my plea, yeah   Bring it to me   'Cause I need your love so bad   Because I need your love so bad.See my true reflection,   Cut off my own connections,   I can see life getting harder,   So sad is this sensation,   Reverse the situation,   I can't see it getting better..I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that itme and it should be removed from the library. The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers.     Some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my @CAPS1 used to let me do when I was a kid. If children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad. They could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside.      When I was ten years old, my family and I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. We were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night. We were fliping through the channels wating for the game to come on. We were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the televison that children's eyes shoudn't see. That occurance happened when I nor my parents wanted me to see it. That image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but childrens eyes can see it as well. Libraries should think of this when they are puting books and magazines on their shelves. They might be making a little bit of money but they are effecting a childs life in a negative way. Things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a childs book and what is an adult magazine. Children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside. This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries.     If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelve. The libray might not do it everytime, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children. If the library doesn't take the items off the shelve it could effect their business in a negative way. The library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for. The library shoudn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times. The library should listen to its customers that visit the library often.      I think that all offensive images to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library. The library should listen to its customers not only because it could effect their business, but becasue it could effect the lives of children in a positive or negative way."

Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions.     Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely. To keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @MONTH1 damage other people.     However this can also be argued. The people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library.           In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also."

Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive.     Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read. If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more. When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area.     The librarian's supervision is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, show them another book shelf. Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child @MONTH1 enjoy. But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child @MONTH1 be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting.     The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries. Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people @MONTH1 think is inappropriate for them to read, go to a different area.     Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain' then they should observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense"

take them to the library. While there, you see some advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far to inappropriate and offensive. What would you do?      Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, that you believe is offensive, you should say something. Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework, is just plain wrong.      What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what? So many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disasterous! I @MONTH1 not have children, but I do have younger cousins. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inapproproate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian.     Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who. For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards. One card is just to check out regular books. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older.      I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some @MONTH1 find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians desk. This way, noone who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need proof that they are eighteen or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials.     Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, ect., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction.      This is how it is at my neighboorhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions. If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them. Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials.      In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart. I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off. Thank you for taking the time to read this"

I believe that some materials in the libary should be taken off. Some people @MONTH1 find them offensive because they might have bad things in them. Some types of music have bad language in them and people dont want little kids finding them. If a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things. And they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it.     Alot of books are ok to read because they dont have bad things in them. some people like reading books that have drama and some people dont. Most books re ok to read. But some can have langauge in them and ahouldnt be aloud in the libary. But they can still be in there because some people might want to read them. If people dont want to read them then they shouldnt get them.     Some movies have bad stuff in there. That kind of stuff should not be in there because alot of people dont want to watch movies like that. And if a kid would walk in there and get one and if it had that stuff and the parent fount out then the libary could get sewed for having that stuff. So they should be taken out of the libary so people wont get them. The libary can keep children movies in there to watch because they are not bad.     If i worked at a libary then i would take magazines out. Sports magazines would be ok to keep in there. But alot of the others ones should not be there because they have alot of bad things in there and i wouldnt let people take them so i wouldnt have them in there. But sports and stuff would be ok because sports are not bad for people to read. People like reading about sports because it is interesting to read.     That is just what i thank. Other people might see it the other way and they can. People are different and they will thank different things. Some people might want to read that and some people dont. So it just shows you that people are different because they thank things different then other people do. And some libaries have that stuff and some dont. sp if you are one of those people that like that stuff then go to one of them that have that stuff. And if you are one of those people that dont then go to one that dont have that stuff so you can get what you want and they can get what they want"

That is like saying I get offened by homework, take it out of @ORGANIZATION2. Some of the most interesting books to read are about murders, I think. I belive they shouldn't be taken out or else no teenage kids would read in @ORGANIZATION1. Teenages like to have mystery and romance. I know that one of my favorite books, The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, would offend some people because it has murder in it. That certainly doesn't mean it was not a good and interesting book for me. They can just over look these books and pick another.     If you want to keep your @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 students interested you shouldn't take out book that might offend someone. By taking out some books not everyone would be happy. Some kids might not even read any more because you took the best books out of the library. Every book in one way or another would offend someone. They just need to overlook those books and read a diffrent one. I have seen some books at my @ORGANIZATION2 that offended me, but i did not tell the libraian to take it out of the @ORGANIZATION2. Another student might have loved to read that book.      Everyone has diffrent oppions so there would not be any books left if they took out all the offensive ones. The only books that would be left would be @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and children books. I do not know of any @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 student that would want to read @PERSON1 the @CAPS3 and give a speech about it in class. I'm not sure how the teachers could do book reports any more; all the books we read in class could offend someone. If everything that offened someone was taken out of the schoolt there would be nothing left of the @ORGANIZATION2. See everyone has a diffrent oppion on everything. That just isn't right.      In conclusion, books that offend someone shouldn't be taken out of schools and librarys. They keep the @ORGANIZATION2 students reading and growing. With out some of these books I myself wouln't like reading. So lets be mature aldults and keep all the books on the shelves and ignore the books that offend us"

Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, weither we take it away of not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of releaving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression.      Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hid such things from their children. this makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hid it, the more children will seek it out.     In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. it releaves stress, rage, and shows this so that @CAPS1 is a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagion someone truly angery in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will parish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' @CAPS1, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him.     In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story. allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie. It puts intrest into the material.     Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But, it applies foreshadowing, intrest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Something that intersts them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab promote and keep some within it"
"Mama?.Good golly, miss molly, sure like to ball..I just want this message understood..Yeah   Yeah yeah      I was looking for something   On the crime scene where you're in too deep   I found a note with his number   It's just another clue (that leads to you)      I got a little suspicious   I got a feeling that you ain't true to me   I should've known better   Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)      Yeah   You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see   that you're not for me babe      [Chorus]   No no, uh uh   Things will never be the same again with you   No no, uh uh   Now I know what it's comin' to   No no, uh uh   'cause' if you think that it's the way   That love should be   Let me tell you it's not for me      No no      I don't want to be part of your screenplay   Just tell me   Did you rehearse on me?.Oh what fun it is to ride,   In a one-horse open sleigh,   Hey!.Walk on, talk on,   Baby tell no lies..It's time, it's time, it's time, let's go!.It looked as if, it were taken in the forties sometime,   Judging by the style..You whispered, hurry..Dreams are shaking set sirens waking up tired eyes   With the light the memories all rush into his head..Ever since we met you've had a hold on me..You don't need a lover in this climate   You don't need a boyfriend in your bed   These days   Pull a blanket round you baby   If you're looking for an early grave   Mr. Anderton will lead you to it   He says   Pull a blanket 'round you baby   Some have said   I'd go now rather than wait   Just to sit and watch my days slip away   So surely   You don't need a lover in this climate   You don't need a boyfriend in your bed   These days   Pull a blanket 'round you babe.Now listen here, listen to me, don't you run away now   I am a friend, I'd really like to play with you..Hold tight   I want to dance with you this whole night   I hope the music never slows up   I hope this place don't never close up      Hold tight   Cause you're the only one who feels right   Girl I know it's now or never   I want to dance with you forever      So hold on tight, never let me go, baby   Cause I can feel the rhythm of your love   And when you get yourself in motion   Girl it's tearing my emotions right in two      Hold tight   And we will dance into the moonlight   All the stars they will surround us   We will be so glad we found us      So hold on tight, never let me go, baby   Cause I can feel the rhythm of your love   And when you get yourself in motion   I get loving notions all for you, yes I do      Hold tight   And we will dance into the moonlight   I hope the music never slows up   I hope tomorrow never shows up.I can't bare to face what's growing in my head..She turnin' on the radio,   She's shootin' up the stereo,   Puttin' on a video,   She's sayin' let's go let's go      Lisa won't marry me,   She says she's only four..Why don't you watch where you're wandering?.She only loves in stereo!.It's the american tradition   Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen   Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?.When the words pour down and the poetry comes,   And the novel's written, and the book is done..There comes a time in every life,   We find the heart we're waiting for..I'M COMING HOME, BABE!. Ok some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad like this one sports magazine i read talked about some atheletes and their accidents. like one article was talking about @PERSON1 playing basket ball and he had the stomach flu and he was having a hard time playing cause he had to use the bathroom alot.'I mean who would want to let the world know that they used the bathroom on themselves'. thats bad! And another thing why do libraries have books that have sexual things in them. Theres quiet a few books that are like that for an example theirs this book called 'wake' and its about a girl who gets pulled into other peoples dreams like there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual i thought wow why is this book in here. It also had alot of cursing in it i enjoyed it but i think it should be removed from the librarie. Cause theres kids that arent of age so they should'nt read them. i dont know thats all i have to say right now other then look at what your kids read theses days you might get upset"

This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie @MONTH1 be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see.  Life is about learnig new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere.  The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them.      If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even thought it is what many kids are reading about today.  Of coarse, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics.  If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life.  Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life.  Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read.     Also, everyone today listens to music.  We find music as a way to relax and have a good time wheather your riding in a car or at a party.  Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them.  Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today.  What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life.     Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries.  Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete.  We watch movie to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while.  No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate.       I strongly believe that romoving any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on alot of people.  You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people.  How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed?  What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore"

There are many reason I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. THere are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below.      First and for most is the fact that this is @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is suposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least thats what the national anthem tells me. So to me if some one removes a book or movie from a library becasue they find it offencive they are trying to take away one of my right as an @CAPS1 cetacine. The right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book i wish. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf. If they put a movie or book away if they make it to were i can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is somthing i can't stand as an @CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to.     Which brings me to my next point. This point is a simple and logical one. My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. Just because it is there it does not meen that they have to read or watch it. If someone doesn't like a book good for them don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie good for them don't watch it. It is rather quit simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everone else. Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offencive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. There @MONTH1 five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy. They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say i can't.     Finaly people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not apropreat for children. Well to that I have to say it is the parents job to make sure a child is not readind or watching something they shouldn't. If i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completly remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it.      So there is my opinion on this little matter. I don't feel that libraries should be censored. I feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose. It is not fair to get ride of a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of othes might love it, and like I said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it. Don't ruin it for everyone else though."

days you see viloence in evry store around the world. Children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output. Alot of the kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there.               I think that the offensive thing's should be taken off the shelves. And sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores were it allows young teenagers to buy those products , then we are just puting ourselfs at harm. I was just in a book store the other day and i seen magazines that were not apporiate. I thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines. Music , movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store , that's why its called a book store.                It's not called a movie, music , or magazine store they call it a book store for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive they are going to grow up thinking it's ok. Too be that way or treat somebody different because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store just take the offensive one's and have a twenty one or older sign. So the kids dont end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't.               When i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. Alot of the time my mom would take the book from me. Because it was offensive, i didn't know that at the time i was just a little kid. In today's society kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and thats not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books.               I guess it does'nt really matter for middle school and high school kids. Because those kids really dont like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for is the one's in elementary. Because those kid's actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it. And those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you.               In the end it does'nt really matter what i say because people are going to keep making books. Anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make. It does'nt matter if it is negative or a possitive book. the company wants to make money and so does the author."

materiales in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay more attention to what they are doing. If parents monitor their children closer they will be able to control what they are doing. There are alot of bad things for children to read, look at, and listen too out there. Parents need to do a better job teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen too.     It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are looking for something inappropriate. It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad. Most of the time in a library the more profound books and magazines are seperated from the childrens books. This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries. In all of the times i have been to a library i have never accedentally come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages it should not be limited to just one age group.     If libraries were censored more people would be upset. It would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it. Alot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored. The library would then become a place for mostly children. Most small children do not even go to the library so they would become virtually useless.     In all of my years I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library. Weather it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouf, I have never seen a complaint. Most parents do a good job of monitering what the children look at or read. Those parents should not be deprived of their privelages to look at more adult rated things if they choose. Just because one parent was to irresponsible to moniter their child does not mean that all of the parents should be punished.     The library is a place for people of all ages. Therefor the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottomline is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things they should keep a better watch over them. They should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable."

A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy.                 A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think.  Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves.  Take an author like @PERSON1 for example.  His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people.  That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like @PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized.                  The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality."

Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to"

In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle?     Everyone in this world is entitaled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people @MONTH1 be right to others. For example, one family @MONTH1 view their children using curse words as offensive while another @MONTH1 see no problem. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence disscused in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear.     It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability so see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspecitves does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the aknowledgement of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored.     In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion."

fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy. Writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams. Being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations. Every reader seeks out a different style.          Libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind. Books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options. The necessity for censorship should never be an option. Writers compose for all sorts of people. For some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an @CAPS1 @NUM1 cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. Taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical.          Whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. If the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in affect. Resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options. To each, its own."

many things today that have censorship,but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out.     I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,@CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment.     If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1.     Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older.     So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people"

The material should be removed if they offend their gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race.     The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text.     Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrostist from this offensive content.     The material also should be removed if it is offending someones race. First, the material @MONTH1 call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's very offensive name( not directly but in general). Second the material can speak of the race as if was bad. Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race.     The material that is offensive to anyones gender,religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. the library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting not to offend other people in all ways."

My opinion on this is no. In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions. I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day.       In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc. @MONTH1 offend any race or a sertain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the @LOCATION1. Some @MONTH1 be very offensive but it only shows a past, others @MONTH1 just be plain out racist or sexist. Those that show the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 history are an education sorce so we can learn from mistakes. Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someones freedom of speach away. I hate when I here music that disrespects women but im not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family @MONTH1 have been.     In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something tody might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated. I hope i caught attention and changed some opinions because alot of offence today has resulted from the past"

that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive.  If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves.  Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @MONTH1 not teach them.  If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote.  If certian literature were not around anymore then it definitly would not be the same as it is now.  Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if if one @CAPS1 was taken away, it would start a riot.     Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality.  Imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society.  If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything.  Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society.  Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.'  Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart.     Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking?  Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers.  They have problems just life people of the real world even though they @MONTH1 not be real themsleves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about there problem.  Important history books of movies could be taken away becaus it 'offends' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to have students learn about slaves.     If one @CAPS1 was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society.  What good does that do anyone?  It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about.  It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of aproppriateness.  If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now.  No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.     Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down.  If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries.  They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe.  Information of any kind is a good @CAPS1 no matter the content of it.  So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea."

Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent.     As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store. Parents bring their children to the @CAPS1 to support their reading ability and to advance it. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad.      A few years back, I herd about a teenage boy that would go into the @CAPS1 about once a week to look for movies that this parnents would not approve of. Later on that boy was caught and punished. If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it. Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it. Parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the @CAPS1. This problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue.      I strongly believe that @CAPS1 material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. Form what I have seen, someone @MONTH1 want, for example, a book about @CAPS2 taken off the shelf because they are @CAPS3 and might not support their religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion.     Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone likes to sit in the @CAPS1 for hours and soak in a good novel. Material that is found offensive does not belong their, unless it is for real educational learning."

Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of it's rating or the content in it is inapropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I.      I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultry. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age.      These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them, grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times.      When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' by @PERSON1. This book was a fictional story taking place during the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out.     That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it.      From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over @NUM1, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it @MONTH1 be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc.     In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion.Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imparative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is."

Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic.     In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are puble areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions.     A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing. By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1. This is a quick and easy fix.      There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly"

It's a big deal not only because of how it will affect my children, but because it will affect me and what everybody else will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an importaint issue but to what extent should it be taken. People should have the right to read what they want to. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries.     My veiw on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on the book shelf. I can understand censorship to an extent, but taking books out of a public libraries makes it hard to chose where to draw the line. You don't want a book taken out just because it has a bad word in it. Just because some books are classics that everyone knows, does that mean that we shouldn't take that book out of a public library? I do beleive that some books should stay because adults don't want to be reading kids books they most likely want to be reading a more complex book.      I think their are some books that should stay out of the library though. A example is books that are extremly racist. These books should be kept far away from are children. This is needed because younger children might try to act out things they might hear or read because there are audio books and those would just make them say those things. This could cause them to get in trouble for things they don't understand yet.     There is things that you can do as an alterative to keep these things out of the hands of children. There is already one that is used in public libraries and it is seperateing the adutl books from the children books. You could also move these two sections to oppisite sides of the library. the books that are more explicit cold be put higher up such as on a top shelf. Most kids would not be able to reach as high as a adult.     These are my veiws and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and veiws that I have are most likely different than most people. I thought that they were good ideas though. Ones such as seperate section for kids and adults. I thought my best one was puting the more explicit books up higher and moving the sections farther a part."

We have the freedom to @ORGANIZATION1 the way we feel or think, but can it be to graphic for some to read? I believe censorship in libraries are needed to protect the minds of children and people who are easily influenced by the thoughts of others.     Books are a major factor in expressing the way one feels about a topic from romance to horror. Many children like to read books or comic books that invovle a great deal of violence. Childrens mind's are like sponges, which means they soke up anything they read about and it has a great chance at influencing their functioning to everyday activities.      If you go into a music store you will find many different types of music from rap to blue grass. I've noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 has been known for rapping about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do all this why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs by @ORGANIZATION2 and in every song one of those four key topics comes up.      Like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 the movie industry is starting to come out with more and more movies about drugs, sex, money, and violence. Many students in my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS1', '@CAPS2' ect. and how they turned their life into something like those movies when they go on @DATE1 or @DATE2 break. Movies like those are funny to watch but for someone who is easily influenced shouldn't be watching them.     Books, music, movies, and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts of another human being. We do have the freedom and the right to @ORGANIZATION1 ourselves but we also have the right to take it away if we feel it is endangering the minds of others. I think censorship in a library from certain things is a good option in cleaning up a mind poisoning mess"

How about music, or magazines?  I sure don't.  I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read.  If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.       I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book.  A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time.  They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time.  Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down.  I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.     Music on the other hand could be thought of as different.  Many people could take music in the wrong way.  A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap.  Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language.  I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them.  Music can also be on the good side too.  When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax.  Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.     Then you have magazines.  Personally I think they are the worst of all.  Magazines tend to go one way or the other.  They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them.  One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story.  In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about.  Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.       In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library.  There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side.  Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it.  With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music.  Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy.  There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way.  I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement."

Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored materials. I like getting the full effect out of things. I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see that word and feel its full effect.          I am actually reading the very controversial book '@CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'. As you @MONTH1 know the author of this book is named @PERSON1. Another thing you @MONTH1 know is the use of the '@CAPS2-word'. This is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the '@CAPS2-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think this is very racist. But back in @LOCATION1's time it was very commonly said and used in his society. It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. I have to disagree though. I understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south.     People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? Just a thought. Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their freedom to do whatever they want."

book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information.     Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is.     If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen.     That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy.      In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to.There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand."

Somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowldge. If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music or inappropriate websites available to children it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning enviornment.      My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate. Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material. My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the @CAPS1 should be monitored. If someone wants to look up inappropraite images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material.     I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. However those @MONTH1 be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I, or those who don't have kids to look out for. Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. Yes, they @MONTH1 think that there is no real harm. But that @MONTH1 just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. With the magazines, some @MONTH1 argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? But if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten.      In some cases morality might not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. A lot of people are religious and their particular religion @MONTH1 be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents will not want to walk into a @CAPS1 with their children and find them starting at images that go against what they believe in. They will think of it as losing their child's innocense. Having these things out in the open and accessable to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not.     When I was a little girl I remember going to the @CAPS1 often with my mother to pick out books for school. I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section. My mother was appauled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. Ever since then my mom has been a little sceptical and dreads going to that @CAPS1. I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article.     I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. On the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform general public of these issues and to explain my side of the arguement. I don't see the reason of having these materials on hand at a @CAPS1 where almost anyone has access to them. I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a @CAPS1, or if there is a need at all. I'm hoping that by reading this I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time.          Sincerely, @PERSON1"

you, just because it had @CAPS1 language or nasty meaning? I mean of course there are certain books that should be censored, but in doing so you exclude @CAPS1 great novels from the past. These novels were acceptable back then. If you want to censor boks do so in your own library.     Personaly, I don't believe in the censorship of books. It the author meant to write the book that way then the writing should stay that exact way. Censoring destroys books and the learning curriculum of multiple students. You would censor a school book if it had @CAPS1 graphic text between its covers.     There are tons of books that have bad language and perverse ideas. These books were penned to educate our civilization. If you take away those books, then you will be harming our societies ability to learn. Books, I believe should not be offensive unless your a self-conscious person. Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be marred by censorships.      In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading a exquisit novel that has @CAPS1 minor graphic details. I do not care if there is a explicit word in my reading. Albeit, @CAPS1 neive persons have it in there will to remove offensive articles, not for public good, but for personal gain. These offensive tactics are a disgrace to literature and culture. @CAPS1 of the books writen in today's world are far less explicit then before. Thus, we would be creating that unwanted barrier.     When the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 burned the @CAPS4 books, we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature. This should never happen to today's literature. If we censor the books in our libraries, then we will be loosing a certain aspect of our culture. The censorship of the articles of reading in our libraries should be kept to personal libraries and only to personal libraries. The libraries are public for a reason.      In conclusion, Censorship should not be placed in libraries because it disrupts the public literature. If the books were meant to be read that way, then so be it. We are not the destroyer of classic literature, and it should never come to that."

dont like it and @CAPS1 people do. I am one of the people that like that kind of stuff, beacuse no one can tell us what we can and cant watch or say. It is our life if we wanna watch that kind of stuff or read about it we can.            Noone is telling people that they half to read it or even look at it. If you dont like it dont look at it. @CAPS2 kind of stuff should be off to the side where you know what your goin to look at and away from kids                       @CAPS2 shouldnt even be a problem. @CAPS2 is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag. That is there opinon.             In conclusion  I think if you dont read @CAPS2 stuff or watch @CAPS2 stuff you are trying to be something you are not. Trying to act better than every cause your to high class to read something like that.  We all get a laugh out of @CAPS2 kind of stuff."

Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or @MONTH1 come off as offensive.      A person should be able to read an article without feeling like somone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it.      People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person.      Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like @CAPS4 people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch '@CAPS3.' @CAPS4 people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable.      In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to"

books,music,magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own oppion on that question. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it.      Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growning up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life don't need to see. I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own?     You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and litsen to what you want. The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see. But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking quesions i'm going to answer with the truth.     Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself.     To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?"

I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves.  There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it.  Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves.       One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because what Katherine Paterson said in her quote.  She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf.  Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day.  Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library.       Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this.  As you know, there is many different cultural familes living in the @LOCATION1.  Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries.  Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing.  How would a library handle this situation.  If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries.  There would be a group of people walking in there and saying they don't believe in @CAPS1 so they must take those bibles off the shelf before their children read it.  Then, as soon as the believers in @CAPS1 hear about it.  They would come to that library and complain about them actually taking that off the shelves.  There would be no way in pleasing everyone, so the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves.       My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple people complain about certain books or movies.  Then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, or movie rental business, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve.  If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business and in my perspective.  The only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it and that is the owner.  It's their responsibility to know what's too far concerning movies or books, etc.  The public has to accept those choices.  You have to look at it from their view.  Would you want them to come into your business and start complaining and then you are forced to get rid of that item because of them.  It's just not the right way to handle things.     After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and you see that it just wouldn't be humane to do that.  It's never been that way and it should never be that way.  Obviously parents don't want their kids to see things inappropiate.  But it's not our say and we just have to face the fact that's the way it should be"

Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.    Let's take @LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.      When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.     There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.     So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it"

Say, maybe some sort of book that highly deals with drugs, alcohol or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to 'accidently' pick up this book and read it. It could scar them mentally for life.      Offensive books are not meant for kids or even some kids in the early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and/or sex. If a kid picks up a book about sex, which I highly doubt would be on a library shelf, what would they say to their parents? '@CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the kid would say and show the book to their parent. The parent, in shock, could sue the library for having such an offensive book.      However, some @CAPS2 do not find books like that on library shelves offensive. It might 'provide' good information for their lives or even someone else's life. @CAPS2 are the ones who should be reading those kinds of books, not their children. It can and will mentally scar them for life.       The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @CAPS2 and have the offensive movies/books/magazines, ect in there. Kids can't enter unless they are @NUM1 or older. That could be a good idea because their children wouldn't be picking up those kinds of offensive books and it will keep their mind safer.      Us children are always curious to know things, especially when we are growing up. We'll ask about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like that on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and other @CAPS2. The library staff should take action and make a separate room for @CAPS2 @CAPS3"

so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? This is a very controversial topic. On one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. They believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive. On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card.     I believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. If kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision.     As a teenager, I know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that.      Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the @PERSON1, and in order to find information about the topic, I had to check out books from the library. Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it. Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong. By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them.      People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. We are faced with choices everyday. Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do."

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from. But how many do you think is appropiate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose.          How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray.      I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done.   Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persausion. It @MONTH1 cause trouble but just set your mind to it and you can help and solve problems when you do set your mind to it"

If the reading material is so offensive towards you or your belifs, you @MONTH1 want to see a libarian and tell what you think about so that the reading material will be remove off the sevles and gone.     I think that if it goes against something in a bad way is should be removed and gone.  I've read a magazine before and it had some offensive stuff.  I went to the libarian, told her that i wanted this magazine off the shelves.  We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves.       Nobody wants something to go against them in anyway.  Thats way we should have offensive material off our libaries shelves."

I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch.  Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend.  Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong.     First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone.  I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today.  So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral.     Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored.  My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses.  If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves.  Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting.     Lastly, censorship is a communist trend.  Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy.  So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race.     So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere.  It is a very communist thing to do.  It infringes our rights.  Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored"

have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur."

I think that there is different levels of censorship that should be enforced depending on the library at which censorship is required.       In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor the books that are bought, and used in the library.  Seeing that elementary kids are not as mature as say an adult, or a high school student, their level of reading is not as advanced as ours.  Parents would definitely not want their children to be reading books that contain sex, drug usage, and any violence.  This is because reading these books might put ideas into their heads.  It @MONTH1 teach them things that they aren't supposed to do, and they @MONTH1 think that it is alright to act out on what they learn from a book.      On the other hand, high schoolers, such as myself, are interested in those kinds of books.  I am mature enough to know not to act out on what I read, and I am already aware of most of the things that books present.  While most guys are into violent books about shooting, or football books, a lot of girls are interested in the romance type of books, that possibly express more then what most kids should know.  In high schools, there should be less censory due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what we are interested in.       In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries do have already.  This way parents taking their children to the library will know in which way they should direct them.  Everyone is obligated to their own choices, whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive, is their choice.      All in all, I don't think that books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive, because books are a type of out let to people.  They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you preoccupied.  Books are everywhere, and people have every right to read whatever they please.  On the other hand, I think it is a great idea to censor books, and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children running into books they aren't supposed to, and to keep all of their parents happy!"

Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?      First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone.  Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writter and the followers of the writter. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems then just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone over all, rather than making it an issue to please one group but inturn upsetting another?      Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending other we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. For example a biology book might be offensive to people whos religion explains things differently and would make things untrue, and a religous document such as 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3' could be offensive to the people who believe the biology books to be true. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.      As a solution,  I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If that person is pleased then the first person is offended. If books could possibly labeled as'some might take offensive' or 'material @MONTH1 be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they can not put blame on the author or where ever they got the book because there was a warning. It would  be just like the parental warnings on cd's. This @MONTH1 not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.     In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an opition. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves @MONTH1 cause contraversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are preformed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves"

radio   Waitin' for my favorite songs   When they played I'd sing along   It made me smile   Those were such happy times and not so long ago   How I wondered where they'd gone   But they're back again just like a long lost friend   All the songs I loved so well   Every sha-la-la-la   Every wo-o-wo-o still shines   Every shing-a-ling-a-ling   That they're startin' to sing's so fine   When they get to the part   Where he's breakin' her heart   It can really make me cry just like before   It's yesterday once more   Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by   And the good times that I had   Makes today seem rather sad   So much has changed   It was songs of love that I would sing to then   And I'd memorize each word   Those old melodies still sound so good to me   As they melt the years away   Every sha-la-la-la   Every wo-o-wo-o still shines   Every shing-a-ling-a-ling   That they're startin' to sing's so fine   All my best memories   Come back clearly to me   Some can even make me cry just like before   It's yesterday once more   Every sha-la-la-la   Every wo-o-wo-o still shines   Every shing-a-ling-a-ling   That they're startin' to sing's so fine   Every sha-la-la-la   Every

Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways.      As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives.      The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared mevery much so.     Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library.     I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries."

I desagree too that this type of music that some artist are meading that they are tooking about drugs, gongs and narcotrafic and even sex and I know this because sometimes I heer this on the @CAPS1 and radio that they are sining and this influence to kids to have another directions on their life and us like parents we don't want that for our kids, don't want that fro their future, we want that they have a good future and be succefull and give them the same example to their kids to went they wrog up and  be a parent to and they are going to see what we are tooking about.I been seen it and parts of the world people been kill or people killing at other inocent persons for this type of things more for drugs that they are saling drugs and they are doing money that they are hurting to other people or kids that consume this drugs that maybe can be our kids or some friends kid and sometimes if they don't pay that money that they need to pay they kill them or that police are traying to faind them because are doing bad thinks and I hope that artist, or people that put this on the libraries think firts that maybe they are doing something wrong of steff that are thinking that are doing something good"

The question is, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' @CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them.     In my oponion, books should have a age limit on them. My reasoning is becuase, kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for thier age group. There are plently of books out there for all age groups. A kid under @NUM1, should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behivor from the character, or artist.      Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out, is becuase kids can get the wrong idea. Lets say, a book has a statment in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my bestfreind's house and drank alcohol.' @CAPS4 would be somthing that a child should not able able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing.     The age limits for book shelves should be as followed:@CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1-@CAPS6     @CAPS7 the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading. Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read. I really think that @CAPS7 books in @CAPS2 age groups, will stop the commotion.     Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1. With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' and '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' with be answered. Age groups on books, is a great idea."

their own rights to have what they want on their shilves.Yes you @MONTH1 say that some things are unapropriate for children to see but there is an children side of every libraryso that children would not have to see unapropriate things.I feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things.       Also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @LOCATION1 that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.I would also consider that @CAPS2, @CAPS1 dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.Everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be.     There are many other options,@CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child.When I was a young girl my mom never let mee go anywhere along so i never had to worry about seeing anything unapropriate or affensive.Now a days in @DATE1 children know right from wrong.Children know what they suppose to read and does not.       I do also agree if a librarian or an adult see or hear children looking or listening to something i they know they should not be,They should stop the child or converscate them from the premises.         So No i do not agree with you.I still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property."

younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media"

personal or professional it rather important. Some @MONTH1 find the material offensive to themself. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like that available to the younger generation. And writing or music could be thought of as unneccessary and irrelevant.     The world holds many things that can be found offensive to someone. That someone could be an educated person or a high school dropout. Out of all of the stuff in the world someone is going to find something offensive to them or other people. It can be a phrase that an author uses or the name of a song. But to take something away from the people is not right and shouldn't be allowed unless it is highly offensive. They could choose to stay away from that sort of thing. Unless the offender is very public and offends pratically everyone, should it then be removed.     Other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine then it should be removed because that would cause problems that could have never happened. People might learn how to do those things anyway but by allowing that to be public information would be like starting a fire that will get widely out of hand. Of course, anyone can get the notion to do something from anything they read but that is how they interpret it.     Some things out there are just inappropriate for the world and all the people on it. If you listen to a @CAPS2 and they singer or rapper starts using profanity and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone it would be unneccessary. Something like that should not be allowed in the first place and it is bad enough to be done to another singer but to talk about a race or culture in inexcusable. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, for example who just recently saved peoples lives, saying they were a horrible person and did terrible things to people when they only a little about the person and heard barely any of the story.     In conclusion, in certain instances the people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not just to them but to a large amount of people.Or if the material can cause problems that should not have started. And if the writing or music is inappropriate to a race or culture should it be removed. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music, and videos are putting them down they should have the right for it to be taken from access."

because alot of this stuff is on tv like comedy centreal, @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3,mtv and alot of channels.     should music be cenorship no because the blanks can ruin the beats, rythem, and the lyrics. The cenorship ruins how the song goes and it makes people mad because they like a certain song but if they want to listen to it they have to get on a computer. Websites they can get on to listen to it is @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and alot more.     Movies shouldn't ethier its the parents pick if they didnt want the kids to watch or hear the things they do dont pick it or tell the kids to go to their rooms.     Books!!! should not i repeat should not be cenorship because what if the adults want to read them. That aint fair for them cause all of this is a about kids. Kids are smart about this they know what to read and what they shouldn't read.     T.V. shows! is best thing ever their alot of shows thats funny,awesome,thriller,and alot more. But its gets to you. Here a example @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS3, and more plays alot of good movies but since they have block out the words and parts of movie it really dont make sense to watch it because their not parts they really haved seen and they have to go rent it or buy it. To see the movie. Am i right?     All i am saying the cenorship ruins alot of tv shows movies and music and nobody wants that. It's ruins the enteriment for people and that sad to see cause actors, music writers, writers, and alot more speanded alot of their time for the fans and work. When they can be with their familys!!!

Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be marked saying that they @MONTH1 be found offensive.      From my own experience I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion. Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it is harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do.      Have you ever read the book The @CAPS1? If you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea. They think that it is wrong. Again some people @MONTH1 try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful literature.     As you @MONTH1 have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3 removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native americans by a more profound word. The law has not passed yet and has remained in schools. The law hasnt passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people @MONTH1 not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed.      Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people @MONTH1 find the books offensive while others @MONTH1 not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appauling. The book @MONTH1 only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isnt that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section.      I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my obersavations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in thier hands. Once again I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive"

People do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them. Take the book, @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that.      Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them.              Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it. Just imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less.      Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it"

there was you..Oh now I've never been to Heaven, no, but I've been told,   Streets up there are lined with gold..REMOVING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A GOOD IDEA. I DO NOT AGREE BECAUSE, THE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE GONE FOR GOOD. THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON BOOKS. BOOKS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE SHOULD BE ONLY ALLOWED TO ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP, THIS WILL HELP WITH CHILDREN NOT BEING SCARED, TO HELP KEEP HISTORY AROUND AND, FREEDOM OF SPEECH.     BY MAKING AS AGE LIMIT ON CERTAIN BOOKS, WE CAN KEEP CHILDREN INACENT AND PURE. WITH BOOKS SUCH AS '@DATE1', KIDS @NUM1 OR UNDER SHOULD NOT READ THAT BOOK. @NUM1 AND UNDER ARE STILL NIEVE. LITTLE KIDS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT SEX OR EVEN PRE-MARRITAL SEX. WITH @PERSON1 AND IS GIRLFRIEND HAVING SEX EVERY OTHER CHAPTER, ITS VERY INAPPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ. ALSO, WITH ALL THE TORTURE PARTS, IT WOULD SCARE A LITTLE BOY/GIRL OUT OF HIS/HER MIND.     WHEN GETTING RID OF OFFENSIVE BOOKS, WE REMOVE HISTORY. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WOULD BE IF ANNE FRANK DID NOT WRITE HER DIARY. WE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW BAD HILTER REALLY WAS. WE COULD ONLY ASSUME. WITH GETTING RID OF BOOKS CAUSE THEY ARE 'OFFENSIVE' IS A RIDICULOUS REASON. BOOKS ARE ONLY OFFENSIVE TO SENATIVE PEOPLE. BOOKS KEEP HISTORY ALIVE! THINK: 'WHAT ARE WE WITHOUT HISTORY?'     FINALLY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WHY THEY SHOULD SAY. AUTHORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE WHAT THEY WANT. IF THE READER DOES NOT LIKE IT AND FINDS IT OFFENSIVE, THEN THEY SHOULD NOT READ IT. IF SHAKE SPEARE, WAS TOLD HE COULD NOT WRITE HIS STORIES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TRAGETY OF ROMEO AND JULIET. SO MANY BOOKS WOULD BE LOST IF SOMEONE COULD WRITE BECAUSE IT WAS OFFENSIVE.     BOOK THAT ARE TOO OFFENSIVE  OR INAPORITE FOR A CHILD TO READ THERE SHOULD BE A AGE LIMIT ON IT. IF WE GET RID OF CERTAIN BOOKS WE GET RID OF CERTAIN HISTORY AS WELL. GETTING RID OF THOSE BOOKS TELLS A NEXT COMING AUTHOR THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOES NOT MATTER TO OFFENCIVENESS. SO KEEP THE BOOKS AROUND, ITS ONLY WORDS"

your honey touch   This time you were cheating me   One time too much   Just then I remembered   That a friend I knew   Told me one thing   I should never do   Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night   Everything may look so different in the early morning light   Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark   What you're getting into may be just a lark   Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high   Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why   Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance   And don't fall for someone else's song and dance   Sure there was this guy   Right next to me   Mine just for the asking   He said he would be   But to leave my man   Seemed to me all too strange   And I'd say that I'm glad   I didn't make the change   Now our life is almost   Like a Paradise   Let me pass on to you   This advice   Keep your cool and don't change lovers in the middle of the night   You may feel a strong temptation, the vibrations may be right   But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool   When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool   Never never change your lovers under any midnight spell   Take it easy, slow and easy, everything will turn out well   Let the sunshine of a new day, and don't move while you're uptight   Changing lovers in the middle of the night   Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night   Everything may look so different in the early morning light   Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark   What you're getting into may be just a lark   Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high   Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why   Let your heat wear off a little,

her gypsy music till her brew was done   Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve   She told me more about me than I knew myself      She dealt two cards, a queen and a three   And mumbled some words that were so strange to me   Then she turned up a two-eyed jack,   My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black   She said the man you love is secretly true   To someone else who is very close to you   My advice is that you leave this place,   Never come back and forget you ever saw my face      Dark lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one   Danced to her gypsy music till her brew was done   Dark lady played back magic till the clock struck on the twelve   She told me more about me than I knew myself      So I ran home and crawled in my bed,   I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said   Then I remembered her strange perfume,   And how I smelled it was in my own room!.Watta show, what a fight   (Watta show, watta fight)      Yup, we

There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not.     What is too offinsive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.     If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.     People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways.     All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come."

Which the librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. the topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library.     Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, ect., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly senice the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library.     If you do not check out the materials that lis in the library nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. Which, if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and noone can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait til the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be check out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library.     If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, that means that noone will be able to check it out until it eithers gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the lmaterials because you lost the libraries copy of the materials that you check out. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore thay can only sit in the library to reas the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes. Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it the the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyon that wants it so the check it out.     These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library. There is alot more reasons you hve to check out materials from the library. So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that is in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library when ever you want it"

makes me feel good inside   Just to know that you're my son makes my heart swell with pride   I've always needed one like you to love and understand   Now that you've come to fill that place, you're my buddy, man to man   There comes a time when every boy grows so cocksure with life   So that he feels he knows it all and no longer needs advice   The complicated phase of life is called ""adolescent age""   And sometimes breaks a father's heart---wish you could skip that stage   I'd like to help you fill your heart with kindness, faith and truth   Protect you from the hands that reach out to destroy manhood and you   There is so much sorrow and despair to blight the hearts of men   And the more we learn of love and life, the more they come crowding in   It's just little things at first, my son, then, as we grow older   Our troubles grow much bigger too and sometimes, they overflow   The poisoned minds and broken hearts will cause strongest men to weep   Overwhelm souls with bitterness and death would be so sweet   So we must build a strong defense of love and fortitude   On character and knowledge, son, so these ills cannot intrude   Ah, Sonny boy, so many things a youngster needs to know   If he is to find true happiness as down through this life he goes   It's just a father's love, I guess, that comes to every Dad   That makes me want to shelter you from things that make you sad   Bosephis, boy, I'm standing by to help you when you call   For Son, you are my flesh and blood and the grandest pal of all.She will show you the way to go..Ain't she sweet?.Longing to sail on   Through the night to the stars   On until sunrise   Where the moon hides her tears   All through the years      If I could see the world through someone else's eyes   If I could see through you would I cast you to one side   And if you gave it all would I throw it all away   Like the leaves in autumn winds      From the window in the kitchen   To the fireside by the chair   Sat in familiar surroundings, warm night air   Under the bridges that were burning   Before we reached the other side   All the feelings I remember, I cannot hide   Not for want of trying      And if you held me here would the moment fade away   Into obscurity like the night becomes the day   For all the broken promises tell me where do I begin   To throw my caution to the wind      From the window in the kitchen   To the fireside by the chair   Sat in familiar surroundings, warm night air   Under the bridges that were burning   Before we reached the other side   All the feelings I remember, I cannot hide   Not for want of trying      From the window in the kitchen   To the fireside by the chair   Sat in familiar surroundings, warm night air   Under the bridges that were burning   Before we reached the other side   All the feelings I remember, I cannot hide   Not for want of trying      Longing to sail on   Through the night to the stars   On until sunrise   Where the moon hides her tears      Longing to sail on   Through the night to the stars   On until sunrise   Where the moon hides her tears      Longing to sail on   Through the night to the stars   On until sunrise

years   All through the years.Stronger than a magic spell   My love, for you      It's wider than the widest sea (how long?).No one could love more..To whom it @MONTH1 concern:          As time goes on in this ever-expanding world of ours, it seems that one thing that is constantly being fought and argued is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are viewed as 'offensive' to be comprimised.     People these days though. must be getting offended much more easily these days, because it seems that media is censored more than it ever has been. I for one, am sick of having the 'veil over the eyes' as it were. Most censorship in this country is run through programs our government has established, censorship shouldn't be up to a organization, but instead to the person viewing it. In other words, why should other people decide what is most pleasant for us to watch? Nobody knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide?      Why should censorship exsist in our media if it doesn't exsist in our everyday lives? There are plenty of things people see that they regret seeing, it's all in how you take it. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life.      Censorship denies our rights as @CAPS1 citizens to have the right for free speech. If you don't like something you're seeing, then look away yourself"

Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have and I also use to read them. In some of thouse issues are sex tips.           Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no. They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section.           Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex. But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also.           There are also some other things that need out of a librarie. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child. Like for example rap music. It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain. Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it. Thats not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse.              Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1. But if it is they can't watch it. I'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so. She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her. She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded.      This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries"

Do you think libraries should take more responsability on what they offer to people? Many people think they should. But I disagree, if they dont want to learn about that topic than don't read the book.          Public libraries are a great help for the community. They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home. Libraries do think about what information children view. That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age. Also its not always about what the library displays, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read. If to some people some information is offensive, to others it might not. People will always have different points of view.           This materials cannot be removed, they might be important in some  points of our lifes. All information is helpful in some way. The inmense ammount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone want to"

In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away.     A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do @CAPS4. Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. @CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature.     '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, @CAPS4 is not the case. @PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with.     Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning."

Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts.     Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together?     The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that reigion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them.     Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be"

However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc.       If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.      I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.      If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book.      Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.      One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.      The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person"

It's a public library. Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way.      Libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something, whether it be a book, movie or magazine. When people come in looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding good tips, and not being let down. Example, with something possibly about someone being racist. That's dissapointment to some. Noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them. It's not fair.     Now, to parents with children. Would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them? I highly doubt it. Unless, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days, but to the ones who want their child having a good education, well, you understand my statement.     It's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied, but instead are let down. It does them no good, and it could make your community look bad. Libraries are to help people with information, fun facts, and all around good resources. So, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc. away!"

an extent. I think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). If a consumer is the age of twelve and under; then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored.     Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing. Music, for example, alot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored. It does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending.     With books; people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece. Some books should be censored like alot of romance novels; those get pretty graphic and go into alot of detail with sexual themes and content. I do not think those books should be on the shelves.     In magazines; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person is reading a politcal magazine; those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine; then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them.     Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. If you are watching a movie on a @CAPS2 network like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3; those channels censor movies. If you watch movies on @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4 they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only. That is also why movies have ratings. R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , @NUM1 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult. and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are fine for any age group.     All in all; censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really. If you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products; if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' matierial"

all we share between us   Everything we were, all that we remain   But memories somehow came between us   Breaking up two minds that were one and the same      Since the last goodbye   It's all the wrong way 'round   Since the last goodbye   It's all the wrong way 'round.What will you do now the bridges have been burned?.You could rip me   Leave me torn and cold..In my life time I have been to many libraries. I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages.     Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now.     Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that @CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information.     Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as @CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, @CAPS3&@CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to.     In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive."

views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader.     The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of @LOCATION1, and shouldn't be taken away because one person @MONTH1 think something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship @MONTH1 dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, @PERSON1's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across.  If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it.This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor."

Reading should not be restricted by any means. If a person has an interest in a book, they should be able to read it if they so choose. I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done.     For a person to be able to take away another persons right to read a book of his or her choice, is mind boggling. I know that some books can be pretty desciptive and graphic but these boundaries sould be set within a home. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a book don't take in out on the entire community. It's not fair to everyone else.     If you personally don't find entertainment or enjoyment out of a book that you consider offensive, there are many other alternative books to read. Nobody is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, that is why there are many sections in a library. The sections in a library range from mystery to romance, so find a different book and leave the offensive ones to people who like to read them. That way you are happy and so is everyone else.     Libraries are places people visit to check out and read books. Usually a person chooses a book because of the cover or a friend has requested you to read it. If libraries start to remove books from the shelves then there won't be any left for the rest of us to read. Not only will there be no more books but there also won't be anymore libraries for people to go to.     Just because a few people think that there are some offensive words, scenes and or other ideas in a book doesn't mean that it is right to take away the privilidge of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, don't read it. It's that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of one persons opinion."

We do not need anymore reasons for people to judge someone based on something that they read.     If the media is offensive, than someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and it had some really offensive things about homeless people. I felt bad just for reading this, because it just made them sound like horrible people. Which in a lot of cases isn't true, but I remember people that read it and they believed of every word of it. Those people now rudely look down on them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many more books.     There is a lot of offensive music too. Today most of the songs people listen to are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, cause anybody could rent them. Which isn't good, cause they could really hurt someone's feelings by just singing a song they think is okay.     Another thing libraries need to watch are magazines. Most magazines are okay, but some like to throw in little inapproiate stories. So to really protect everyone and anyone they need to really go through the magizine and make sure its not offensive at all.     The media I think libraries really need to sit down and think over if they are okay, or not are definately movies. They need to realize that kids could rent these, and think are they apporiate. I think libraries should only have family oriented movies. This way nobody is harmed by anything they will veiw.      In conclusion, libraries should be extra careful in their media choices. They need to try and limit everything that is offensive, to try stop anybody from getting harmed"

There is several book in the library that young children should read. I don't believe that you a certian book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. The possable things that could be done is; move those book to a higher shelf, designate a certian area for those books, or put an age limit on those books.     The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your childs, or any other childs hands is to move those book to a higher shelf. Doing this will keep those books out of your childs sight and reach. That will keep them out of childens hand, and prevent them from reading them.     The next possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any childs hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library. Doing this will provied a 'barrior', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area. You would also know where those books are so the you could make sure they don't go to that area.     The final possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any other childs hands is to put an age limit on those book to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them. This would make the childen have be a certain age before the can check them out, preventing them from reading them.      These are a few possabilities that could be used to keep offisive books out of childrens hands, and preventing them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them getting a hold of and reading"

Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe the be true or not true, or very improtant to them, also called freedom of speech. Also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @MONTH1 be appropriate.      I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then @PERSON1 was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.           Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @MONTH1 be as long as they are along the right age. If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and voilence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf. You do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that. People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but I also do believe there is a certain extent."

However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading @MONTH1 be offensive. Instead of removing the ofensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive.           These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this inlcude when we watch the news, we @MONTH1 see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants.           Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they @MONTH1 later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it.           There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an efffective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be ofensive.     Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it."

Have you ever came across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well that should never happen,  if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see.      Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read. For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well. The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them.     The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old. So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers. I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young. That is why I believe their should be censorship in every library."

There are fiction and nonfiction, comedy, horror, children books, and many more. Also what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children. They could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence.     When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while they're browsing around they could run into a certain book thats not meant for them and they could end up becoming influenced. A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a childs life because they could go out into reality and try to immitate a book they have read and it could end up being the wrong decision.     Inappropriate movie and magazines, such as pornagraphic magazines or pictures, rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library. Items like that should be sold in a separate store. Items like these are meant for adults only. We should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them.     The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violonce, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change. Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message to it.      I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it use to be and if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change. Eventhough I'm still young I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place."

One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to an older audience.     I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected. It @MONTH1 not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion @MONTH1 change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and costant arguments.     Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'.     Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they @MONTH1 mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children commiting these acts. If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for relaeasing this material to children. So the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained within your library"

friend, and how,   The land that you love the best, is asking you to invest,   With a personal request from mr. morgenthau..Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are childrens books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that @MONTH1 be inappropiate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy.     What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well.      Unfourtunately, there are some books that @MONTH1 cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories.     I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropiate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read.     A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy."

For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.  Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever.  Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things."

But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place."

thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.      Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it.      Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. @PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could.      Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out.      In conclution, @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser. @CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read"

Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety"

Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too"

be   And when you stop and think about it   You won't believe it's true   That all the love you've been giving   Has all been meant for you      I'm looking for someone to change my life   I'm looking for a miracle in my life   And if you could see what it's done to me   To lose the love I knew   Could safely lead me through      Between the silence of the mountains   And the crashing of the sea   There lies a land I once lived in   And she's waiting there for me   But in the Grey of the morning   My mind becomes confused   Between the dead and the sleeping   And the road that I must choose      I'm looking for someone to change my life   I'm looking for a miracle in my life   And if you could see what it's done to me   To lose the love I knew   Could safely lead me to   The land that I once knew   To learn as we grow old   The secrets of our soul   It's not the way that you say it when you do those things to me   It's more the way you really mean it when you tell me what will be      Why do we never get an answer   When we're knocking at the door   With a thousand million questions   About hate and death and war   'Cause when we stop and look around us   There is nothing that we need

Thats just how our country is we have different oppinions on everything we do. But we have to live with it, @CAPS1 are many different prespectives that come from old, young, parents, and children. In libraries @CAPS1 are some books,music, etc that @MONTH1 be offensive to people.     But we all have different oppinions therefore we can never listen to one pupil. Or it would start a fight between people that disagree with him/her. I think people that go into the library should be mature about what goes on in @CAPS1 otherwise they shouldn't be in @CAPS1 looking at whatever they are wanting to read about.          The library is opened for the public and has lots of knowledge it shares with us. But if we get rid of all the censorship then it denies people knowledge. The books that they would get rid of would be because of the children. Because parents don't want children to look @NUM1+ material that is not appropriate for them so they try to keep it hidden.     I think we should keep censorship around because it would deny knowledge to people if we did not keep it. And we should remind parents that some things in the library is not suitable for childrens eyes and let them be responsable for what thier children look at."

If they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. The auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set.     However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @CAPS1 magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.     Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge. But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you."

to or view what we want? I think it is unfair that the schools have the right to tell us what we can look at the right is ours this is america and we have the right to do what ever we want. I think we should have the choice to read it and if it is offensive then dont read it becuase it might be offensive to you but not everyone thinks it is volgare or rude and obsene.      I am asking you the paper to stick up with me and fight the school and tell them what they should be aloud to read because it is not right to censor good material just because some nut job does not like it.     That is all i am asking for is for you to stand up and back me up in this war on censorship."

The good side is profanity is it give books, music, and movies taste and texteure it shows how a person feels most times it's anger. Profanity also can change a person behavior, by the way people talk and act. I personally think that profanity is a good and bad i like it in music and movies but i hate it when people talk trash. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the person age for example age three and thirteen books should not contain profanity but ages fourteen and up can.           The reason why people should take it off the shelves is beacuse kids should have a healthy and profanity free life. They should have a a good development turds learning. Books and other intertaiment should have no profanity because kids at a young age learn easly and if they take in the bad actions of others they will be bad themselfs. The reason why people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity dont buy it. Also keep out of kids reach. The main reason why people swears is because of movies and songs it changes a person dramaticly. Talking with profanity in your mouth can change your life but not having a good job getting in jail raising up bad kids that learn from the parents mistakes.      In a @CAPS1 profanity is good for movies it gives it action and drama. profanity is words that are most times negative expressing anger and rudeness. We have a @CAPS2 full of profanity this is like a wide spred deases. Passing on from people to kids to their kids. I have expeariance this the hard way beacuse im chinese and i came to the united states back in @DATE1, i did not know any english. People would cuss at me all the time the could all be avoided if we didnt have any profanity in our daily usage of books, music, and movies. I have learned alot about people by the way they talk letting me know who to stay away from. We should keep profanity but limit it from kids. Profanity is like ice cream people wants it and other dont. People could make there choice of putting themselfs in a profanity free life. people can do what they think is the right thing to do. Taking it off the shelves for kids is what i think is the right thing to do but not adults.     Due to profanity people tend to put themselfs in truble. For example some people in the use gets pulled over by a officer for a low cost speeding ticket but then they would swear at the officer putting them selfs in more truble this could all be avoided if he didnt have ever said anything. Profanity could also make a good motivational speech i know this beacuse im on the @LOCATION1 football team. Before every game our coach would motivate us by giving us a speech to get us pumped up with profanity in it. So in the end what im saying is porfanity should say but keep it out of reach of kids for books parents dont buy them if you dont want your kids to see them. Movies read the lable on the back of the @CAPS3 and see the agae limit and for profanity. Lock up the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that have profanity in it so your kids have no acess to them. If you dont want any part of profanity you can make yourself to stayway from it. We all know the there is nothing you can do about others useing profanity just dont use it yourself and stay clean do what you think is right"

should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction"

If I dont like @PERSON1 and I tell @PERSON1 i dont like him @PERSON1 knows I dont like him so he wont talk to me any more.  So in a bigger picture if @LOCATION1 tells @LOCATION2 that we dont like thim they will not try to make friends with us any more.  so if everyone would speak thier mind the world would be alot better.     If a parent does not like some thing like a type of music, movie, or even book and they express that to thier kid they will learn that that thing is bad.  My dad tought me that it was fine to kill animals only if I am willing to eat them so that seams fine with me but other people might not think its right.  So I belive that if your not a hipocrite and live as you teach your kids to that your kids will listen to you.     As I have said before my dad tought me that its fine to kill animals if I am willing or going to eat them.  I find one exception to this rule cyotes (we have alot of cyotes where i live at and they can be a pest).  I belive that that is about the only exception to the rule because cyotes are problem animals in this area.     So if you dont want your kids watching rated @CAPS1 movies then block them on tv. Its the same thing with the other things like the magazines, books and music."

What @MONTH1 be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion @MONTH1 not be bad in others opinionated views. Everyone will have there own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library. Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to lisetn to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home? No, by censoring all that in public places like librarys or say video stores your helping fight a lot of trouble and concerns that could happen in the future.          Then again censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing. Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books. At the same time though we can't censor every single thing someone doesn't like. By removing something because one parent has a complaint over their child watching, or reading a book they thought was too 'vulgar' then your giving that right to any parent that complains about their child doing that. It's not the librarys responsibility to watch over everyones child, to make sure they watch and read what their parents want them to. Kids will be kids and they'll do what they want to do.          By censoring and taking things off shelfs of librarys your not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading about book they're not supposed to be reading. Censoring librarys is just like censoring words in movies, by doing that it's not stopping your child from hearing or learing vulgar language. Children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television.       What does the word offensive really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on whats offensive and whats not. Like i said, everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it. You can't remove everything off the shelfs because one parent doesn't think it's right for their child or other children to be seeing, looking at, or listening to. We all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to. By taking things off the shelfs that maybe other people like oppose to others then your taking that right away as a @CAPS1 citizen. Censoring on some things like, sex scenes in movies, or maybe vulgar language in music is alright in my opinion. Taking books off the shelf because you don't like the way its written or you don't like the person who wrote it, or you don't like the kind of language the author decided to use in it isn't alright to me, you're pushing the limit on that one. Books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination. By taking books off shelfs i think you're hurting a childs ability to grow.      Censoring is a good and bad thing. It could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow. Censoring some things are a good thing, but like i said not everything with vulgar language should be censored, or vulgar scences. Sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies"

I'd like you to teach me the way you move   Been down for so long   But now I'm up..You're the sweetest of all sweethearts..I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things.      Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it.     Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics. Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials.     Another factors is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf.     I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials. If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.     I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some."

Libraries are given to people for new learning opportuites and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two peoples are the same.     First of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library. Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is ment by this statement is that there are so many differnt types of writting that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library.      If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is proporty of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it. In truth they will not be the only ones who have that oppionin. It takes one person to make the difference.      Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their oppininons and will stick by them. Thats expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse oppions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressisng them eigther, actually its better that way only because then others can hear about a book and eigther agree with that oppionoin or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like.      Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their oppionion. To spread an oppion is to let the world know wehre someone stands on a spacific topic. Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinoin. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one.                                       ~~@PERSON1"

only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed.     Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed.     With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed."

A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. Let the libraries be!"

CAUSE WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE LIKES THE BOOK, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO READ THAT BOOK . MAYBE IT'S AN INSPIRATION TO THEM,MAYBE IT WILL DRIVE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THIER LIFE.  WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES, SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRIGHT TO THE AUTHER AND TALK TO HIM\HER. ABOUT THEIR BOOK.  THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRIGHTING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATEING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK ,ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSONSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HE OR SHE BOOK BROUGHT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. ALSO NO I DON'T THINK THAT THE BOOK/ BOOKS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVESCAUSE MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOTIVATE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN.

as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive.  First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive"

It is good to be unique, and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' @CAPS1 repeats it's self, and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south.      What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened. And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.     The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical.          Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex? @CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.     It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors. If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman"

Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer.  Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own.     In @DATE1's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch @CAPS2, they would rather their children not see a @CAPS2 disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against @CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @CAPS5 content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters.     Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech. By living in @LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it.     Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library.      In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us."

Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics.     Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side. That way parents can know and control what their children are seeing.     Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These sign could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', '@CAPS1 control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems.     Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that. Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve.     These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright. Putting up signs and requiring @CAPS1 control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances"

I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually. Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know.      People are not going to look at things the same. Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently. If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us. No more books, music, movies, and magazines.     Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are. American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind. So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer"
