"What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive?What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody?Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not.There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the @LOCATION2 it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people.If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries?Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future.When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything.like uh.. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for.Say a book on the asassination of @PERSON1 is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it.You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children.like so.. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge?so.. I mean ... Many people that do not have computers depend on the library.If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go?well.. like The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire.People would take their business elsewhere.so.. hmm Protests @MONTH1 break out and rebelious citizens @MONTH1 protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.The people would not be the only thing out of hand.uh.. erm The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell.@CAPS1 are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows.Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many @CAPS1.hmm huh uh.. so.. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents.The censorship @MONTH1 start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down.Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable.so.. well.. well.. uh.. What kind of society would we have then?Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten.Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable.If libraries were cencored, not only would  knowledge in the @LOCATION2 desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1.No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read?We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs.Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away",6
"I mean ... hmm A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world.The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people.like I mean ... In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of.That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion.erm hmm Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.huh huh like I mean ... Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries.@CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal.uh.. uh.. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events.Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people.In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public.It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong.well.. erm As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'@CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families.Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.'huh I mean ... um well.. @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration.There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries.Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that.When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive.If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item.That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately.uh.. huh One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed.Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1.A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive.Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society",5
"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes.um so.. However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes.@CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.Ahhh well.. We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.hmm erm People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.like hmm huh well.. Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson.um hmm Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out.uh.. huh Then, many words would be gone.Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.hmm um I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.like uh.. We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.hmm like If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2",5
"Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1.um I mean ... erm well.. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.'@CAPS1 what?One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas.This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day.Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary.Here's why.@CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways.I mean ... hmm For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person.Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend.Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend.so.. so.. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you.Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive.Ask yourself, is it right?erm I mean ... The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.um hmm There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive.@CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves.@CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve?Nothing.Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this.I mean ... hmm Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone.Ahhh hmm It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn.Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material?Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve?erm hmm huh uh.. Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong.",5
"Ahhh um huh so.. Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art.In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy.But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country.What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?so.. Ahhh Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies.Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2.In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed.huh well.. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies.The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves.The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities.erm Ahhh In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials.Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2.like like During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion.Ahhh erm But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country.The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.so.. like In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens.We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both.If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will?Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people?Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding.If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place.Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country.Are we descendants of those same people?If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'.They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'.Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services.um so.. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them.It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting.Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child.And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1?As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf.But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'erm I mean ... Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2.That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided.But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for.",5
"Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs.I mean ... I mean ... Some people @MONTH1 believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others @MONTH1 disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away.so.. uh.. If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 enjoy that book.I mean ... erm If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy.For example, I personally love horror movies.I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen.I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong.If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed.I also love video games.huh huh so.. like Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them.um well.. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed.I mean ... well.. I am also aware that people @MONTH1 just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them.I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer.Movies and books can easily be censored.Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch.Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's @MONTH1 require parental consent.um hmm Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game.so.. like We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 like it.like erm We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them",4
"Imagine your child or someone that is very close to you.He's only around @NUM1 old just starting to learn how to be an adult and take on responibliltys.He wants to try new things.He listeans to his friends talking about drinking alchol and how much fun is it.He thinks it sounds amazing to drink.He dosnt no something is bad about it or not.No one every told him.So he starts to drink an dlater died of alchol posing.Now, you dont want this to ever happen to someone who is very close to you.If people are to scared to talk about the bad things in life.Like sex, drugs, etc..Then they should make books and movies to show how bad these thing are.well.. hmm There should not be censorship in libraries.Some of you @MONTH1 say 'well there to young they cant hanndle these things yet.'well.. well.. @CAPS1 your opinon you should think of there maturity level, aslo they can learn from other peoples mistakes, and it would educate people.How do you tell on someones maturity level?There are many ways to tell.well.. uh.. If you talk to someone about sex and they start to laugh and make jokes then there not very mature.But, you cant asociate that every @NUM2 year old is immature.Many people @MONTH1 take this as a serious thing.Others @MONTH1 not but, they still will be able to see them in there own way.Putting censorship in libraries would not be a good idea.Many topics in books, movies, music, magazines, etc.. @MONTH1 have inapropte things in them.Like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language.Should all these things be taken out on libraires and off the shevles?so.. like @CAPS1 a hard question to answer.But, what you can answer from that is it would allow people to learn from there mistakes.so.. um If theres a movie and a guy and he is doing drugs and later dies.People could assume that drugs kill you.But, what about the other thing?Its hard to show how its bad to say an offensive word to someone, that they herd on the radio.But, when they here that word or read about something or watch.They can ask about it and we can say that saing those things or doing them can be offensive.so.. so.. Now, can you educate someone from letting the person listean, read , or watch about something offensive or etc..?It depends on the person.But, you can educate someone about the subject matter.No matter how offensive the topic is.I mean ... like We should teach people about them.If we dont, its bound to repeat it self.I mean ... huh Say if we censor the holocaust becuase of how horifying it was.Ahhh uh.. No one would no about it and we would most likely repeat the holocaust.Censoring certain things a library would not be that good of an idea.Ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects.Its not always a good thing to censor offensive subjects.We need to teach people about these thing to educate them, and also so they can learn on what has been done and not repeat it, also some people can handle these materials, they just need to have a high maturitly level.so.. I mean ... These are some reasons why there should not be censorship in libraries and other places",4
"well.. uh.. The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true , I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon.so.. erm huh well.. hmm hmm I remember when I was younger and  I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library , I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people.uh.. huh I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish.I mean ... uh.. hmm huh erm so.. Another time something like this occured was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magizine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions.like erm The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half , talk about having issues , anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well.Ahhh huh There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things , one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it.But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door , it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote , ' @CAPS1 speak louder than words '",4
"Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason.The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else.um I mean ... uh.. well.. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other.The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else.In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech.History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition.Ahhh erm like so.. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things.hmm erm The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it.well.. uh.. Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter.The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves.The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition.A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.well.. huh well.. erm uh.. hmm um um In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons.The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else.Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things.The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is.",4
"I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves.well.. like so.. uh.. I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to.You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want.The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing.um Ahhh If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits.erm uh.. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings.That is no excuse.The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it.so.. um Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around.Shows, movies,and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences.Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway.If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school.Ahhh huh These days children learn about things sooner and sooner.The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want.Ahhh huh It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else.They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it.That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed.It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want.A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf.like so.. like so.. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy.I mean ... hmm This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it",4
"I mean ... so.. Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2     The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country.Ahhh erm In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland.well.. erm In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech.If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc.it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1.well.. like uh.. so.. like well.. Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes.Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything.If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn?There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation.When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive.For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same.uh.. um Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.I mean ... huh I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television.Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good.Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage.If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.um well.. If books, movies, magazines, music, etc.well.. um are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom.",4
"erm so.. um Ahhh well.. hmm erm I mean ... huh uh.. erm so.. so.. hmm um erm well.. like like like There are some certain materials i think is affensive to childrens is book,music,movies an even magazines.Books have a lot of materials unsafe for children because they can get a hold to @CAPS1 books and other unsafe materials.Another thing is music, and even music videos has a lot of profanity in them.Movies such as @CAPS1 movies some children @MONTH1 watch them and reflect wat they have watched on tv.The next thing is magazines,has material such as appropreate pictures in them tats why they should take the books,music,movies and magazines off the shelf.",2
"um like huh so.. Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a section made for adult readers only.like so.. Ahhh uh.. I mean ... like This way no children would see the book anyway.so.. um um like um I mean ... so.. uh.. If an offensive book is in a school or any other place that the readers are children for the majority than it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf.hmm like All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience.",2
so.. like hmm well..  No they should not have the cd's books and  etc off the store shleves.I mean ... erm they should leave them on the shelve si think.um Ahhh erm I mean ... like uh.. they should olny remove the old video games.so.. Ahhh hmm I mean ... and books and music.huh like so.. so.. every other,1
well.. huh like like Ahhh so.. uh.. so.. uh.. well.. huh like  Well people should be able to get whatever they want if there an adult kids should not but what can you do.so.. like um um um uh.. uh.. erm It wouldnt be right to take away things that people like.,1
"erm I mean ... um well.. hmm well.. Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I'm here to talk about why I thing we should have these certain materials in the libraries.so.. like Why I think these materials should stay well because,  For @CAPS3 lets say its a certain movie or song or book or whatever just that one thing you were looking for, for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happening to go to the library just to look.huh uh.. Even though  you know its not there, but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you where looking for.And what if you wanted to look for a myster book and only the library had that book you where looking for.um hmm I can think of alot of reasons why we need certain materials.so.. um hmm I mean ... um um well i guess that about sums that up for me.And in concultion put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes.so.. well.. What would you do?would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay.",1
