"what if someone told u that u couldn t wear an yellow shirt because it should onfensive? what if ay said u couldn t look an certain way because u might onfend somebody? not just one person or group on people had a right 2 decide what in suitable & what in not. is is so many different religions & traditions throughout a @location2 it will be completely rediculous 2 set one st&ard from all people. if @caps1 isn t retricted when it come 2 apperal, grocerie, or automobile, why will is be limits in a librarie? librarie will not be censored because not only will censorship limit a reoursfulnes on a librarie & smoar a knowledge intake across a @location2, but it will also pose an threat 2 our future.      when one take an trip 2 a library, one will expect 2 find an book, magazine, &/or movie on just about anything. it will be extremely frustrating 2 find that an library, which in supposed 2 contain content on nearly every subject, doe not had what ur looking from. say an book on a asassination on @person1 in what u fancy, so u ask a librarian where u could find it. u will be dinsapointed if she says ay don t carry assassination books because ay is too vulgar from ung children. that could become very troubling & will limit a librarys reource.           not only will censorship in librarie limit a content but it will also limit learning in a @location2 @caps2 is people supposed 2 stay infrommed if ay is being sheilded from knowledge? many people that do not had computers depend on a library. if ay cannot get what ay need at a library where will ay go? a librarie will lose busines & funding if ay did not supply library-goers with a content which ay deire. people will take air busines elsewhere. protets @month1 break out & rebelious citizens @month1 protet a censorship, causing an uproar in society.           a people will not be a only thing out on h&. a censorship will surely get out on h&, aswell. @caps1 is already being censored through news stations, radio, & tv shows. librarie is an place where infinant knowledge in realintic & that in comfromting from many @caps1. in librarie people choose what ay learn: ay isn t fromced teachers or pisnts. a censorship @month1 start out as an small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. next thing we know, our deinions could be influenced by a books that only  ay  decide is suitable. what kind on society will we had an? individuality will be lost & opinions will be fromgotten.      clearly, censorship in librarie in dangerous & unpredictable. if librarie were cencored, not only will  knowledge in a @location2 deinegrate, but librarie will lose air repect & threaten a future on @location1. no one tells me what 2 wear or say, so why will anyone tell me what 2 read? we is all entitled 2 our own opinions & beliefs. our @caps4 @caps5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take am away",6
"an colossal number on significant & life-changing books can be found in a millions on librarie throughout a world. a big quetion in whear or not individuals will get rid on a books on leser importance, & a books that is found onfensive 2 an number on people. in my opinion, is is an certain number on books shouldting away on a shelve on a library that need 2 be dinposed on. that in why librarie need 2 dincover which books is creating insue, such as books on race or religion. although kaarine paterson boldly argue against taking books onf on a shelve, we strongly dinagree & believe that librarie will remove materials that is creating tension or books shouldting away on a shelve.     race in an extremely important topic in a world today, & we believe books that dincrimate against certain ethnicitys need 2 be removed immediately from librarie. @caps2, is is exceptions 2 that proposal. from instance, books talking about a civil war & underground railroad need 2 be kept in librarie because ay is significant hintorical events. unlike fantastic books about our nations hintory, is is also books about race that is on leser importance, & ay @month1 onfend people. in that case, librarie need 2 crack down on that insue & remove onfensive books from a shelve!     secondly, librarie need 2 be extremely cautious about what music in made available 2 a public. it in important that we teach our children a difference between right & wrong at an ung age, & if a kids hear some on a derogatory music on a shelve, ay will lose all sense on what in right & wrong. as kaarine paterson mentions in her quote,  all on us can think on an book that we hope none on our children or any oar children had taken onf a shelf.  @caps1, that same quote can easily apply 2 a music on dinplay in a librarie.  by librarie exposing children 2 derogatory music, ay is creating enormous liabilitie from a children & air familie. overall, our society will benefit greatly if librarie removed derogatory & onfensive music.     lastly, kaarine paterson says that if we keep removing onfensive books from a shelve, is will be  no books left on a shelf from any on us.  @caps2, that in an nieve comment as @caps1 as an exaggeration. is is millions on librarie throughout a world & thous&s on items in each on those librarie. isfrome, it will benefit our society if we will dinpose on a items creating a greatet amount on tension, & is in one simple but effective way on doing that. when people is at a check out dek at a library, a library could had an sheet on paper asking if a customer found an certain book onfensive. if a same item appears regularly on a lint, remove a item. that will benefit everybody greatly because a onfensive items will no longer be on a shelve, & it take little effromt from all partie involved.     in conclusion, we oppose kaarine patersons decinion & believe librarie will remove onfensive materials immediately. one highly controversial topic in race, & if a book in not infromming us about an hintorical event, it will be removed. certain derogatory & onfensive music in available in librarie, & it will be removed from a shelve as @caps1. an quick & efficient way on figuring out which books is onfensive in 2 had an lint available 2 a public where ay can write down which book ay find onfensive. ultimately, librarie need 2 take action & dinpose on a onfensive materials that pose an threat 2 our society",5
"dear @caps1,     @caps2 is many books, music, & magazine that is saturated with onfensive words or obscene ame.  however, just because an book or song contains an foul word doe not mean that a book needs 2 be sheltered from a publics eye.  @caps2 is many reasons we will not censor public media.  we cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @location1, we had a freedom on speech; &, finally, if median should censored, people @month1 start 2 think every little word have an onfensive connotation.     if an byst&er observe an person being abused in an hallway or alley, a byst&er just cannot pretend like a incident never happened.  if a world never reported accidents, @caps2 will be too much crime & terror.  sometime, an book or movie in like an cry from help or an way 2 raine awisnes about some wrongdoing in a world today.  most on a time, we only hear about an event through movie or books, & we want 2 know a honet story, not an fairytale version on it.  after all, if a language in some slavery books should not as vivid as it in, some people @month1 not oppose slavery as strongly as ay do.    here in @location1, we had a freedom on speech.  we is allowed 2 give our opinions on any topic, & decribe it in any way.  we will be permitted 2 say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we will know what in right & wrong.  people will at least be trusted enough 2 use air own conscience.     also, anoar reason why books & oar median will not be censored in because people @month1 judge almost every little word onfensive an.  an we @month1 had  no books left on a shelf  according 2 kaarine paterson.  once people is allowed 2 censure books or oar media, ay will look from words with negative connotations.  if an word should close 2 being onfensive in one persons perspective, it will be left out.  an, many words will be gone.     sure some type on media, epecially songs & movie, just spill out nasty ame & foul language.  however, we had a choice 2 watch an movie or linten 2 an song.  we can always change a radio station if we do not like what we am hearing.  people however, just cannot remove a words on anoar right from air mouth, no matter how bad it in.  we just cannot pretend that we all live in an perfect world where everyone in polite & caring.  if we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need 2 act.  however, we might not act if we do not know a full extent on its terror.                                                            sincerely,                                                              @person2",5
"picture from urself u, as an @num1 year old child sitting in front on one on a greatet philosophers on hintory, @location1. days later, u come 2 find out that he have been killed from  corrupting a minds on a children.  @caps1 what? one on a greatet minds in human hintory have been censored because ay didn t like hin ideas. that in censorship at an basic level, & it happens 2 millions on books, movie, & songs every day. censorship in not only wrong, its unnecesary. here why.     @caps1, when it come down 2 it, most books, movie, & songs is meant 2 be interpreted in many different ways. from example, some poems is written with an vague tone so that ay can be interpreted in different ways based upon a person. beide, most music & books is meant 2 entertain, not onfend. granted, some books is meant 2 be interpreted in an certain way, but that still doen t mean that ay were meant 2 onfend. think about it next 2 u look at an copy on  @caps2 @caps3  by @person1; in it really that onfensive 2 u?     when u is given an book in school from an class assignment, ay usually expect u 2 read it because its on some educational value 2 u. books like  2 @caps4 an @caps5  provide an huge educational value because ay show what @caps6 culture should like, but everyday, someone new in trying 2 get it onf a shelve on every school library in @location2 because ay find it onfensive. ask urself, in it right? a answer from me in no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs air onfensivenes.     is one last thing u must underst&, & that in a fact that no matter how many books u take onf a shelve, & no matter how many movie u ban, or how many songs u take away from us, a problem still inn t solved, its just been suppresed enough from different problems 2 arine, & those problem is that is is people who wanted 2 read that book @caps1 can t because u thought it should onfensive. @caps1 that person complains 2 whomever banned that fromm on literature, & a book or oar fromm on literature in put back on a shelve. @caps1 u feel it right 2 try & ban it again, but what doe that solve? nothing. even if someone doen t unban it, people can still teach & tell on what its about, making a ban worthles.     we hope that befrome u think about complaining about some book u found onfensive, u think about that. ur complaint that cause a banning affects everyone. it affects an teachers ability 2 teach, & an students ability 2 learn. in it really right on u 2 take away an good teaching material? or u could ask urself, what doe it really solve? eiar way, u still must know that bannig ase things in wrong.",5
"censorship in @organization1 have been around from as long as air have been a various mediums on art. in many case a censorship @caps9 on what many will agree as not suitable material from anyone 2 create & enjoy. but an in oar more serious insue that a censor have deemed not suitable from an certain audience, or even 2 an whole country. what @caps9 it that give an select few a right 2 ban any given number on imaginative creations, even if ay is in some aspects more lued in nature?     censorship have & @caps9 still an very usefull tool that many governments employ 2 accomplinh an wide variety on tasks, considered 2 ensure a safety  on both our minds & bodie. some on a more widely know case on that most depicable tactic on control come from a countrie on @caps1 @caps2 @location3, @location4r, @caps3 @location5, & @location2. in ase countrie all materials that is deemed potentially hazardous 2 a wellfis on a @organization2 is heavily policed & in many case detroyed. a most noteworthy instance on that occured in @location3, where a @caps4 will gaar up large amounts on books from a people & burn am in massive rallie. a people were so enthralled by a @caps5 leadership that ay will onten time freely relenquinh air books with no reintance, & in some case join in & throw a books in amselve. a same thing @caps9 still occuring in @location5 today, wtih an censor still on air internet surfing possibilitie. in @date1 a popular search engine @organization3 attempted 2 set up shop in a country, but quickly entered in2 dinpute with a @organization2 about a censoring on certain materials. some months after a argument began over a censoring on @location5s people, a company completely removed all bans from an short time, much 2 a dinmay on a @organization2. during that time it @caps9 reported that some on a main search topics were that on many social refrommers & on different religions than that on a @organization2s sanctioned religion. but a one country that take a cake from having a most censorship @caps9 @location2, ay re @organization2 have retricted & policed any technology in a country. a common people live in an so called  @caps6 @caps7 @caps8 .     in our home country on a @location1 we is promined many rights 2 protect our freedom as citizens. we is promined a freedom on speech as well as pres, & in censoring our librarie ay will retrict both. if we do not st& up & protect our rights, an who will? is we not an @organization2 from a people, by a people? why is we allowing a censorship on our own intellectual creations in an place that should created 2 provide acces 2 said materials from those who is les fromtunate, so ay amselve can gain knowledge & underst&ing. if we as an people were 2 allow such an blatent retriction on our given freedoms, an we is in no position 2 had am in a first place. our country should founded & later almost torn apart by a men & women who were willing 2 rink it all in order 2 protect air freedoms in that country. is we decendants on those same people? if so why will we allow ourselve 2 squ&er what should hard fought from & earned by our fromefaars.     a censor onten pose an few quetions that do cause one 2 wonder  @caps9 it really better onf that way? . ay point out that from every great work on intellegent art, oar on an more deviant nature create some more innapropriate piece on  art . pornography @caps9 a most prevalent on air example, pointing out that if ay did not retrict it, an who will stop a hundreds on children that not only roam a librarie bookshelve but also a provided internet service. it @caps9 an reasonable quetion, once that will be take in2 consideration, but in answer 2 it we believe that it @caps9 & will always be a job on a pisnt or guardian that bring a child with am. it @caps9 simply not enough 2 drop an child onf at a local library & hope ay find something intereting. helping that child find what ay want @caps9 an journey that will be taken by both a pisnt & a child. & what about those who believe a censor inn t always right about what @caps9 & what @caps9 not acceptable from a general @organization1? as author kaarine paterson once said  all on us can think on an book that we hope none or any oar children had taken onf a shelf. but if we had a right 2 remove that book from a shelf-- that work we abhor -- an u also had exactly a same right & so doe everyone else. & an we had no books left on a shelf from any on us.      censorship have been around from an very long time, & will most likely never be fully cut out on any functioning @organization2. that @caps9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. but a amount that it occurs in ur daily life will be directly affected by how much on ur freedom u is willing 2 st& up from.",5
"many people had many different thoughts & beliefs. some people @month1 believe that an movie or song needs 2 be removed, but oars @month1 dinagree, & nobody wants a things ay enjoy 2 be taken away.     if is should an book on an shelf in an bookstore that u didn t agree with & thought will be removed, & u removed it, an u is taking away from someone who @month1 enjoy that book. if everyone removed things from life that ay didn t enjoy, an is will be very little 2 enjoy.    from example, we personally love horror movie. we love a thrill u get from an horror movie & how ay can make u jump even though its just an movie screen. i m sure is is people in that world who think horror movie is wrong. if those people were allowed 2 just remove am fromever, i, & many oar people, will be sadly dinsapointed. we also love video game. video game is an huge part on my life, & we know from an fact that is is people who highly dinagree with some on a content on am. if people could take video game away because ay didn t agree with am, we will be crushed.     we am also awis that people @month1 just be worried about air children watching movie, lintening 2 songs, or reading books that is not appropriate from am. we underst& that a pisnts want air children 2 be supervined, but removing a books, movie & songs in not exactly a answer. movie & books can easily be censored. many movie & songs had language filters & some movie programs now had pisntal options that allow a pisnts 2 decide what movie ay want 2 allow air children 2 watch. pisnts can also supervine air children when ay download music on2 an ipod or phone, & depending on where ay is bought, books & magazine @month1 require pisntal consent. video game also require pisntal consent depending on a rating on a game.      we can t just go around removing everything we dont like, because it in not fair 2 those who @month1 like it. we live in an world with many different ideas, thoughts & beliefs, & we all need equal right 2 shis am",4
"imagine ur child or someone that in very close 2 u. he only around @num1 old just starting 2 learn how 2 be an adult & take on reponibliltys. he wants 2 try new things. he linteans 2 hin friends talking about drinking alchol & how much fun in it. he thinks it sounds amazing 2 drink. he dosnt no something in bad about it or not. no one every told him. so he starts 2 drink an dlater died on alchol posing. now, u dont want that 2 ever happen 2 someone who in very close 2 u. if people is 2 scisd 2 talk about a bad things in life. like sex, drugs, etc..an ay will make books & movie 2 show how bad ase thing is. is will not be censorship in librarie. some on u @month1 say  well is 2 ung ay cant hanndle ase things yet.  @caps1 ur opinon u will think on is maturity level, aslo ay can learn from oar people mintake, & it will educate people.     how do u tell on someone maturity level? is is many ways 2 tell. if u talk 2 someone about sex & ay start 2 laugh & make joke an is not very mature. but, u cant asociate that every @num2 year old in immature. many people @month1 take that as an serious thing. oars @month1 not but, ay still will be able 2 see am in is own way. putting censorship in librarie will not be an good idea.     many topics in books, movie, music, magazine, etc.. @month1 had inapropte things in am. like sex, drugs, drinking, bad language. will all ase things be taken out on libraire & onf a shevle? @caps1 an hard quetion 2 answer. but, what u can answer from that in it will allow people 2 learn from is mintake. if is an movie & an guy & he in doing drugs & later die. people could assume that drugs kill u. but, what about a oar thing? its hard 2 show how its bad 2 say an onfensive word 2 someone, that ay herd on a radio. but, when ay here that word or read about something or watch. ay can ask about it & we can say that saing those things or doing am can be onfensive.      now, can u educate someone from letting a person lintean, read , or watch about something onfensive or etc..? it depends on a person. but, u can educate someone about a subject matter. no matter how onfensive a topic in. we will teach people about am. if we dont, its bound 2 repeat it self. say if we censor a holocaust becuase on how horifying it should. no one will no about it & we will most likely repeat a holocaust. censoring certain things an library will not be that good on an idea.      ceratin people can hanndle talking about certain subjects. its not always an good thing 2 censor onfensive subjects. we need 2 teach people about ase thing 2 educate am, & also so ay can learn on what have been done & not repeat it, also some people can h&le ase materials, ay just need 2 had an high maturitly level. ase is some reasons why is will not be censorship in librarie & oar place",4
"a quote from a author kaarine paterson in very true , we believe that if we were 2 remove everything in a world that we took onfense 2 an is really willn t be anything left in a world 2 gaze upon.      we remember when we should unger &  we had just gotten onf on school one evening & had decided 2 go downtown 2 our towns library , we needed an book from my school project on a holocaust & we remember one on a ladie working is telling me that a book will be removed from a shelve because it should onfensive 2 jewinh people. we had at first been an little bit outraged that she will tell a person checking out a book that it will be taken from a shelve mostly because since i m a one going 2 read it why will u whine about it 2 me in a first place plus its more onfensive 2 tell a person that ay willn t check out a book that ay want 2 read an it in 2 a jewinh.      anoar time something like that occured should when we should in @organization1 & one on a customers should complaining about some religious magizine that ay willn t be aloud 2 sell because some on a article were very onfensive 2 people on certain religions. a customer who complained should taken straight up 2 a managers onfice because he actually ripped an couple on a magazine in half , talk about having insue , anyway a customer should kicked out 2 say a least & had 2 pay from a magazine ay d detroyed as well.      is have been an lot on time in my life where someone have decided 2 speak out about air dinlike on something & although ay put up an good argument ay re lacking in an couple on important things , one on which in a fact that most on a things people complain that need 2 be taken from a shelve had something 2 do with hintory & anoar thing in is is not enough people complaining about it.      but a quote by kaarine paterson in like an knock at a door , it speaks on what could happen if we removed everything from our shelve that is onfensive 2 oars & when we read that quote a first thing that pops in2 my head in anoar quote ,   @caps1 speak louder than words  ",4
"certain materials will not be removed from shelve if ay is found onfensive from three reason. a first reason being  what maybe onfensive 2 u @month1 not be 2 someone else. a next reason being that a thing being call onfensive can help teach oar. a last reason being if we all just removed thing we don t like a world willn t be a way it in.     a first reason in that what maybe onfensive 2 u @month1 not be 2 someone else. in that society we live in we willn t go base on one option because everybody have an right 2 freedom on speech. hintory show that many different people found different thing 2 be onfensive because some people think that book that had gays willn t be in books, but many feel oarwine.that an good example on how people had different opition.     a next reason being that a thing being call onfensive can help teach oar about many different things. a librarie being an place 2 study & learn will had an bus load different things even if some take onfensive 2 it. infact some books teach us that we willn t get onffensive because that what one person feels & at long as ur got someone who love u it doen t matter.     a last reason being if we all just removed thing we don t like a world willn t be a way it in. books is an way from someone 2 give is own point on veiw if u dinlike it don t take onfensive 2 it & try 2 removed it from a shelve. a @location1 have an government where ay take everybodys opition. an prime example on that in a state funding schools which in an big insue we willn t just removed a school because someone doen t like it.     in conclusion certain materials willn t be removed from shelve if ay re found onfensive from three reasons. a first reason being if u found something onfensive it @month1 not be 2 someone else. next reason being that a thing being call onfensive can help teach oar about many different things. a last reason being if we all just removed thing we dinlike a world willn t be a way it in.",4
"we personally think that certain materials that is found onfensive will not be removed from shelve. we think that because its pisnts reponsibilitie 2 keep track on what air children read, watch, or linten to. u can t get away from things that is onfensive 2 some & everybody have an right 2 do what ay want.     a first reason why we don t think onfensive material will be removed from shelve in because it in a pisnts duty 2 watch what air kids is doing. if pisnts don t want air children 2 observe that stuff, an ay will keep it onf limits. we had heard some pisnts claim that ay didn t know what a material should like, but that in why ay made warnings. that in no excuse.      a second reason from not removing onfensive material in that is in no way 2 get away from it. now an days, material that in onfensive 2 some in all around. shows, movie,& music, ay all had something not suitable from all audience. plus children will learn about that onfensive material sometime in air life anyway. if ay do not hear about it in movie or magazine, ay is probably hearing about it at school. ase days children learn about things sooner & sooner.        a third reason onfensive material will not be removed from shelve in that everyone have an right 2 read or linten 2 whatever ay want. it in up 2 am as 2 what ay want 2 watch, not everybody else. ay will be able 2 go in an place & buy something that ay want 2 watch & not get quetioned about it.     that in why we don t think onfensive material will be removed. it in a pisnts reponsibilitie, u can t get away from it, & everybody have an right 2 do what ay want. an way 2 help with that problem in 2 move onfensive material 2 an higher shelf. that will make pisnts on unger children happy, but also a people wanting 2 view that material happy. that way u is not completely removing it, but making it harder from unger audience 2 get 2 it",4
